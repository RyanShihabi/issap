Cygnus NG-13 Mission: The NG-13 Antares 230+ launch vehicle, carrying the Cygnus vehicle S.S. Robert Henry Lawrence Jr., was successfully launched from the Virginia Space Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport’s NASA Wallops Flight Facility at 2:21 pm CT today. The Antares launch vehicle ascent was per the plan and a nominal orbital insertion of the Cygnus spacecraft was achieved. Once on-orbit, the Cygnus solar array deployment was completed nominally and the NG team is not tracking any issues. The Cygnus spacecraft is scheduled to rendezvous with the ISS on Tuesday, February 18th with an estimated capture time of 3:00 am CT. Joint ISS/Cygnus operations are planned to last until mid-May of this year.
