ISS On-Orbit Status 06/04/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – crew rest day. At wake-up, Garan conducted another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, his 20th.      [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] The three crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of the uborka house cleaning, CDR Borisenko & FE-1 Samokutyayev completed regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM (Service Module), preceded by documentary photography, and the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on its total operating time & “On” durations for reporting to TsUP. Samokutyayev also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~10:00am EDT, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. Performing periodic service on MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker/Incubator) in the Lab (O4_D1), FE-3 Garan moved the contents of the cold storage container into MERLIN-2 next to it, removed the desiccants in MERLIN, and propped the door open so the unit can dry out prior to return on STS-135/ULF-7. On Day 2 of the ongoing SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop reloading with software v.4 (SSCV4), the crew had ~30 min set aside for moving their personal data from SSC clients to T61p USB 120 GB hard drives in preparation for Monday’s & Tuesday’s SSCV4 transition activities.      [Of the (currently) 24 SSC laptops in the ISS (SM: 3, Node-3: 1, Node-1: 1, A/L: 1, Cupola: 3, Lab: 7. JPM: 1, Node-2: 6, COL: 1), 13 will be reloaded with v.4 by the ground, 7 by the crew.  After replacement of the remaining IBM A31p laptops with Lenovo T61p’s, the machines will be configured by the crew (12) & ground (9), leaving at the end 23 T61b SSCs in service.] FE-1 & FE-3 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sasha at ~4:45am Ron at ~11:25am EDT. Jobs listed for Samokutyayev & Borisenko today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens   [uplinked targets included plumes from volcanoes Etna & from Karymsky, detailed photographs of the Kuril Islands, and deforestation in the Taiga in the Far East],A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,An audit/inventory of onboard SFOG (Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator) candles,Repacking 9 full-size CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) in the RS (Russian Segment) for transfer to the ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) for disposal as per USOS agreement, andPreparing & downlinking more reportages (text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).

FIR/LMM/CVB (Fluids Integrated Rack / Light Microscopy Module / Constrained Vapor Bubble):     “Ron: Thank you for your excellent work changing out the Bio sample! We truly appreciate the time you took to get the camera view perfect for us. The zoomed in view was especially nice as we could see the samples sliding in and out of the base. Please continue to set up the camera in the same way for all the changeouts you will perform.  The investigation of Bio Sample 4 was completed on 6/1.  Sample 4 is an adherent live cell sample that was designed to grow more slowly than Sample 1.  Images were taken at multiple magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x and 63x).  This second round of Bio samples demonstrates additional capabilities for LMM since the 40x and 63x were not used during the first round.  The two remaining samples, Sample 5 (planaria or flatworms) and Sample 6 (fluorescent c. elegans or roundworms -- a continuation of a sample from the first round of Bio), are scheduled for next week.” Fish Scales (JAXA):     Completed on FD7/ULF-4 and returned on STS-132.

GEOFLOW (ESA):    On 5/20 unexpected parameter changes in the Optical Diagnostics Module (ODM) were observed.  Analysis of the data by the payload developer led to the decision to reload the ODM Application SoftWare (ASW), which was successfully performed on 5/31 and allowed us to resume the GEOFLOW-II runs.  An update of the new EP for no-rotation runs, with the temperature of the coldest sphere (Tcold) = 30.5degC, was tested on 5/31. The behavior of the thermal control was very stable with this new EP and the run was finished on 6/1 without any skipped setpoints.  However, due to the HCOR outage on 6/1, the data from 1 setpoint is missing.  The availability of three different EPs allows us to perform all but the high rotation runs with frequencies above 1.6 Hz which are still impacted by the belt slipping problem of the Experiment Container Rotating Tray. HAIR (JAXA):    No report. HDTV System (JAXA):   Cancelled set up and check out on 6/1 & 6/2. Hicari (JAXA):    Continued trouble shooting, completed N2 injection then deactivated GHF on 5/13.

We look forward to working with you on our task listed payload.  Already through 6/1 we have received 564 CEO frames for review & cataloging.  We are pleased to report the acquisition of the following targets with times corresponding to those of our daily CEO Target Request lists:  Sian Kaan Bay Mangroves, Yucatan, Mexico - partial, oblique coverage of this target area was acquired, but more clouds were present than anticipated - we will continue to request this target; and Kampala, Uganda - a single oblique view of this capital city was acquired - we will continue to request this target to obtain a more nadir view.  We are delighted with your early response to our first two target lists and your interest in using the camera to photograph our beautiful planet.  We will continue to provide you feedback whenever we can on your progress in meeting our target requirements.” CEO targets uplinked for today were Cairo, Egypt (Cairo is the capital city of Egypt and is the largest city in Africa.  It is also one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with an estimated population of 6.8 million people living within the city, and an estimated 10 million living outside the city proper.  Documenting land use and urban boundaries), Kwanza Basin (general views were requested to document a thin string of new developments [infrastructure such as main roads, power lines, and settlements along the roads] between the capital city, Luanda, and new oilfields inland.  Critical features will be acquired with overlapping images.  The rationale behind imaging this site is to document planned and unplanned changes in the Luanda-oilfields corridor developing between the coastal capital city, Luanda, and the new oilfields to the NE.  Few usable images have yet been acquired, mainly due to the presence of a continuous equatorial cloud), Mbabane, Swaziland (this small capital city has a population of approximately 95,000 and lies in a wooded highland.  There are no images of this city in the CEO database), Fairchild Botanical Garden (Fairchild Botanical Garden contains an extensive collection of rare tropical plants, flowering trees and vines.  It is located in metropolitan Miami, just south of Coral Gables.  Requested were mapping strips of the area in order to document the land cover and color), and Ubinas Volcano, Peru (ISS had a nadir pass over Peru's most active volcano Ubinas; some clouds may have been present.  Overlapping frames of the volcano summit and flanks were requested.  Recommendation was to commence photography as ISS crossed the Peruvian coastline and to terminate the Ubinas session ISS approached Lake Titicaca as the best means of capturing the volcano).
