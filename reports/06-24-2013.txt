New Status:
Russian Segment (RS) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #33: Flight Engineer (FE)-2 Misurkin and FE-4 Yurchikhin egressed the ISS at 8:32 am and performed a 6 hour 34 minute EVA. During this time, FE-3 Cassidy and CDR Vinogradov were isolated in the Mini Research Module (MRM)-2/34 Soyuz. FE-5 Parmitano and FE-6 Nyberg were isolated from the Functional Cargo Block (FGB) forward in the US Segment. The following tasks were completed:
· Kurs test in preparation for Multi-purpose Laboratory Module (MLM) arrival
· Replacement of panel #2 of Flow Control Valve (FCV) on the Functional Cargo Block (FGB)
· Installation of cable clamps for power supply cables on the FGB in preparation for Russian EVA 34
· Installation of the INDICATOR science hardware of CONTROL space experiment on MRM2
· Removal of VINOSLIVOST space experiment panel on Mini Research Module (MRM)-2.
· Removal of PHOTON-GAMMA science hardware from URM-D on Plane IV of SM [POlg.dia.]
· Installation of three of five gap spanners for EV crew translation along SM
During the EVA, Cassidy took photos of the Starboard and Port Solar Array masts. This photo survey will give a base configuration to assist ground teams in comparing Micro Meteor Orbital Debris (MMOD) strike probability against actuality.

Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS and maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to provided viewing support to Russian Segment (RS) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 33. At the completion of the EVA, the Robotics Ground Controllers maneuvered the SSRMS back to a park position.
Advanced Colloids Experiment (ACE)-1 Sample Preparation: Nyberg prepared sample well B3 for the 3rd of 10 planned runs for Increments 35 and 36. She mixed the sample, dispensed oil to the sample and installed it into the Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR) Light Microscopy Module (LMM). The FIR team then powered up and perform a ground commanded science run. ACE-1 is a series of microscopic imaging investigations that uses the microgravity environment to examine flow characteristics and the evolution and ordering effects within a group of colloidal materials.
Skin-B Experiment: Parmitano conducted the second of five sessions of this experiment and downloaded the data. He then disconnected and stowed the hardware. This study investigates the mechanisms behind how skin adapts/regenerates under the influence of weightlessness and the environmental conditions in spacecraft on long duration missions.
Ocular Health (OH) Experiment: Parmitano and Nyberg completed their visual test for visual acuity, visual field, and contrast sensitivity. Eye health activities will continue Wednesday when, with assistance from Cassidy, they will perform Tonometry and Fundoscope exams. OH is a suite of eye exams to gather information on intraocular pressure and eye anatomy.

Sound Level Meter (SLM) Readings: Parmitano used a SLM to complete part 1 of an acoustic survey of the FGB and US modules, including the Amine Swingbed in US LAB. The survey was broken up into two parts due to the EVA isolation, and will be conducted on Thursday.  The crew will measure acoustic levels in the ATV4, SM and DC1.
