SpaceX (SpX)-3 Launch/Berth, Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 26 Status: The ISS Program elected to target April 18th and 19th for SpX launch attempts. Teams are evaluating the following options:

SpX launch on 4/18, berth on 4/20 and EVA 26 on 4/23
SpX launch on 4/19, EVA 26 on 4/20 and SpX berth on 4/22

Body Measures Investigation: Wakata, with the help of Mastracchio, conducted his Return-30 session of Body Measures. Wakata set up body marker instrumentation and took calibration and body pose pictures along with circumference measurements. He then recorded a neutral body posture video. The goal of this study is to gather data to better understand the magnitude and variability of changes due to microgravity and fluid shifts within the human body during long-duration space flight. Results of the investigation may result in changes to space suit fit and sizing, workstation design, etc. for future missions to maximize performance, prevent injury, and reduce crew time to accommodate their anthropometrics.
EVA 26 Preparations: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Swanson and FE-5 Mastracchio prepared the equipment lock, Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) and ancillary hardware to support EVA prep activities. Commander (CDR) Wakata, Swanson and Mastracchio performed suit fit checks on EMUs 3005 and 3011 to make any adjustments to suit sizing prior to the EVA.
