ISS On-Orbit Status 10/03/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. FE-6 Hoshide started the day with another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 27th for him.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 & RSS2 laptops. Yuri also conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  FE-4 will terminate the process at ~5:15pm EDT.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday.  (Done last: 9/12 & 9/13).       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hrs and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.] Before breakfast & exercise, Malenchenko & Hoshide each completed a 10-min session with the periodic Russian MedOps test MO-10 "Hematokrit", which measures the red cell count of the blood, with one of them acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer, Russian: “Examiner”).  Yuri then stowed the equipment.  It was the 2nd session for Yuri, the first for Aki.       [The blood samples were drawn from a finger with a perforator lancet, then centrifuged in two microcapillary tubes in the M-1100 kit's minicentrifuge, and its Hematocrit value was read off the tubes with a magnifying glass.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.  After the exam, the data were saved in the IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).] Malenchenko ran another 90-min checkout test of the new Russian experiment TEKh-62 ALBEDO, using the FSS Photo Spectrum System at an SM window. Before sleeptime, Malenchenko initiates charging the battery of the TEKh-62 payload. Later, Yuri continued the new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today first working in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok).    [Using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush, Yuri cleaned the interior closeout panel vent screens 116, 316, 231, 431.] Afterwards, FE-4 moved to the SM to clean the Group B fan system. CDR Williams reactivated radiation dosimetry data collection with the Italian ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts)-Shield. Yuri Malenchenko conducted the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] Afterwards, FE-4 performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-4 also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, working from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Akihiko configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 3rd (FD75) session of the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, assisted by Suni Williams in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres.  At ~6:35am EDT, FE-6 observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.  Later in the day, Aki swapped Makita batteries and set them up for recharge.        [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] Suni conducted the continuing preventive inspection & cleaning of accessible AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) system bacteria filters in Node-1, Node-2 & Node-3, with photo documentation. The CDR performed periodic maintenance on the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) by cleaning and lubricating its beverage adapter to maintain functionality. In the Kibo lab, Hoshide performed the JAXA MICB (MICROBE-3) experiment in the Kibo lab by starting the ASD (Air Sampling Device) and particle counter attached on the bottom of the Kobairo Rack GHF (Gradient Heating Furnace), and later inserting the samples with the air filter from the ASD in a Ziploc bag in MELFI-4, Dewar 4, at 2 degC.     [The ASD is part of the NASA/JSC SWAB (Surface, Water and Air Biocharacterization) experiment equipment.] Hoshide also serviced the WRS (Water Recovery System) by starting the periodic pumping of water from CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine) #2041 into the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly Waste Water Tank). Later, Aki had ~1h45m for starting prepacking return cargo for the SpaceX-1 Dragon capsule. At 4:05am EDT, FE-6 held the weekly JAXA crew conference via phone with staff at SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center) at Tsukuba, Japan. At ~11:05am EDT, Suni Williams supported a PAO TV event, responding to two interviews,- one with CNN (S. Gupta), the other with New York Times Science Reporter Kenneth Chang. CDR & FE-6 were scheduled for their standard weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via - & Ku-band audio/video, Suni at ~1:00pm, Aki at ~1:45pm EDT. Before Presleep (~3:30pm), Williams powers up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Before sleeptime tonight, Yuri will turn on the RSE-LCS laptop again to commence recording for TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communication System). The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.] Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) to exercise recording target positions on the surface of the Earth, andA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.
