53 Progress Docking:  53P was manually docked to the Service Module aft port at 4:30 pm CST. The Progress vehicle launched Monday, November 25 carrying more than 1400 kg of cargo including a spare Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) Fluids Control Pump Assembly (FCPA). 
Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR) Video Compression And Recording Unit (VCRU) Software Checkout:  Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Wakata activated MSPR components and changed the software configuration of the MSPR Laptop for the VCRU. He then performed a checkout of the new configuration. This activity is in preparation for the Zebrafish Muscles experiment which will arrive on the 54 Progress (54P) vehicle. The MSPR has 2 workspaces and a work table that can be used for a wide range of space environment experiments in the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), including those that require an aquatic habitat or combustion chamber.
Binary Colloidal Alloy Test (BCAT)-C1 Experiment: FE-5 Mastracchio completed the second run of BCAT-C1 Sample 3 after homogenizing the sample and taking photographs of the mixed sample. A camcorder provided live High Definition video during the run.This CSA experiment studies nano-scale particles dispersed in a liquid, known as a colloidal suspension, commonly found in such commercial commodities as paint, electronic polishing compounds and food products. These suspensions have the unique property that the particles phase separate and the particles self-assemble into crystals that interact strongly with light. Photographing these samples in microgravity allows the measurement of these processes while avoiding the effects of particle sinking due to gravity.
eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS (VIABLE) Experiment:  Wakata reviewed VIABLE Onboard Training (OBT), then touched the palm of his hand to experimental materials located on the top covers of VIABLE 4 bags.  He also blew on experimental materials located on those covers. This activity is performed every 45 days and the bags are photographed at 6 month intervals. VIABLE involves the evaluation of microbial biofilm development on metallic and textile space materials located inside and on the cover of Nomex pouches. Microbial biofilms are known for causing damage and contamination on the Mir space station and the ISS.  The potential application of novel methodologies and products to treat space materials may lead to improvements in the environmental quality of confined human habitats in space and on earth.
Biological Rhythms 48 Hour Experiment:  Wakata completed a session of JAXA’s Biological Rhythms 48 hour experiment, removing the Digital Walk Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Actiwatch and saving the accumulated Holter data. This study examines the circadian variation of astronaut’s cardiac autonomic function during space flight. The research is expected to provide insights into changes in those functions before, during and after long-duration space flight and may be used to improve the health care technology used for future ISS crewmembers.
Biological Experiment Laboratory (BIOLAB) Commissioning Completion: Mastracchio performed the Triplelux Experiment Containers (EC) swap from Rotor A to Rotor B. Ground teams then completed commissioning activities and the crew stowed the Biolab equipment.  BioLab is a multiuser research facility used to perform space biology experiments on microorganisms, cells, tissue cultures, small plants, and small invertebrates. BioLab will allow scientists to gain a better understanding of the effects of microgravity and space radiation on biological organisms.
