Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 27:  Wiseman and Gerst conducted EVA 27 today with Wilmore providing support using the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).  Phased Elaped Time (PET) for today’s EVA was 6 hours and 12 minutes.  They completed all primary objectives as follows:

Retrieved Failed Pump Module from Payload ORU Accommodation (POA) and installed onto Express Systems Pallet (ESP)-2
Replaced External TV Camera Group (ETVCG)-13 light which will be checked out after a 24-hour thermal conditioning
Installed Mobile Transporter Relay Assembly (MTRA) which will allow the Mobile Base System (MBS) and any equipment on it to receive heater power if the Mobile Transporter (MT) fails to complete a translation.  A quick checkout of the MTRA was performed and was nominal
Stowed Adjustable Grapple Bar (AGB) on the spare Flex Hose Rotary Coupler (FHRC) located on ESP-2

Mass Memory Unit (MMU):  The Columbus MMU2 did an automatic handover to MMU1.  At this time MMU1 is not functioning, resulting in a loss of redundancy.  Columbus can operate in this configuration for the near term.  Specialists will be reviewing to determine follow-on steps.
