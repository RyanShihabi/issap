SpaceX (SpX) Crew Dragon Demonstration 1 Undock and Splashdown: Following five days docked to the ISS, today the SpX Crew Dragon Demo 1 successfully undocked. Physical separation occurred at 1:32 AM CT with splashdown within the anticipated landing zone in the Atlantic Ocean at 7:45 AM CT. SpX’s two recovery ships were positioned nearby to recover the spacecraft and return it to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. This uncrewed flight test marks a significant step towards returning capability to launch astronauts on a U.S. built spacecraft from U.S. soil. Plasma Krystall-4 (PK-4): Today the crew initiated 3 runs of group 4 for the PK-4 study, performed a chamber cleaning and deinstalled the video monitoring equipment. PK-4 is a scientific collaboration between the ESA and the Roscosmos, performing research in the field of “Complex Plasmas”: low temperature gaseous mixtures composed of ionized gas, neutral gas, and micron-sized particles. Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory (SABL): The crew completed teardown of the Microscope hardware from the SABL-E2 unit in preparation for upgrading Lab ER-1 with an Improved Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway (iPEHG) next week. The Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory (SABL) supports a wide variety of experiments in the life, physical and material sciences with a focus on supporting research of biological systems and processes. It has over 23 liters of temperature-controlled volume with LED lighting for scientific hardware and experiments. It can be fitted to provide 5% CO2 for cell cultures and has 2 USB 2.0 ports and 2 Ethernet LAN connections. It also has switchable 28vdc and 5vdc power supplies for experiment use. Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: Today the crew completed an On-orbit Fit Check Verification (OFV) for ExtraVehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) 3008 in support of upcoming P4 Integrated Equipment Assembly (IEA) Channels 4A and 2A Battery EVAs planned for March 22 and 29.
