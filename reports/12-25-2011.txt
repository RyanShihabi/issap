ISS On-Orbit Status 12/25/11  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Sunday �C Crew off duty. Ahead: Week 6 of Increment 30 (six-person crew).  Merry Christmas to All!  С pождеством всем!  After wakeup, Anatoly Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov, FE-2 Ivanishin, FE-4 Kononenko, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module). ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]  As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM. Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection.  Anton Shkaplerov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM. This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for calldown. [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].  Dan Burbank completed the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. [Crewnote from Dan: “Both CGBAs nominal config with good temps and incrementing clocks.”]  In the COL, Kuipers serviced the ROALD-2 (Role of Apoptosis in Lymphocyte Depression 2) experiment. [FE-5 removed the two remaining ECs (Experiment Containers) from the KUBIK-3 thermostatically controlled container (+37 degC) and transferred them to MELFI-1 (-80 degC) to preserve the scientific samples. The dummy EC was installed in KUBIK-3 and the centrifuge restarted.]  Don Pettit & André Kuipers went on a search for a urine pH kit for the Pro K protocol which was delivered on Progress 45P and unloaded. The Teflon bag with the kit was to be stowed temporarily for Pro K. [Under the Pro K protocol, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days. The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]  André completed his daily task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for his first week in space. (Photos of the two questionnaires from his time on Soyuz were downlinked to the ground).  The CDR retrieved & stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies, deployed on 12/23 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground. [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]  FE-5 & FE-6 had their (currently daily) post-arrival PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, André at ~12:30pm, Don at ~12:45pm EST.  CDR, FE-4, FE-5 & FE-6 conducted their Holiday PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~7:00am, André at ~8:50am, Dan at ~10:50am, Don at ~1:35pm.  The “old” crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).  Shkaplerov’s & Ivanishin’s Russian discretionary “time permitting” job today called for continued preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
