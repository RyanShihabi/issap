Crew Off Duty Day: The USOS crew was off duty following yesterday’s successful Extravehicular Activity (EVA).
Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD): Today, 2 Dove satellites were successfully launched from Deployer #2 and an additional 2 Dove satellites were launched from Deployer #4. Two separate deploys are scheduled for this evening.
NeuroMapping:  Virts connected the control pad to the Human Research Facility (HRF) laptop and launched the NeuroMapping application. He completed the Mental Rotation I Test, the Sensorimotor Adaptation Test, the Dual Task Test while tethered, and the Mental Rotation II Test while free-floating. He then exited the application, closed all windows, shut down HRF PC1, disconnected the Control Pad, and stowed the hardware.  Spaceflight Effects on Neurocognitive Performance: Extent, Longevity, and Neural Bases (NeuroMapping) studies whether long-duration spaceflight causes changes to the brain, including brain structure and function, motor control, and multi-tasking, as well as measuring how long it takes for the brain and body to recover from those possible changes. Previous research and anecdotal evidence from crewmembers returning from a long-duration spaceflight suggests that movement control and cognition are affected in microgravity. The NeuroMapping investigation utilizes structural and functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (MRI and FMRI) to assess any changes to crewmembers after a six-month mission on the ISS.
TripleLux-B:  Cristoforetti was scheduled to unstow and gather tools and perform the Triplelux-B activity. Due to an issue with the Biolab smoke detector failing to initialize, she Removed & Replaced (R&R) an Exchangeable Standard Electrical Module (ESEM) board in the Biolab that was suspected to be the issue. However, this did not fix the problem and TripleLux activities were aborted for the day. Teams are working a troubleshooting plan.
