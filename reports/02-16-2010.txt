ISS On-Orbit Status 02/16/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  Half-duty day. Sleep shift in effect:  The ISS crew’s workday began last evening at 4:14pm and ended this morning at 7:44 EST (see time table at bottom).  At wake-up last night, FE-4 Kotov did the regular daily “early-morning” check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-4 again inspected the filters this morning before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Later, Kotov also completed another periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]  FE-1 Suraev again checked the status of the running TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) equipment, taking structural dynamics measurements.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]  TJ Creamer performed his second INTEGRATED IMMUNE liquid saliva collection (after the first one on 2/14), starting right after wake-up.  Saliva samples are taken every other day for six days, with the final one on the morning of the blood draw, and the samples are stored at ambient temperature.     [Along with NUTRITION (Nutritional Status Assessment), INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmember soak a piece of cotton inside their mouth and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]  Kotov, Suraev, Williams, Creamer & Noguchi started out with the periodic before-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IM mass measurement device.  Suraev set up the IM and later stowed it away again.  Additionally, Maxim & Oleg also did PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.     [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IM "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ].  FE-5 Noguchi powered up the CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System) in Node-3 and then assisted CDR Williams on the CBMs (Common Berthing Mechanisms), first demating the PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3) at the Node-2 Zenith port, then transferring it to the Node-3 Port CBM and remating it, verifying first & second stage capture.  The SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) was operated by Patrick & Behnken.  Afterwards, the SSRMS ungrappled the PMA-3 and maneuvered to TRRJ Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint) viewing position for closer observation and photography.  Meanwhile, Terry Virts & Kay Hire worked several hours on continued outfitting of the Cupola including ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) and UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) installations.    [ATU installation in the Cupola vestibule required removal of a corner panel from the launch configuration due to interference, and going behind panels, so it had to be done first after the vestibule outfitting.]  Cupola outfitting activities completed by the crew include:    Removal of the internal MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) closeouts, Reconfiguration of the thermal loop lines, Removal of the Cupola CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System) assembly, Installation of ground straps, Mating of 1553 data & power connections, and Depressurization of the Cupola to 5 psi (pounds per square inch) to allow the Fine Leak Check to be conducted overnight.  After the relocation and installation of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) in Node-3 on 2/14, Soichi today powered up the ARED from UOP-4 (Utility Outlet Panel 4) for an unmanned ACO (Activation & Checkout) inspection.  Later, TJ and Jeff followed up with a manned ACO workout run on the exerciser in its VIS (Vibration Isolation & Stabilization) in its new location.  Maxim Suraev completed the periodic update of the AntiVirus program in four Russian VKS auxiliary laptops (RSS2, RSK1, RSK2, RSE1), which are not loaded from the ground, from a new uplinked program copy of Norton AV on the FS (File Server) laptop, first scanning the latter, then transferring the database by flash drive to the other computers and scanning them one by one.  Oleg & Maxim conducted another 2-hr session with the Russian KPT-12 BAR experiment (#21/22), taking background environment parameters in the RS (Russian Segment) behind various panels, using the AU-1 Ultrasound Analyzer, UT2-03 Leak Indicator and Iva-6A Thermal Hygrometer to identify potential condensation areas.  Afterwards, data were downloaded to the RSE1 laptop, log tables filled out for OCA downlink and the equipment restowed.      [The Iva-6A, TTM-2 and Kelvin-Video probes took air & dew point temperatures behind panels 433, 434, 429, 202 & 404.  The AU-1 was used in areas close to the pressure shell before panels.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  The payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]  The FE-1 also performed the regular weekly maintenance on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation & Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time & date values.  Williams completed the weekly offloading of the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) from WRS (Water Recovery System) Rack 1 into a CWC-I (Collapsible Water Container-Iodine) with the common H2O transfer hose (which took about 23 min) from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary Port, then flushed the system.    [UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) processing has met the target of the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) being 65% filled and was shut down.  RFTA R&R is planned for tomorrow.]  TJ Creamer deployed the new SODF (Station Operations Data File) Emergency Book associated with Node-3 ingress and operations procedures.  In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), TJ moved and reconfigured the IWIS (Internal Wireless Instrumentation System) UOP to accommodate future JAXA activities.  CDR, FE-1, FE-4, FE-5 & FE-6 had their periodic PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Oleg at ~9:24pm, Max at ~9:49pm, Jeff at ~11:09pm, Soichi at ~11:49pm, TJ at ~12:19am EST.  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR, FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive device (CDR, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).  At ~4:09am-5:09am EST this morning, the joint crew held an in-depth one-hour review of procedures for the EVA-3 spacewalk, with egress scheduled tonight at ~9:14pm EST.  At ~6:39am, Behnken (EV1) & Patrick (EV2) began their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) in the A/L with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, assisted by CDR Zamka, followed by mask prebreathe (~6:39am-7:44am) and sleep from 8:14am-4:14pm tonight (sleep for the ISS crew began earlier, at 7:44am).  A hygiene break is scheduled for 4:54pm-6:04pm.    EVA-3 objectives: Open Loop B QDs, install PMA-3 heater cables, remove Cupola MLI, release Cupola window launch locks, disconnect LTA cable, and some get-ahead tasks.  The RWS (Robotic Work Station) will be relocated to the Cupola by Soichi in the “afternoon”.  IVA support will be provided by Steve Robinson.  The PMA-3 to TRRJ (Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint) photogrammetry, i.e. verifying clearance between PMA-3 and the TRRJ, was completed (by ground control).   Sleep shifting started with the Progress docking on 2/4.  On 2/6, crew wake shifted earlier, to 5:40pm EST.  Revised Wake/Sleep table:         FD Cal GMT WAKE EST  SLEEP EST    10 17-Feb 48 4:14pm (2/16) 7:44am   11 18-Feb 49 4:14pm (2/17) 6:44am   12 19-Feb 50 3:14pm (2/18) 6:44am   13 20-Feb 51 1:00am 4:30pm   14 21-Feb 52 1:00am 4:30pm    No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
