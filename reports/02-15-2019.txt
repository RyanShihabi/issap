Astrobee: Today the crew participated in a final crew conference, followed by the Docking Station installation in the JEM.  When the satellites arrive on orbit (starting with the NG-11 vehicle), Astrobee will consist of self-contained, free flying robots and a docking station for use inside the ISS. The robots are designed to help scientists and engineers develop and test technologies for use in microgravity, to assist astronauts with routine chores, and give ground controllers additional eyes and ears on the space station. The autonomous robots, powered by fans and vision-based navigation, perform crew monitoring, sampling, logistics management, and can accommodate up to three investigations
Nanoracks CubeSats Deployer (NRCSD) Removal: The crew removed the CubeSat Deployers from the MPEP (Multi-Purpose Experiment Platform), removed the MPEP and Passive Capture Mechanism from JEM Air Lock (JEMAL) Slide Table, and removed the MPEP Adapter Plate.  These are clean-up activities following the successful NRCSD-15 CubeSat deployment on January 31 and prepare the JEMAL for the next user.  The NRCSD is a self-contained CubeSat deployer system for small satellites staged from the ISS.
Time Perception: Using a head-mounted Oculus Rift display, headphones, finger trackball and laptop computer, the crew performed the Tim Perception science sessions.  A program on the laptop induces visual and audio stimuli to measure a subject’s response to spatial and time perception in a microgravity environment. The accurate perception of objects in the environment is a prerequisite for spatial orientation and reliable performance of motor tasks. Time is fundamental to motion perception, sound localization, speech, and fine motor coordination.
