ISS On-Orbit Status 11/14/10 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday – Crew rest day.   Ahead: Week 8 of Increment 25. >>>Today 41 years ago (1969), NASA/KSC launched Apollo 12, the 6th crewed flight in the Apollo Program and the 2nd to land on the Moon, after its Saturn V launch vehicle was struck by a lightning bolt during liftoff.  Charles “Pete” Conrad & Alan Bean spent 1d 7h in the Ocean of Storms where they visited the Surveyor 3 lander, while Richard Gordon stayed aboard the Command Module in orbit.  The highly successful mission ended on 11/24.<<< After wake-up, CDR Wheelock, FE-6 Walker & FE-3 Kelly performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift (therefore, for the next sleep shift sequence RST is scheduled twice daily from 11/1 through 5 days after the STS-133 crew lands).  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Also at wake-up, FE-1 Kaleri conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Alex again inspects the filters before bedtime (4:30pm EST) tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] FE-5 Yurchikhin’s morning inspection today included the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. Scott Kelly completed servicing the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) galley fridge, today installing 2 fresh desiccant packs after letting the cooler dry out for 24 hrs.    [MERLIN is used for cold storage of crew food and drink.] Shannon Walker concluded her 5th and last ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~12:25pm EST).  Data download from all devices to the HRF (Human Research Function) PC1 laptop will be scheduled later.     [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] Alex Kaleri completed final activities closing up Progress M-07M/39P, docked at SM Aft port, for the case of an EVA-26 contingency, specifically –Installing the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the SM Aft port  [StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB, MRM2 and DC1],Activating the spacecraft’s electronics and taking out the ventilation/heating air duct; Removing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking & internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) which rigidized the joint  [during clamp removal and leak checking, Russian thrusters were inhibited from 4:40am-6:25am due to load constraints],Closing the SM/39P hatches (~5:00am); Starting the standard one-hour leak checking of the SU docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and SM, andDownlinking the formal report on loading completion and the video depicting the close-out interface, for review by ground specialists. Oleg Skripochka & Fyodor Yurchikhin finished up their paced preparations for tomorrow’s spacewalk, by –Refilling the RDBs (Russian Drink Bags) of their Orlan-MK suits,Configuring MRM2 “Poisk” and Soyuz 24S for Kelly & Kaleri’s lockout tomorrow,Readying both NIKON D2X cameras for the excursion, andRetrieving three “Pille-MKS” radiation dosimeters and first setting them up in DC1 (A0311), MRM2 (A0312) & MRM1 (A0313), then recording their dosages and equipping each of the two Orlan-MK suits (in pocket on left calf) with a sensor unit (A0311/FE-2 & A0312/FE-5). Later, Oleg completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers]. Oleg also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for reporting to TsUP. Doug Wheelock, Oleg Skripochka & Fyodor Yurchikhin had 90 min set aside for EVA-26 timeline review and update. FE-2 & FE-5 took their standard pre-EVA PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Fyodor at ~10:40am, Oleg at ~10:55a EST. CDR & FE-3 were scheduled for their weekly PMCs, via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Scott at ~11:20am, Wheels at ~3:25pm. The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.] EVA-26 Overview:–      EV1 – Fyodor Yurchikhin, Orlan-MK #4–      EV2 – Oleg Skripochka, Orlan-MK #5–      Wakeup:  11/15 – 1:00am EST–      DC1 Hatch Open:  9:30am–      Hatch Close & Repress begin:  ~3:40pm–      Sleep:  8:40pm (11/15) – 6:00am (11/16,  i.e., 5h sleep extension)–      Wake:  6:00am (11/16) – 4:30pm (return to nominal)–      EVA Objectives (6h10m):•          Conduct space experiment “Test” on SM & DC1 (i.e., take samples from external surfaces),•          Install the URM-D portable multipurpose work station on Plane IV of the SM RO l.d.

No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today. JAXA Payload Status: Myco 2nd Sample Collection was scheduled on ULF5 flight plan.  With ULF5 slipped to after 23S undocking, it is rescheduled to Week 9 (just before 23S leaves with Wheels & Shannon).PCG (Protein Crystallization Growth) experiment is in progress in Ryutai Rack. Temperature in the equipment is stabilized and the experiment is going well so far. The PCG sample will be returned on 23S.Marangoni Exp-4 has just passed the halfway point (12 of 24 days as of 11/12) . All experiments have provided “very rich data which satisfy our science team”.  This experiment will continue until the end of this year.
