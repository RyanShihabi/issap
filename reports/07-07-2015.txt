Fine Motor Skills: Kelly executed a Fine Motor Skills experiment this morning when he performed a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet. Fine Motor Skills studies how fine motor performance in microgravity trends/varies over the duration of a six-month and year-long space missions; how fine motor performance on orbit compares with that of a closely matched participant on Earth; and how performance trends/varies before and after gravitational transitions, including the periods of early flight adaptation and very early/near immediate post-flight periods.
Journals: Kelly completed a Journal entry today in support of the Behavioral Issues Associated with Isolation and Confinement: Review and Analysis of Astronaut Journals experiment.  Journals obtains information on behavioral and human issues that are relevant to the design of equipment and procedures and sustained human performance during extended-duration missions. Results provide information which helps prepare for future missions to low-Earth orbit and beyond.
Regenerative Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) Recycle Tank Remove and Replace (R&R): Kelly R&Rd the Water Recovery System (WRS) recycle tank including the brine and distillate 100 micron filters as part of this regularly scheduled maintenance. 
S1 and P1 Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MDM) Patch Updates – Today patches were uploaded to the S1-1, S1-2, P1-1, and P1-2 MDMs to prevent the Solenoid Driver Output (SDO) retry counter from erroneously incrementing when an External Thermal Control System (ETCS) loop isolation valve is commanded. The software issue with the incrementing SDO retry counter was highlighted in January 2015 when the incrementing counter resulted in an Ada exception in the P1-2 MDM
