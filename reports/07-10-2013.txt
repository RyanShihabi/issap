New Status:
Post-Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Operations: Today was a half-duty work day for the USOS crew following yesterday’s EVA.  Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy and FE-5 Parmitano completed their post EVA health evaluation with FE-6 Nyberg acting as Crew Medical Officer (CMO). All 3 USOS crew members participated in an EVA debrief with ground teams.
USOS EVA #23 Preparations: In preparation for next Tuesday’s planned USOS EVA #23, Cassidy and Parmitano completed an EVA tool configuration this morning. Additionally, based on crew request during the EVA debrief, Cassidy performed a fill of his backup Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) for use during USOS EVA #23.
Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE)-8 Payload Experiment Container (PEC)/ Optical Reflector Materials Experiment Ram/Wake (ORMatE-III R/W) Pack: Yesterday Parmitano taped the vent ports on the MISSE8 PEC retrieved during the EVA to minimize oxygen exposure. Today, he and Nyberg finalized packing and photography of the PEC and ORMatE for return on a future flight.
