External Thermal Control System (ETCS) Loop A Status:  All Interface Heat Exchangers (IFHXs) are still bypassed and isolated from ETCS Loop A, resulting in half of the loads in the Node 2, JEM and Columbus modules to remain powered off.
Extravehicular (EVA) Preparations: In preparation for Saturday’s planned EVA, Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Mastracchio completed pre-EVA loop scrub maintenance for EVA Mobility Unit (EMU) 3011. FE-3 Hopkins, Mastracchio, and FE-6 Wakata reviewed procedures associated with EVA Hardware, tasks that will be performed during the upcoming EVAs, and Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) operations. Wakata configured two D2X cameras with 28 mm EVA lens and installed an EVA camera blanket over the cameras in preparation for use in the upcoming EVAs.
Lab Truss Contingency Jumper Installation:  In preparation for Loop A shut down during the upcoming EVAs, the crew installed the Lab Truss Contingency Jumper which provides power to the DDCU S01A downstream loads.
Biochemical Profile: Wakata completed his Flight Day (FD) 30 Biochemical Profile and Repository blood draw.  Human Research Facility (HRF) Rack 2 was activated on auxiliary power in accordance with the power limitations imposed by the current ETCS Cooling Loop A configuration.  Blood and urine are commonly used to assess an astronaut’s health as well as conduct research in physiological disciplines by measuring key biomarkers found in these fluids.  ISS crewmembers collect, process and store blood and urine samples obtained during the preflight, in-flight and postflight phases of ISS missions. A database of results from the analysis of the samples will provide metabolic profiles of the effects of spaceflight on human physiology.
