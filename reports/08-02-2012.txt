ISS On-Orbit Status 08/02/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Progress M-16M/48P (No. 416) successfully docked last night at 9:19pm EDT in the automated mode after a 4-orbit rendezvous & docking profile to the DC1 Docking Compartment with hook closure at 9:27pm.  All Progress systems operated nominally.  This was the first time the 4-orbit rendezvous docking profile was implemented for Progress (similar to what was done during the Gemini Program).    [Next were the standard 1-hr leak checking, opening of the hatches and installation of the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking & internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling, followed by the standard air sampling inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M air sampler, powering down the spacecraft and installing the ventilation/heating air duct, taking photographs of the internal docking surfaces for subsequent downlinking, and dismantling the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC1.] For supporting the Progress M-16M/48P docking last night, the crew was split in two shifts, with USOS crew remaining on nominal time:   Crew 1 (Padalka, Revin, Malenchenko):Sleep1 – 12:00am (this morning)Wake1 – 9:00am (today)Sleep2 – 5:30pm (today)Wake2 – 2:00am (tomorrow, return to nominal) Crew 2 (Acaba, Williams, Hoshide):Sleep – 5:30pm (last night)Wake – 2:00am (this morning, nominal) At wakeup (9:00am), Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-5 Sunita Williams had Day 4 of the pH test and diet log entry for the Pro K pH plus controlled diet menu protocol of her first (FD15) Pro K Controlled Diet activity with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording her diet input today, Suni began the urine collections for his Nutrition/Repository/Pro K 24-hour protocol and prepared the equipment for the associated blood sampling tomorrow (8/3).       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-6 Hoshide configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware with power, data, front panel, and gas connections plus MBS (Mixing Bag System), and then conducted his first session with the Sprint VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, including software & instrument calibrations, checking instruments, exercise protocol, cessation, and data downlink.  These activities were executed several times.  After the session, Akihiko powered down, cleaned up & partially stows the equipment, then downloaded the data to a PCS laptop.        [The experiment Sprint VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  Sprint VO2max is a test that measures oxygen uptake, ventilatory threshold, and other physiological parameters for evaluation of Sprint exercise prescription. The in-flight exercise protocol consists of multiple stages.  Both the VO2max and Sprint experiments require monthly max tests in-flight, but each use a different protocol to obtain the data.  Joint VO2max/Sprint subjects use the VO2max protocol.  Suni is performing the VO2max protocol, Aki the Sprint Max protocol.  Suni is the last VO2max subject.  Aki is the first Sprint subject not also participating in VO2max.  The Sprint protocol requires less Portable PFS accessory hardware than the VO2max protocol. However, for consistency, both crew will complete the full hardware setup.] FE-3 Acaba serviced the YTSL (YouTube SpaceLab) Spider Habitat, deactivating CFBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4), feeding the spider that was in camera view, closing up and reactivates CGBA. Later, Joe completed his weekly task of filling out the SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch on a daily basis and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space. FE-2 Revin executed the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) data conversion control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA (Orbiter Communications Adapter). After 48P hatch opening, Sergei used the Russian АК-1М analyzer to take air samples from the cargo ship. Sergei also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Later, FE-2 took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Maintenance System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-3 Acaba recorded a Podcast for the Vascular payload.  Vascular is a Canadian experiment studying the inner mechanisms of cardiovascular changes during long-duration space missions. Suni Williams photographed all ten BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 5) samples individually today.  These samples have been undisturbed since October 2011.      [The goal of BCAT-5 phase separation is to study how the microscopic liquid suspended particles separate from each other (like oil and water) over time.  This understanding could help extending product shelf-life on Earth and space and assist in development of next generation materials such as in computer technologies and advanced optics.] Sunita also completed her first of six sessions of Kinematics exercise on the T2 treadmill.    [However the exercise session was not video recorded and FE-5 will be re-scheduled for a modified Kinematics session tomorrow.  She is the final subject for this experiment.  This experiment will assist in determining the most beneficial treadmill exercise conditions that can be used to maintain or improve crewmember health during long-duration spaceflight.] Joe Acaba & Aki Hoshide assembled and deployed the 7 PBA (Portable Breathing Apparatus) bottles and 3 QDMAs (Quick-Don Mask Assemblies) that were delivered on HTV3.      [3 PBA bottles are expiring in September.  These will be replaced by the new units.  At the completion of this deploy there will be 23 functional PBAs onboard.]  Joe powered up the amateur/ham radio equipment in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and SM after the successful 48P docking. FE-3 & FE-6 filled out their regular FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop).  It was the 2nd for Aki, the 9th for Joe.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Before Presleep, FE-3 turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-3, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6). Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
