ISS On-Orbit Status 11/12/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway: Week 8 of Increment 33 (last week of six-person crew).   After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   FE-2 Tarelkin completed the daily reboot of the Russian RSS1 & RSS2 laptops. FE-1 Novitskiy did the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. FE-3 Ford conducted Part 1 of the periodic noise measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the Soyuz 31S crew, i.e., Yuri (#1004), Suni (#1003) & Aki (#1005), for a 24-hr data take. FE-4 Malenchenko completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~4:15pm EST.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days (last time: 10/22 & 10/23.] After Kevin Ford set up & powered on the USND (Ultrasound) with video camcorder and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), Sunita Williams & Akihiko Hoshide took turns with their final (R-7/Return minus 7 days) USND SPRINT leg scan, placing reference markers on thigh & calf of their right legs with the help of each other, donning the SPRINT thigh & calf guides and then performing the SPRINT leg scans with remote guidance from ground teams.     [SPRINT (Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study) evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise training to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in ISS crewmembers during long-duration missions.] Sitting ~2 hrs in the Soyuz TMA-05M/31S Descent Module (#706), FE-4 Malenchenko & CDR Williams conducted the nominal descent drill, a standard training exercise for every crew returning on this spacecraft. Results of the exercise, which strictly forbids any command activation (except for switching the InPU display on the Neptun-ME console), were subsequently reported to ground control at TsUP/Moscow. Undocking from MRM1 Rassvet is currently planned for 11/18 at ~5:26pm EST.     [The session includes a review of the pertinent ODFs (operational data files), specifically the books on Soyuz Ascent & Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situations, crew responsibilities when executing the flight program, visual crew recognition of SUS (Entry Control System) failures, spacesuit procedures, etc., with special emphasis on operations with the Neptune-ME cockpit console. The training uses a Descent Simulator application (Trenasher Spusk =”descent trainer”) on the RSK1 T61p laptop.] Oleg Novitskiy & Evgeny Tarelkin completed their first OOHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) tests, a 30-minute NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures and monitor crew hearing status on-orbit, using a special software application on the SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop.     [The self-administered OOHA test is a variation of conventional audiometric testing, in which the crewmember determines minimum audibility for tones, over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, in each ear.  While wearing custom-made Prophonics earphones and Bose active noise reduction headsets, the crewmember uses special EarQ software on the SSC to determine the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The first on-orbit test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per 45 days thereafter.  Results are then reviewed by medical personnel and compared to pre-flight OOHA data and also to previous on-orbit OOHA results.  Note: There have been temporary shifts in hearing sensitivity documented on some crewmembers, most of which have recovered to pre-mission levels.] Supporting the Russian BTKh-39 ASEPTIK experiment in the DC1 Docking Compartment, Evgeny took the periodic post-incubation photographs of the culture medium samples in the “Poverkhnost” (Surface) & “Vozdukh” (Air) collection devices and their stowage, later edited the images and downlinked them to Earth via RSPI high-speed data link. Suni downloaded the accumulated data from her 4th and final 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session (11/9-11/11) from two Actiwatch Spectrums and two HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1), using one of the Makita power tool batteries for the Cardiopres that Aki recharged during the day.  The laptop was then powered off.    [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] In Node-3, Williams completed the approximately weekly WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.      [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Yuri performed his 2nd session with the MBI-29 IMMUNO (Neuroendocrine & Immune Responses in Humans During & After Long Term Stay at ISS) equipment, using the SALIVA-I IMMUNO kit and the Reflotron-4 analyzer to collect saliva and venous blood samples which he then processed and cold-stored for return to Earth. A second saliva sample was taken about 11 hrs later, plus the MBI-29 stress test and filling out of the associated questionnaire. Aki completed the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus), a full fill of ~9 min duration during which WHC was not available. Later, FE-6 serviced the WRS (Water Recovery System) in Node-3, reconfiguring RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) setup by disconnecting & removing the QD (quick disconnect) with depress hose along with the tank’s vent adapter for nominal UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) processing and returning it to stowage. After installing the sampler, Malenchenko performed the periodic standard collection of KAV (condensate water) samples into empty drink bags for return to Earth on Soyuz TMA-05M/31S (11/18).     [The sample collection of condensate water from the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor in the SM before (upstream of) the FGS gas/liquid mixture filter/separator and the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit will be continued until 3 days before undocking.] Sunita Williams readied the equipment for taking measurements for the JAXA BLR48 (Biological Rhythms 48/BIORHYTHMS) experiment and then started the session with a wrist-worn Actiwatch Spectrum (#9001) with BLR48 software and the medical laptop.      [First, Suni uses Holter 1 for data recording, then swaps it with Holter 2, Multi Media memory card and fresh AAA battery after 24 hrs (and 10 min after power-up) for another 24 hrs. Objective of this study for Aki & Suni is to examine the circadian variation of astronaut’s digital electrocardiograph during space flights using the cardiac autonomic function of the “Digital Walk Holter ECG” with its electrodes attached to the chest and the wrist-worn Actiwatch Spectrum activity monitor to supplement circadian rhythms data. For Aki only, the objective is also the long-term ODK2 (Onboard Diagnostic Kit 2) evaluation of a remote healthcare system’s operability and accuracy with the collected data, in order to develop a computerized remote healthcare system for astronauts.] With STTS communications configured for work in MRM1, Novitskiy & Tarelkin conducted a 2.5hr session with the KPT-2 payload suite of BAR science instruments, today using the AU-1 Ultrasound Analyzer of the BAR instrument suite to take acoustic readings at a large number of locations in the SM RO (Work Compartment).     [KPT-2 monitors problem areas, necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life. AU-1 Ultrasound readings can be used for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization. Data are copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities are supported by ground specialist tagup as required.] Later, Evgeny completed the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]Kevin performed the periodic checkout of the four CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) instruments. Afterwards, FE-3 completed the periodic relocation of the EHS IV-TEPC (Environmental Health System Intra-Vehicular Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter), today from SM Panel 327 to Node-2 (P3), then activated it and tested communications & data transfer from the radiation instrument to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for later downlink to the ground.  TEPC Audio Alarm was disabled.  The new setup was photo-documented.    [Crew report: “Took about 50 minutes, twice the time allocated.”] In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Ford later replaced the used ACS (Atmospheric Control System) sensor module of the EMCS (European Modular Cultivation System) with a new one. Malenchenko copied accumulated GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment data from the VK2 video camcorder to the RSK1 laptop for return to Earth on HDD (hard disk drive). As handover activity, Oleg joined up with Yuri to flush the BV2 Rodnik tank of Progress M-16M/48P with disinfectant after connecting the compressor with hose, adapter and power cable to the tank and the EDV containing the disinfectant solution. Kevin Ford set up the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload components in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack and activated camera with 50mm lens & software when the ground could be seen for camera focusing. Several hours later, before sleeptime, FE-3 will swap to a fully charged battery and restart camera and EKAM software.     [For running EKAM, SSC11 (Station Support Computer 11) was relocated to LAB1D3 and switched from wired to wireless operation, using the new EarthKAM software which replaced the early version used for the KODAK DCS 760 camera.  This is the 5th use of the NIKON D2Xs camera by EKAM and the 4th time that any images will be taken from the WORF. EK will have a week-long session (until 11/17) starting with system checkout and targeting calibration. Students around the world, anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images, will begin taking their images tomorrow by remote commanding. D2Xs batteries (3 per day) need to be fully charged for camera operation.] FE-2 set up the BTKh-43 KONSTANTA payload, performed the 3rd session of the experiment and photo/video recorded it. Data were downlinked to TsUP via RSPI high-speed link.   [Using the Rekomb-K hardware, KONSTANTA aims to identify the effects of the micro-G environment on the activity of a model enzymatic agent with respect to a specific zymolyte by identifying the feasibility of determining enzymatic activity of an isolated cholinesterase specimen in comparison with ground experiments run concurrently and periodic activity tests of the cholinesterase specimen with respect to a specific zymolyte on board the ISS using a method which allows correct calculation of the Michaelis constant.  Purpose: Finding possible approaches to protecting enzyme systems of animals against undesirable effects of spaceflight, as well as determining the feasibility of both spot checks and regular monitoring of biochemical indicators of the crew during spaceflight using enzyme test systems.] Oleg took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Evgeny completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Ford & Williams had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Yuri & Aki had an hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which is standard pre-return procedure for homecoming crewmembers. Before Presleep (~2:30pm EST), Suni powers up the MPC and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Oleg Novitskiy had ~1h20m reserved for using the SONY HVR-Z7E video camera to film onboard scenes for Roskosmos TV Studio’s joint project with News Channel “Russia 24”, producing its weekly program on cosmonautics. Kevin & Aki performed maintenance on the ARED advanced resistive exercise machine, swapping the exercise rope with a spare and afterwards also replacing the two cable arm ropes with new ones.   [More rope adjustments are needed to keep the cable arms in their detents. Under study by the ground.] The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).     [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed ARED/CEVIS (cont.), with T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/T2 (cont.), T2 (int., 4 min.), none, ARED/T2 (cont.) and T2 (2 min) for the next 6 days. Aki’s protocol for today showed T2 (int., 30 sec.), with ARED/CEVIS (cont.), none, T2 (int., 4 min.), ARED/T2 (cont.), T2 (int. 2 min.) and ARED/CEVIS on the following 6 days.  Explanation: After 10 min. warmup (active, i.e., motorized): Aerobic “T2 30 sec” (passive, i.e., nonmotorized) = 7-8 sets of exercise at HRmax (max. heart rate) for 30 sec, with 15 sec rest in between.  Aerobic “T2 2 min” (motorized) = 6 sets of 2 min each at 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 90%, 80% HRmax.  Aerobic “T2 4 min” (motorized) = 4 sets of 4 min, with 3 min rest period in between. ] Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U  to record target sites on the Earth surface, andA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
