ISS On-Orbit Status 01/31/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  After wakeup this morning, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also at wakeup, FE-1 Shkaplerov completed the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. Dan Burbank, André Kuipers & Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 24th for Dan, the 17th for André and Don.  The three crewmembers are performing their RST sleep shift session starting on 1/24 and every day through 2/2.        [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Burbank configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 2nd (FD30) ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, after preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres, assisted by André Kuipers.  At ~7:55am EST, the CDR observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.         [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, André started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] Anatoly Ivanishin conducted the routine verification of yesterday’s refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.         [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the installation on 8/8 of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Anatoly also completed the periodic routine maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, changing out replaceable parts with new components, such as a filter insert (F-V), the urine receptacle (MP), the pre-treat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pre-treat & water dispenser.     [All old parts were trashed for disposal, and the IMS was updated. E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), CrO3 (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H2O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.] Oleg Kononenko performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] André Kuipers serviced the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload at the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack by swapping batteries several times during the day.     [This is the 3rd use of the NIKON D2Xs camera by EKAM and the 2nd time that any images will be taken from the WORF. Students around the world are anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images.] FE-1 Anton Shkaplerov completed his first session with the MBI-29 IMMUNO (Neuroendocrine & Immune Responses in Humans During & After Long Term Stay at ISS) equipment, using the SALIVA-I IMMUNO kit and the Plazma-03 Centrifuge to collect saliva and, with Ivanishin’s help, blood samples which were then processed in the centrifuge by Anton and stored in MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) Dewar 2, Tray B, and Tray section 3-4 by Don Pettit. CDR Burbank conducted Part 1 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the Increment 30 crew, i.e., Anatoly, Anton & himself, for a 24-hr data take. Working in the DC1 Docking Compartment on the POV EVA support panel, FE-4 Kononenko used a screwdriver to remove the clock and replace it with the clock unit from the MRM1 Rassvet POV. After gathering necessary gear and preparing the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) in Node-2 by cleaning its surface, FE-5 Kuipers removed & replaced the PAM (Photoacoustic Analyzer Module) ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) of the PFS (Pulmonary Function System) at the HRF-2 (Human Research Facility 2). FE-2 Ivanishin completed the periodic routine maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, changing out replaceable parts with new components, such as a filter insert (F-V), the urine receptacle (MP), the pre-treat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pre-treat & water dispenser;  [all old parts were trashed for disposal, and the IMS was updated. E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), CrO3 (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H2O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.] In JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Don Pettit reviewed procedures for the CFE VG1 (Capillary Flow Experiments / Vane Gap 1) experiment, then prepared the MWA WSA (Work Surface Area) and conducted  another 2-hr test session with the VG1 vessel.  The equipment was then torn down and stowed away.     [CFE has applications to the management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.  VG1 is one of three CFE experiments, the others being ICF (Interior Corner Flow) and CL (Contact Line).  Each of the CFE experiments is represented with two unique experimental units (1,2), all of which use similar fluid-injection hardware, have simple and similarly sized test chambers, and rely solely on video for highly quantitative data.  Silicone oil is the fluid used for all the tests, with different viscosities depending on the unit.  Differences between units are primarily fluid properties, wetting conditions, and test cell cross section.]   Anatoly completed the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWC (Collapsible Water Container) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV will be connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.     [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.] In preparation for the Russian EVA-30 on 2/16, Kononenko checked out the Orlan-MK POV support stations in the SM PkhO Transfer Compartment and DC1 module. Anton Shkaplerov worked in the newly-arrived Progress 46P vehicle to install the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory), using the LKT and PZU boxes removed from a previous Progress and stowed in DC1 (Docking Compartment). Burbank performed his 4th session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] André deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.      [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] FE-2 downloaded the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.     [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] FE-1 & FE-4 spent several hours unloading Progress 46P and transferring its cargo to the ISS while logging moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System). FE-5 started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.        [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] Later, FE-5 collected air samples with new GSCs (Grab Sample Containers) in the SM, Lab and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), sequenced with the AQM sampling for postflight comparison. André also used the two CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-O2) units #1043 & #1048 to take oxygen partial pressure readings in the SM and COL. CDR Burbank configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 2nd (FD30) session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, after preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres, assisted by André.  At ~7:55am EST, the CDR observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.        [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] Kuipers conducted the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.       [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Shkaplerov unpacked & deployed new 46P-arrived RODF (Russian Operations Data Files) documents, updating onboard procedures books. After familiarizing himself with procedures, Oleg started another windows inspection in the RS.         [Objective of the inspection, which uses a digital still camera (Nikon D2X w/SB-28DX flash) and voice recorder, is to assess the pane surfaces on RS for any changes (new cavities, scratches, new or expanded old stains or discolorations affecting transparency properties) since the last inspection.  The new assessment will be compared to the earlier observations.  Defects are measured with the parallax method which uses eyeball-sighting with a ruler and a right isosceles triangle to determine the defects' size and position with respect to the window's internal surface (parallax being the apparent change in an object's position resulting from changing the observer's position).] In the Kibo JPM, Dan Burbank worked ~1h 40m on readying & starting the new BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) experiment, using the setup configured by Mike Fossum.  Kuipers provided support by taking documentary photography.  Before “Presleep” period tonight, Dan will replace the BCAT-6 battery with a fresh one.        [Activities included installing the G1 high-resolution camcorder for MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) video capture, unstowing the SGSM (Slow Growth Sample Module) and photographing samples 1-10 manually with the NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC (Station Support Computer).  After arranging the lighting for the turbid sample, Dan homogenized (mixed) Sample 1 and then set up the latter for automated flash photography controlled by EarthKAM software.  The new EK software photographs Sample 1 once every two hours for seven days, and Burbank performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.] FE-4 performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-2 took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Working on the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System 2) in Node-3, Dan Burbank removed the brine-filled ARFTA #2 (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly 1), drained it with the Russian Kompressor-M into an EDV-U container and replaced it with ARFTA #1 in WRS-2.     [The recycle tank was then to be filled via the refill method using the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) quick-disconnect depress hose which was later removed again, along with the tank’s vent adapter.]  In the Lab (loc. O4), Don powered up the GLACIER-2 (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator 2) freezer in ER-6 (EXPRESS Rack 6). Shkaplerov started his 3rd session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2-2 protocol which monitors human cardiovascular performance in the space flight environment.        [After 24 hrs of ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed (CDM) system, Anton will doff the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads and recorded on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results will then be downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data will be downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] Ivanishin conducted another 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Eastern Pacific, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. Dan performed his 4th session with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.       [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.] Both Burbank & Kuipers completed their (currently) daily electronic logging of diet for the High Salt Diet protocol of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included), the crewmember is ingesting one of two special diets (low salt & high salt content).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.  SOLO was also part of the experiments done on the recent Russian Mars500 long-duration flight simulation.] Burbank & Pettit had another time slot reserved for making entries in their electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 & FE-5 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, André at ~6:15 am, Anton at ~10:00am, Oleg at ~12:45pm, Anatoly at ~1:05pm EST. At ~11:50am EST, Burbank & Pettit joined up to support a PAO TV event from the Kibo lab, talking with students at Asa Low Intermediate School in Mansfield, TX. Before his workout on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), the CDR evacuated its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration.       [The cylinders always have a very minute leak.  If air is not removed from them, ARED loads will not be true to scale.  After a complete cylinder evacuation, ARED loads can feel significantly higher.] The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-2, FE-4).  After his T2 session, Burbank closed down the T2 software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display. Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan will turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Plaque Hanging:   At 2:40pm, the traditional official plaque hanging took place in ISS Mission Control/Houston for the Inc-29 Plaque with crew participation.
