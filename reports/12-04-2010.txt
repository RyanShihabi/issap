ISS On-Orbit Status 12/04/10 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday --- Crew rest day. At day’s begin, FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will again inspect the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] Also at wake-up, CDR Kelly performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift (therefore, for the next sleep shift sequence RST is scheduled twice daily.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Kelly, Skripochka & Kaleri completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of the uborka house cleaning, Alex & Oleg conducted regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille and Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM (Service Module). Alex Kaleri completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-1 also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for reporting to TsUP. and cleaning its pre-filter with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment. At ~9:00am EST, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. Kelly filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~1:30pm EST, Scott is scheduled for his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.] Weekly Science Update (Expedition Twenty-Six -- Week 1). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):    No report. 3D SPACE:    No report.

The objective of this study is to determine how human endothelial cells modify their behavior when exposed to microgravity.  Endothelial cells line the interior surface of blood vessels.  They line the entire circulartory system, from the heart to the smallest capillary.  Endothelial cells are involved in many aspects of vascular biology, including atherosclerosis, blood clotting (thrombosis & fibrinolysis), vasoconstriction and vasodilation, and hence the control of blood pressure.

As for Increment 25, which concluded on 11/25, we have received a total of 7,717 CEO frames for review and cataloging.  We are pleased to report your acquisition of the following targets with times corresponding to those of our daily CEO Target Request lists:  Castries, Santa Lucia – target was acquired, but more clouds were present than expected – requests will continue; Volcan Colima – good detailed views – under evaluation for completion of requirements; and Baghdad, Iraq – several context views acquired – under evaluation for completeness.  As imagery requirements are met for our targets we are able to remove them from your Increment request lists.” CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded today were Beirut, Lebanon (nadir pass.  The city occupies a major promontory on the coastline), Damascus, Syria (Damascus, at nadir, lies on the inland side of the mountains of Lebanon, within the largest green patch of irrigated agricultural land), Banjul, The Gambia (West Africa pass:  Looking right for this and the next two capital cities.  All have visual cues to assist locating them), Bissau, Guinea-Bissau (looking right of track on the coast), and Conakry, Guinea (looking right of track on the coast).
