ISS On-Orbit Status 07/10/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After breakfast, FE-2 Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-3 Acaba completed his weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, his 20th time.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Joe also serviced the running EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack, replacing D2Xs camera batteries several times during the day.      [For running EKAM, SSC11 (Station Support Computer 11) was switched from wired to wireless operation, using the new EarthKAM software which replaced the early version used for the KODAK DCS 760 camera.  This is the 4th use of the NIKON D2Xs camera by EKAM and the 3rd time that any images will be taken from the WORF.  EK has a week-long session starting with system checkout and targeting calibration.  Students around the world, anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images, began their image taking today by remote commanding (121 schools/groups were already signed up to participate).  D2Xs batteries (3 per day) need to be fully charged for camera operation.  Also, Joe will change the lens tomorrow (7/11), and students/teachers will capture images until EK deactivation on 7/14 (Saturday).] The three crewmembers joined up for the standard 3-hr Soyuz Emergency Descent Drill, a regular procedure for each station crew.  The exercise, which does not involve any command activation, uses computer simulation (Trenasher Spusk/”descent trainer”) on the RSK1-T61p laptop, with a descent hand controller (RUS) in manual mode to set up reentry conditions and switch between modes.  Operators were Gennady & Sergei, each performing 3 runs, with max-g and deviation results logged.     [The OBT (onboard training) session, supported by TsUP instructor tagup, included a review of the pertinent RODF (Russian Operations Data Files), specifically the books on Soyuz Insertion & Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situation Procedures such as manual undocking.] The CDR worked in the ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3), removing the failed cabin fan and replacing it with a new spare.  After the fan cover and ducts were replaced and all connections remated, Gennady also performed the standard cleaning on the fan/duct assembly.       [The R&R used the only spare fan available.  ESA has suggested that the remaining O2 be transferred as soon as possible while the fan is working.  The failed fan will be returned to the ground as soon as possible since the same failure has been seen on the two previous 2 ATVs.] Sergei Revin went looking for a specific BVS onboard computer system SD memory card for subsequent transfer of a new update file on an available computer to a USB-flash mass memory device and from there to the SD-card. Joe Acaba started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.       [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] Afterwards, FE-3 re-installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) at Lab starboard bay S3, engaged the snubber pins and locked safety pins to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances). FE-2 spent another ~2h on transferring & loading discarded cargo on Progress 47P for disposal while logging moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System) database. Gennady completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] As part of SOZh, Padalka also ran tests on the Vozdukh SOA (Atmosphere Purification System)’s vacuum pump to troubleshoot the recent shutdown of the CO2 removal system when the vacuum pump failed.       [With the vacuum pump activated, the CDR switched through the three BVK vacuum valves, checking on LED (Light Emitting Diode) status, noise and duration of vacuum pump operation.  While the Vozdukh CO2 scrubber is out, the Lab CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) is removing CO2 from the stack.  Should it fail, the plan is to activate the Node-3 CDRA (which has the known valve issue and is “suspect”).  Assuming that the Lab CDRA remains working, ppCO2 (partial pressure CO2) should remain at 2.0 mmHg with three crewmembers while TsUP-Moscow is troubleshooting.] Revin meanwhile took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Acaba serviced the FPEF MI (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility / Marangoni Inside) payload in the JAXA Kibo laboratory by removing & replacing 5 HDs (hard disks) of the IPU VRU (Image Processing Unit / Video Recording Unit),- #1042, #1043, #1044, #1045, #1046.      [The replaced VRU disks (#2, #3, #4, #5, #6) were temporarily stowed in a Ziploc bag.] Afterwards, Joe retrieved from stowage & gathered CMS (Crew Medical Systems) physical exercise gear for the upcoming Soyuz 31S crew, Malenchenko, Williams & Hoshide. In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Joe prepared for the arrival of the HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3) by cycling the manual PROX/Proximity Communication System in the ICS (Inter-Satellite Communication System) Rack at loc. O4 on/off (activating/deactivating) and verifying proper connection of the HCP (HTV Control Panel) by switching the panel to Enable, then to Disable. CDR Padalka had ~30 min set aside for the periodic inspection and photography of RS (Russian Segment) windows, today focusing on SM windows #02, #13, #14 and a review of the pertinent RODF (Russian Operations Data File).        [Objective of the inspection, which uses a digital still camera (Nikon D2X w/SB-28DX flash) and voice recorder, is to assess the pane surfaces on RS for any changes (new cavities, scratches, new or expanded old stains or discolorations affecting transparency properties) since the last inspection.  The new assessment will be compared to the earlier observations.  Defects are measured with the parallax method which uses eyeball-sighting with a ruler and a right isosceles triangle to determine the defects' size and position with respect to the window's internal surface (parallax being the apparent change in an object's position resulting from changing the observer's position).] Afterwards, Gennady broke out and set up the equipment for the MBI-29 IMMUNO (Neuroendocrine & Immune Responses in Humans During & After Long Term Stay at ISS) experiment, consisting of the Plazma-03 consumables kit, the SALIVA-I IMMUNO kit and the Plazma-03 Centrifuge.       [MBI-29 is scheduled tomorrow for Padalka, assisted by Revin.] Sergei performed the periodic service data dump from the BSPN Payload Server via high-speed RSPI Data Transmission Radio Link with the RSS1 laptop, Acaba & Padalka joined up for an inspection of the ARED exercise rope which has exceeded its “certified life”.      [For the inspection, one crewmember pulled out the rope to its hard stop while the other crewmember took measurements and documentary photographs, looking for fraying/damage.  Until the inspection has been performed and the ground has assessed the photos, ARED was No Go for exercises using the cable (bar exercise is permissible).  New ARED ropes will arrive on Soyuz 31S.] Acaba again had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Before Presleep, FE-3 will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~11:05am, Joe powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 11:15am conducted a ham radio session with high school juniors participating in a summer program called WISH, for “Women in STEM High School Aerospace Scholars”.       [The students are selected from responses to a national invitation to attend multiple robust lessons for six days at NASA/JSC.  The young women attend briefings and engage in competitive hands-on engineering activities related to space exploration and research.] At ~2:15pm EDT, Sergei & Gennady supported a Russian PAO TV event, extending greetings for Paratroopers Day (VDV), with special wishes to Colonel-General Vladimir A. Shamanov, troop commander and Hero of Russia.     [Russia celebrates Airborne Troops Day on 8/2.] CDR & FE-2 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Sergei at ~2:30pm, Gennady at ~2:45pm EDT. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).  Tasks listed for Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,Earth photography of current flooding conditions in the Russian Kuban region, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). FGB Refueling:   Starting tonight around midnight, propellants will be transferred by ground command from the Progress 47P tanks via the DC1 Docking Compartment to the FGB long high-pressure fuel and oxidizer tanks (BVDG for the UDMH fuel, & BVDO for the NTO oxidizer). KLG2V & EKTS Tests:   Also via ground commanding, tests are being performed over RGS (Russian Groundsite) on the KLG2V and EKTS Unified Command & Telemetry System, with BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and VD-SU control mode switched off.      [With BITS2-12 and VD-SU turned off for the testing, the following equipment is deactivated to avoid operation in the absence of real-time telemetry:  1. Elektron (shutdown by crew or ground).  2. SKV air conditioning system (shutdown by crew or ground).  3. Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal unit (no telemetry if in automatic mode, no impact if in manual mode).  4. BMP micropurification unit (automatic shutdown).  5. SRV-K condensate water processor (can be shut down by crew or ground, usually not required).  6. BRI data conversion unit (smart router) is power cycled when VD-SU mode is cycled.   7. Due to the lack of telemetry, there is no dP/dt (pressure drop) detection in the RS (Russian Segment).  8. Fire & smoke alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the PSS (Caution & Warning) panel speaker.  9. Total pressure alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the PSS speaker.] CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were San Marino, San Marino (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  ISS had a near nadir pass in fair weather over the tiny capital city of this microstate within the target area with its approach from the SW.  At this time as it approached the coast of northern Italy, the crew was to begin a mapping strip to acquire useful views that they probably were not able to distinguish for themselves.  The Republic itself is land-locked and is located about 20 miles SW of the Italian coastal city of Rimini.  Best visual cues are Rimini's small but prominent bay and a light-toned river which reaches the sea at this point), Pristina, Kosovo (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  The capital and largest city of Kosovo has an estimated population approaching 600,000.  Pristina in located near the eastern edge of an agricultural region known as the Kosovo Plain which runs N-S through the interior of the Balkan Peninsula in southeastern Europe.  ISS had a nadir pass in clear weather and early afternoon light.  At this time, as it tracked southeastward across the Balkan interior, the crew was to begin looking for single-frame views of this target), Damascus, Syria (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  The Syrian capital with a population estimated at 1.8 million is located in the extreme southwestern part of the country on an arid plateau area about 50 miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea.  The nadir pass was mid-afternoon with clear weather expected.  At this time, the crew began looking for this low-contrast urban area on the western edge of an area of intensive agriculture, trying to capture the entire area in a single frame), Kellogg Biological Station, Michigan (LONG TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH SITE [LTER]:  CEO objective for these sites is to document land cover and land use change on a seasonal basis.  Requested was the 400 mm lens to differentiate boundaries between land cover and coastal biomes.  The Kellogg site is located in SW Michigan in the eastern portion of the U.S. Corn Belt, 50 km east of Lake Michigan.  Today’s fair-weather, mid-morning pass tracks northeastward just S and E of Lake Michigan.  At this time, as ISS passed near, the crew was to look nadir and try for a detailed mapping strip across the target area), Fraser River Flooding, BC, Canada (DYNAMIC EVENT:  This request is in response to an International Charter activation for flooding on the Fraser River in British Colombia dated 06/24/12.  Weather has finally improved enough for views of this region along the lower Fraser River valley where the worst flooding was reported.  ISS had a late-morning pass in fair weather with the area of interest to the right of track.  At this time as ISS began tracking over northwestern Vancouver Island, the crew was to look right of track, first for sediment plumes in the Straits of Georgia, and then try for a mapping strip along the course of the Fraser River inland from the city of Vancouver), and West Hawk Impact Crater, Manitoba (ISS had a nadir pass in fair weather at midday over this target area with its approach from the WNW.  West Hawk Lake, which fills the impact structure, is about 100 miles east of Winnipeg, Manitoba and 50 miles north of Lake of the Woods on the US/Canadian border.  This 4.5 km-diameter crater was formed 350 million years ago.  Despite several episodes of glacial erosion in the last 2 million years, it is still evident in the landscape.  At this time as ISS tracked just over the city of Winnipeg, the crew was to begin an overlapping mapping strip to try and acquire this small feature).
