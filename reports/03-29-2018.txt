USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #49: Today Drew Feustel (as EV-1) and Ricky Arnold (as EV-2) exited the Joint Airlock at 8:30am CDT to perform US EVA #49.  Egress was delayed for about 1.5 hours due to issues with suit leak checks that were ultimately cleared.  The primary goal of today’s EVA was to install the Node 3 External Wireless Communications (EWC) Antennas and associated cables, Remove and Replace (R&R) the Camera Port (CP)-8 External Television Camera Group, and retrieve the Port 1 Radiator Beam Valve Module (RBVM) Flex Hose Jumpers. All of the prime tasks were completed and the CP8 functions, including External High Definition Camera, were successfully checked out.  The N3 EWC system will be checked out at a later date after the internal components are installed.  The crew was also able to conduct Pump/Flow Control Subassembly (PFCS) Jumper Set up in preparation for a future USOS PFCS Relocate EVA and perform preparatory tasks on the Pump Module stowed on External Stowage Platform (EXP)-2. The Phased Elapsed Time (PET) for the EVA was 6:10. 
Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Operations:  Ground robotic specialists have started to walkoff the SSRMS from the Mobile Base System (MBS) to the N2 Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF) in prep for Offset Grapples training for Dragon. Following the SSRMS walkoff ground specialists will perform a MT translation from worksite 6 to worksite 4.
