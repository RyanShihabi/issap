ISS On-Orbit Status 08/02/11    All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FE-3 Ron Garan is on Day 6 of his current SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment run.  Today’s activities involved taking measurements of body mass (BMM) with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device), final urine sampling after the 24-hr collections, and securing his blood samples in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Special diet intake & logging was not required.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included), the crewmember is ingesting one of two special diets (low salt & high salt content).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]   After yesterday’s successful suited dry-run for the Russian EVA-29, CDR Borisenko, FE-1 Samokutyayev & FE-4 Volkov spent several hours on preparing for the EVA tomorrow, first reviewing the spacewalk timeline for about 2 hrs, then completing EVA equipment gathering, filling & installing Orlan drink bags, etc. Outer hatch opening & egress by Volkov (EV1) & Samokutyayev (EV2) is scheduled for ~10:30am EDT, ingress & hatch closure at ~4:27pm, for an estimated duration of 5 hrs 57 min.  Spacewalk objectives are:   ·         Deploying & photographing the Radioskaf  microsatellite,  ·         Installing the BTLS-N (Onboard Laser Communications Terminal) monoblock and mating it on the SM RO lg. (Service Module Work Compartment, large diam.), ·         Removing the 4[AO-VKA] antenna unit on the SM RO sm. (small diam.), ·         Photographing the WAL6 antenna of the PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment) antenna feeder unit on SM RO sm., ·         Relocating the massive Strela-1 cargo boom assembly from DC1 Docking Compartment to the MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2),  ·         Installing the Biorisk-[MSN] platform with three containers on DC1,  ·         Photographing the SKK #1 materials exposure container on MRM2 and the Komplast panel #11 on FGB, and ·         Photographing pictures of Gagarin, Korolev and Tsiolkovski.   Preparatory to the EVA, Aleksandr Samokutyayev –  Set up      the BIO-2V BIORISK-MSN      container by opening its respiratory vents and taking documentary      photography, and Configured      EVA radiation dosimeters by collecting PILLE      dosimeters A0307, A0309 & A0310 from their exposure locations (DC1,      Node-3, SM) for data reading and locating two of them in the left leg      pockets of Sasha’s & Sergei’s Orlans, then securing two ID-Z individual      dosimeters in the inner liner breast pockets of their spacesuits.     Ron Garan, who will be isolated in the MRM2 Poisk module during the EVA-29 for contingency access to Soyuz 26S, conducted a 2-hr crew handover session with Mike Fossum to bring the latter up to date on activities status.   In MRM2, Andrey Borisenko reconnected the +Y Kurs-P AFU (Antenna Feeder Unit) to the K2-VKA antenna instrumentation unit in the SM.     [The Kurs-P cables had been mated incorrectly on 7/28, as shown by photo analysis.  Kurs is the automated radar approach & docking system on the Russian Soyuz & Progress vehicles, with the active (Kurs-A) component in the visiting vehicles and the passive transponder/repeater-type Kurs-P component in the SM.]   In the Lab, FE-6 Fossum removed the 4 alignment guides from FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack) to allow the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be activated before begin of ground-commanded FIR operations requiring a microgravity environment.  Before sleeptime, FE-6 will re-install the guides for protection.   Afterwards, Fossum prepared the SHERE (Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment) payload equipment for a new series of sample runs.       [Mike’s activities included activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) from its laptop, setting up the video camera for over-the-shoulder real-time coverage, configuring the SHERE equipment in the MSG WV (Work Volume), powering on the hardware, and loading SHERE with its payload software application from the MSG laptop, then testing the SHERE Laser Micrometer and the SHERE Force Transducer, transferring the acquired data for downlink and powering down the hardware, incl. MSG, and closing out the experiment.    Background:  Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of an applied stress (“preshearing” = rotation) which might be, for example, a shear stress or extensional stress.  In practice, rheology is principally concerned with extending the "classical" disciplines of elasticity and (Newtonian) fluid mechanics to materials whose mechanical behavior cannot be described with the classical theories.  SHERE is designed to study the effect of preshear (rotation) on the transient evolution of the microstructure and viscoelastic tensile stresses for solutions with long chains of monodisperse dilute polymer molecules in the MSG.  Collectively referred to as “Boger fluids,” these polymer solutions have become a popular choice for rheological studies of non-Newtonian fluids and are the non-Newtonian fluid used in this experiment.  The SHERE hardware consists of the Rheometer, Camera Arm, Interface Box, Cabling, Keyboard, Tool Box, Fluid Modules, and Stowage Tray.]   FE-5 Furukawa set up the G1 video camcorder and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), gathered the necessary equipment, then conducted the JAXA “Try Zero-G” demo experiment, with Ron Garan taking photography.  Later, the video was downlinked via MPC.   Satoshi also retrieved the new HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) USB adapter which arrived on ULF-7, and installed it in an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop.  This allows downloading HRM data of all crewmembers to the SSC instead of the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [It is expected that downloads occur once per week as part of the crew’s exercise time.]   Afterwards, FE-5 deactivated the ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts) Shield, terminating its radiation dosimetry collection.  Before sleeptime tonight, ALTEA Shield will be powered up again.   Ron & Satoshi joined up for Day 2 of the JEMRMS SFA (Japan Experiment Module Robotic Manipulator System / Small Fine Arm) functional checkout.  With MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder set up to transmit monitor views, FE-5 & FE-3 activated RLT (Robotics Laptop), CCP (Camera Control Panel) and RMS Monitors, tagged up with ground specialists (at ~6:55am EDT) and then went through today’s checkout maneuvers.      [Steps included configuring proper switch settings, activating & starting the JEMRMS ABM (Arm Bus Monitor), maneuvering MA (Main Arm) from stowed position to SFA backoff (Unloaded Hover), grappling the SFA grapple fixture for a checkout of the RMS EE (End Effector) and SPEE (Special Purpose EE), performing SFA grappling, activating the SFA heater via MA, ungrappling SSE (SFA Stowage Equipment) tool fixture, monitoring unberthing SFA (by ground) and maneuvering the RMS MA with the SFA to the Loaded Hover position at SSE for extracting the SFA from SSE.  All equipment was then powered down by Satoshi.  Full SFA function checkout is scheduled on 8/4, and installation of the SFA in the SSE on 8/5.]   For tomorrow’s EVA-29, Mike Fossum double checked proper jumper and power connections of the REBAs (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assemblies) powering the U.S. WVS (Wireless Video System) units on the Russian Orlan-MK spacesuits.     [Sasha’s REBA was swapped with #1009.]   Later, FE-6 reconfigured the HRF (Human Research Facility) Rack 1 from the drawer removal for the last HRF Ultrasound session to the nominal (verified) configuration.   Afterwards, Mike located & installed the grounding strap on the ER-8 ARIS (EXPRESS Rack 8 / Active Rack Isolation System) which had been moved from the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) to the Lab.   Fossum also configured the equipment for his next 24-hour urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol, starting tomorrow.  For storing the samples in MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1), Mike verified that Dewar 2 contained the necessary collection tubes (21 in four mesh bags).       [Based on crew feedback, advanced cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood & urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]   With its FSS battery freshly charged overnight, Andrey used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 during a one-hour segment, taking pictures of targets along the flight track, including North & South America, water & coastal areas of the Pacific Ocean, typical natural areas (lakes, rivers, agricultural lands, etc.), and water & coastal areas of the Atlantic Ocean.        [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.]   Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]   Sergey also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).   CDR, FE-3 & FE-6 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Andrey at ~1:00pm, Mike at ~1:20pm & Ron at ~2:45pm EDT.  In addition, FE-1 & FE-4 had their pre-EVA PMCs via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Sergei at ~12:00pm, Sasha at ~12:15pm.   At ~3:10pm, the six crewmembers will convene for their standard bi-weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office, via S-band S/G-2 audio & phone patch.   Before “Presleep” period tonight, Garan powers on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter)and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]   The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-1).   CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Rome, Italy (“The Eternal City” and capital of Italy [population ~2.7 million] lies just inland from sea on the western coastline of the Italian peninsula.  As ISS tracked southeastward on this early morning pass in mid-morning light, the crew was to look just right of track for a context view of the Rome metropolitan), Dodoma, Tanzania (ISS approach to this target today was from the NW in late morning with fair weather expected.  ISS had a nadir pass over the Tanzanian capital city with a population of 325,000.  Best visual cues were Lake Sulunga to the west and dark hills around the urban area.  Trying to capture this city in a single frame), Kwanza Basin (ISS approached this target in late morning with light and fair weather.  As it tracked near the coast at this time, the crew was to look near nadir to document a thin string of new developments [infrastructure such as main roads, power lines, and settlements along the roads] between the capital city, Luanda, and new oilfields inland.  If the crew shot overlapping images right of track for ~45 secs they will have acquired images of these new developments.  Few usable images have yet been acquired, mainly due to the presence of continuous equatorial cloud), Konza Prairie, Kansas (ISS had a mid-morning pass in clear weather for this broad, indistinct target located in the eastern Kansas region.  The Konza Prairie is one of the LTER [Long Term Ecological Research] sites.  This target is located in the Flint Hills of northeastern Kansas.  The vegetation is primarily native tall grass prairie.  ISS CEO imagery will help in the study of the effects of fire, grazing and climate variability as well as help to document the grassland ecosystems.  Overlapping frames in a mapping pass were requested.  Looking near nadir with a short lens setting), and Florida Coastal Everglades (this is an LTER Site located in the Everglades of south Florida.  Ongoing research is focused on understanding the ecosystems along the major drainage basins of the region known as “sloughs” where fresh water from the interior moves slowly to the sea.  On today’s fair-weather mid-morning pass ISS approached the target area from the NW near nadir.  Trying for short-lens contextual views of the south Florida peninsula).
