ISS On-Orbit Status 03/30/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   In ESA’s COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), CDR Burbank configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware plus MBS (Mixing Bag System), including calibrating the PPFS software and checking instruments, and then conducted his 5th session with the VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, integrated with Thermolab (head sensors).  After the session, Dan powered down, cleaned up & stowed the equipment after an hour of dry-out, and downloaded the data to a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop.       [The experiment VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.] FE-5 Kuipers conducted his 2nd session with the U.S. HMS VIS (Health Maintenance Systems / Visual Acuity) testing program which uses an eye chart for both far & near visual acuity and an eye questionnaire (DCT/Data Collection Tool), to be filled out with test data and downloaded on a laptop for ground access. Afterwards, guided by an uplinked itemized list, André gathered & labeled (with pink ribbons) US trash for disposal on Progress 46P, temporarily stowing it in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) endcone. After performing visual inspection of the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility and activating it, Don Pettit set up the G1 video camcorder and performed his first session of BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids) pyrometry experiments, running the flame tests three times with different samples.  After the operations MSG was powered down.         [BASS uses SLICE (Structure & Liftoff In Combustion Experiment) equipment but burns solid fuel samples instead of gaseous jets.  Each sample will be ignited several times for study.  Today’s steps included fan calibration before the operations to evaluate the air flow with a new fan flow constrictor, installed by Don on 3/26.  Between flame tests, Don exchanged samples plus burner tube and changed still camera setup.  Purpose of today’s initial run: to determine camera settings for future tests.  PI (Principal Investigator) stood by to assist with the burn and extinction of the flame.  At the end, Pettit exchanged digital tapes in the MSG VTRs (Video Tape Recorders) 1 & 2.] FE-2 Ivanishin completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-1 Shkaplerov took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance as part of the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-4 Kononenko terminated the air scrubbing of the opened ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) cargo ship by powering off the Russian POTOK Air Purification Unit of the SOGS Air Revitalization Subsystem which he had turned on yesterday after hatch opening. Later, André Kuipers ingressed the ATV to remove POTOK and the scrubber curtain, returning POTOK to the SM for installation and re-activation, then outfitted ATV with gas masks, fire extinguisher, air exchange duct, cabin fan acoustic covers, and handrails.  Dan Burbank took photo/video imagery during these procedures. André also deployed the procedural SODF (Station Operations Data File) for ATV, and later restowed the US equipment used for ATV docking and ingress. Anton Shkaplerov continued his work in the SM to disassemble & remove the electronic PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) used for the ATV-3 rendezvous & docking, then cleaned up and returned the removed SM panels to their initial configuration.       [Deinstallation of PCE gear & its stowage in FGB involved the PCE Z0000 Box, BUAP Antenna Switch Control Unit and ATV PU (Control Panel) in the SM plus cabling, with all connectors securely capped.]  FE-1 also took 4-5 photos of the docking cone of the passive docking assembly (ASP-B) of the SM aft port occupied by ATV-3 “Edoardo Amaldi”, a standard practice after Russian dockings.  These images are used to refine current understanding of docking conditions.  Anton subsequently downlinked the pictures via OCA assets.     [The objective is to take photo imagery of the scratch or scuff marks left by the head of the docking probe on the internal surface of the drogue (docking cone, ASP) ring, now rotated out of the passageway.  Before shooting the picture, the cosmonaut highlights the scuffmark with a marker and writes the date next to it.  As other crewmembers before him, Anton used the Nikon D2X digital still camera to take the pictures with the hatch partially closed.] Oleg Kononenko performed electronic outfitting in the SM, installing EKTS (Integrated Command & Telemetry System) feeder equipment and cables, connecting to the MBRL/PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment).     [The EKTS BKF(S) Monitoring & Filtering Unit and cabling were installed behind SM panels 225, 228, 329.] Later, Kononenko used the standard ECOSFERA equipment for Stage 2 of the microbial air sampling run for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment, started yesterday, taking samples from ATV cabin surfaces.  The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container at +37 deg.      [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge, the sample collection is being performed in two stages.  After yesterday’s sampling, the ECOSFERA battery pack was recharged overnight for today’s Stage 2 for sampling to more Petri dishes.] Burbank downloaded the accumulated data from his recent 4th (FD135) 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session from two Actiwatch Spectrums and two HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1).  The laptop was then powered off.      [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] Ivanishin used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 and the overnight freshly charged FSS photo spectrograph battery, taking pictures of targets along the flight track during a 30-minute segment, covering Atlantic Ocean water & coastal areas and Africa (Western Sahara, Mauritania, Mali, Côte d'Ivoire).       [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] Later, Shkaplerov set up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM window #9 for another 2h 30m sun-glint observation session, using the bracket-mounted spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor) for unattended ops, synchronized with the coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloaded the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.         [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.] Oleg Kononenko took the (approx.) monthly O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, his 3rd, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.        [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There has been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.] Anatoly Ivanishin configured the Rodnik (“spring”) pumping equipment with the electric compressor (#41) and the usual A-R water transfer hose to empty the remaining water (~56 L) from the Progress 46P Rodnik BV2 tank into 3 EDV-RP containers (#945, #952, #1041) in the DC-1, then replaced the hose with a T2PrU air line and started the standard bladder compression & leak check of the BV2 water tank of 46P to get it ready for urine transfer.      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.] Anatoly also had 2h 15m reserved for another round of filming more “Chronicle” newsreel footage during André’s ATV ingress & outfitting, using the SONY camcorder, part of the ongoing effort to create a “Life on the Station” photo & video documentary database on the flight of ISS-30 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] Deferred from yesterday, Kuipers retrieved a CD (compact disk) for the upcoming ESA Cycle 13 software upgrade, plus 2 preconditioned T61p laptops from stowage and stowed them temporarily in COL (loc. D4). André also conducted his weekly task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space. FE-6 Pettit supported ground-commanded activation of the EDR (European Drawer Rack) in COL (loc. F1) by COL-CC (Control Center/Oberpfaffenhofen) by configuring the ISPR (International Standard Payload Rack)’s ESEM (Exchangeable Standard Electronic Module) Board for power-up.       [Main power is delivered by PDU-2 (Power Distribution Unit 2), fed by Node-2 DDCU (DC-to-DC Converter Unit) buses 2A & 3A).] Later, Don continued the troubleshooting on the Kobairo rack in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), starting the G1 video camera and the Scopemeter instrument (without trigger setting) for voltage measurements on the GHF CE (Gradient Heating Furnace Control Equipment), with ground specialists monitoring voltage fluctuations via G1, and then restarting the Scopemeter (with trigger setting), leaving it on as is until next week and closing out the video camera. Before Presleep, Burbank turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, the CDR turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~4:45am EDT, Anton & Anatoly linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~5:00am, Ivanishin, Shkaplerov & Kononenko held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~8:40am, Dan & Don supported a PAO TV event, responding to interview questions from WNYW-TV in New York, NY (Greg Kelly, Rosanna Scotto). At ~10:00am, Dan Burbank had his regular weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- & Ku-band audio/video. At ~11:00am, the CDR held his the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists. At ~2:30pm, all six crewmembers are scheduled for a 15-min Post-ATV Arrival Additional Emergency Steps Drill, supported by specialist tagup via S-band.     [Objectives of the OBT (Onboard Training) are to familiarize everyone with the location of ATV hardware to be used in emergencies, and to review the main features of ATV emergency response.  Focus is on leak isolation, fire in ATV and setting maximum power consumption mode.] At ~4:20pm, the crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).       [FE-6 is on the special experimental PRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL. Tomorrow’s exercise starts off with ARED+T2, followed by CEVIS, ARED+T2, T2, ARED+CEVIS (VO2max) & CEVIS in the next 5 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the volcanoes Hierro, Cordon-Kaul, Hudson & Kilauea volcano, Darwin Island, and the glaciers of Patagonia;·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). WRM Update:     A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (29-0008Q) lists 19 CWCs (301.0 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (3 CWCs with 125.9 L, for Elektron electrolysis, plus 1 empty bag, all containing Wautersia bacteria;  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (7 CWCs with 121.8 L;  4. Waste water (1 bag with 10.6 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush). Also one leaky “Do-not-use” CWC (#1024) with 8.5L).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire (World Capitals Collection Site: ISS had a morning pass in partly cloudy weather over this capital city of about a quarter of a million.  It is located in the south-central part of the country, just SE of the large man-made Lake Kossou on the Bandama River.  At this time, as ISS approached from the NW, the crew was to look right of track for single-frame views of the city), Colombo, Sri Lanka (Night Target: As ISS tracked NE over the Indian Ocean and towards India, the crew was to look nadir for the capital city of Sri Lanka.  The population of the metro area is approximately 5.7 million.  Trying to acquire night images of this city to update CEO records), and Chiloe Island, southern Chile (HMS Beagle Site: ISS had a mid-day pass with fair weather expected.  At this time, looking nadir for this large, rugged and forested island as ISS approached the southern coast of Chile from the NW. Trying for context views of the island as a whole.  Darwin and the Beagle arrived at this island on June 12, 1834, surveyed the west coast, gathered provisions and left the next day).
