FemtoSat Assembly and Deployment: Using onboard components printed from the Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF)-Manufacturing Device, today the crew demonstrated FemtoSat deployment trajectories. This experiment consists of a 3D printed deployer, four FemtoSats and a 0.050” L-wrench. The four FemtoSats will be loaded in the deployer and locked in place with the L-wrench.  When the L-wrench is removed the satellites will spring launch out of the deployer. This investigation tests the design of a Femtosat deployment in microgravity prior to a full scale mission where hundreds will be deployed from a satellite. The AMF enables the production of components on the International Space Station (ISS) for both NASA and commercial objectives. The AMF is capable of producing parts out of a wide variety of thermopolymers including engineered plastics.
Japanese Experiment Module Airlock (JEM A/L) Setup:  In preparation for the upcoming Main Bus Switching Unit (MBSU) maintenance, today the crew extended the A/L slide table into the JEM pressurized module (JPM), removed the passive capture mechanism, and installed JEM ORU Transfer Interface (JOTI) on the slide table.  Next week, robotics ground controllers will remove an MBSU from its location outside the station and place it on the JEM A/L slide table for transfer inside.  Once inside, station crew will perform maintenance on the MBSU to recover its functionality and then pass it through the JEM A/L again for reinstallation outside the station.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Operations:  In preparation for the next USOS EVA planned for January 29, the crew performed tether and bag inspections, tool configuration, battery charging, procedures review, and conferences with the ground teams.
