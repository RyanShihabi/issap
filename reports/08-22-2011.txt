ISS On-Orbit Status 08/22/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Underway: Week 23 of Increment 28. As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as well as the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum undertook their 11th weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.        [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]  FE-4 Volkov completed the periodic (every Monday) verification of the automatic IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2, as well as the manual update on the non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the recent (8/8) installation of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Last day of the three-day test series of the Russian ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) ASN-M Satellite Navigation System which required CDR Borisenko to monitor communications between the RSK2 A31p laptop, which was running the test program, and the three active ASN NPM-1, NPM-3 & NPM-4 navigation electronics modules every 2 hrs during work hours.  Today, Andrey terminated the ASN-M testing at ~2:00pm EDT and downlinked data.      [The objective of the test was to confirm that array configurations for ATV docking in positive Solar Beta angles do not create unacceptable multipathing for the ASN RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System).  Both TRRJs (Thermal Radiator Rotary Joints) and both SARJs (Solar Alpha Rotary Joints) plus the 1B, 2B, 3A & 4A BGAs (Beta Gimbal Assemblies) were placed in Directed position for this test (i.e., not autotrack).  The test included 4 different array configurations, with periods of autotrack in between for power generation recovery.  A second ATV RGPS test at negative Betas is planned for 9/1 through 9/4.] FE-3 Garan had ~2h20m for configuring the Lab camcorder to provide live view of his subsequent work on the FIR FCF (Fluids Integrated Rack / Fluids & Combustion Facility), then ran another session with the PACE (Preliminary Advanced Colloids Experiment) hardware, mixing & using the 4th PACE sample (#2005) for processing.  PACE will be concluded this week.     [PACE is a Technology experiment, designed to investigate the capability of conducting high magnification colloid experiments with the LMM (Light Microscopy Module) for determining the minimum size particles which can be resolved with it.  Today’s activity steps included opening the AFC front door, rotating the LMM SBA (Light Microscopy Module Spindle Bracket Assembly) from the Operate to Service position and cleaning the oil from the LMM inside the AFC, mixing the 4th particle sample with the BCAT (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test) magnet, mounting the PACE test target and installing the sample and the PACE oil dispenser into the LMM AFC.  The AFC front door was closed and the oil started to be dispensed onto the sample.  The LMM Spindle Bracket Assembly was then rotated to the Operate position.  Ron closed the upper & lower FCF doors, turned on two switches and notified POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) that the rack is prepared for command on RPC (Remote Power Controller).] Later in the day, after again configuring the Lab video camcorder for live monitoring of his activities on the Node-1 side of CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), Garan opened the doors of the rack to remove/replace the Adsorber Cartridge when its lines were depressurized.  The FCF upper door was then closed, two switches turned and POIC notified of rack readiness for RPC activation.  Ron also supported SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center/Tsukuba) in troubleshooting the JAXA 3D TM750 camcorder in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) by activating the TM750 for SSIPC to check out the 3D HD (High Definition) image.  Afterwards, the camera was turned off and stowed. Other activities completed by Ron Garan included –Taking documentary photographs of the 5 GDS (Gas Delivery System) and PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gauges to record tank pressures;  [GDS and PFS in the HRF-2 (Human Research Facility 2) rack support the PPFS (Portable PFS)],Worked on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), performing periodic maintenance by evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration,Enabled power to the UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) of the RWS DCP (Robotic Workstation / Display & Control Panel) in the Node-3 Cupola, andContinued on the IFM (In-Flight Maintenance), started on 8/17, on the US IVA (Intravehicular Activity) toolbox, reconfiguring it by backfilling its empty slots with unpacked replacement tools flown on ULF-7 and moving selected tools from Tool Page Case (used on ULF-7) back to the toolbox. With the ITCS LTL (Internal Thermal Control System / Low Temperature Loop) activated in the US A/L (Airlock) for cooling (at least 8 hrs earlier), Mike Fossum performed post-ULF7 EVA maintenance on EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units) 3010 & 3018 with their SCUs (Service & Cooling Umbilicals), setting them up and starting the standard one-hour scrubbing process on the spacesuits’ cooling water loops, filtering ionic and particulate matter (via a 3-micron filter), followed by reconfiguring the cooling loops and starting the ~2hr biocide filtering.  A/L LTL flow was then terminated.  This activity met the periodic maintenance requirements for the EMUs.     [Loop scrubbing, incl. iodination of the LCVGs (Liquid Cooling & Ventilation Garments) for biocidal maintenance is done to eliminate any biomass and particulate matter that may have accumulated in the loops.] After reviewing uplinked Robonaut procedures for today, Mike & Satoshi assembled and installed the Robonaut device and its support hardware in the Lab at the P2 rack.  No movement was planned as yet, but the experimental device remained in a logic power state while ground specialists recorded joint & thermal data.  After the “soak” activity, a prerequisite to the rest of Robonaut research objectives, FE-5 & FE-6 disassembled it again along with the support hardware.       [Robonaut is an endeavor between NASA and GM (General Motors) to improve robotic technology & capabilities for future space exploration platforms.  It serves as a spring board to help evolve new robotic capabilities in space.  Robonaut demonstrates that a dexterous robot can launch & operate in a space vehicle, manipulate mechanisms in a microgravity environment, operate for an extended duration within the space environment, assist with tasks, and eventually interact with the crewmembers.  Robonaut not only looks like a human, but it also is designed to work like one.  With human-like hands and arms, Robonaut is able to use the same tools station crewmembers use.  In the future, the greatest benefits of humanoid robots in space may be as assistants for astronauts during spacewalks.  Robonaut is comprised of a robotic torso with a rotating waist, arms, a head with two high image cameras for eyes and a power pack (backpack).  It is connected to a support stanchion (vertical post or rod) at the waist via an adapter.  The stanchion interfaces to the ISS structure via a base plate and use of the seat track system.  The Robonaut Task Board has dummy (non-ISS interfaced) switches that Robonaut can interact with via ground or local ISS commanding.  Robonaut is commanded via remote guidance control using pre-verified command scripts for a series of pre-programmed tasks.  Success in each research operation is determined by the ground operators, based on the observations of the Robonaut performance recorded via cabin video and by Robonaut telemetry received on the ground.  Robonaut’s growth may be supported with hardware and/or software upgrades in future increments.  The full set of research objectives to be scheduled at a later time includes: Free Space Joint Manipulation, Task Board Operations, Low Risk ISS IVA Operations, Robonaut & Crew Interaction Operations, and Robonaut Public & Education Outreach.] Borisenko & Samokutyayev performed a comprehensive 2-hr inventory of all equipment to be returned to Earth on their Soyuz TMA-21/26S (#231) on 9/7, going over the formal document which both of them will have to sign to certify the return & handover of each individual item.      [Alexander Samokutyayev is the CDR of 26S, Andrey Borisenko the FE (as well as Ron Garan).] Sergei Volkov uninstalled & disassembled the hardware of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment which had been used to take structural dynamics data.  The gear was stowed in the FGB.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises], Later, Volkov performed the final steps of preparing Progress M-11M/43P for tomorrow morning’s undocking (5:34am EDT), by –Activating the spacecraft’s electronics and taking out the ventilation/heating air duct;Installing the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the SM aft port   [the StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM (Service Module), FGB, MRM2 and DC1],Removing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking & internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) which rigidized the joint,Closing the hatches; Conducting the standard one-hour leak checking of the SU docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress & SM aft port, andDownlinking the video depicting the close-out activities via OCA, for review by ground specialists.   [During hatch closure, leak checking and initial clamp installation, Russian thrusters as usual were inhibited due to load constraints (7:15am-9:10am).] Satoshi Furukawa opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Satoshi will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] Satoshi also set up the JAXA SSHDTV (Super Sensitive High-Definition Television) camera and its A31p control laptop with 120 VDC power supply for downlinking previously stored data from its 32GB memory/storage cards via the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and HRDL (High Rate Data Link) to the ground.  Afterwards, the dump was stopped and the setup decabled. CDR Borisenko did the daily routine inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, checking for proper fan operation by testing the air flow from the ventilators BO A04 & BO A05 and verifying that both LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are lit, then taking the periodic documentary photographs of the plants, the greenhouse, and himself as operator working on it.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]  Sergei conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.      [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers]. Sasha completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Satoshi undertook the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics.  At the end, FE-5 completed a self-assessment questionnaire.  Answers were then provided at test conclusion.     [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] Samokutyayev had another 2h reserved for more unpacking & stowing of cargo delivered on Progress M-10M/42P, logging moves in the IMS database. In the MRM1 Rassvet module, Sergei conducted the periodic task of tightening the BZV quick release screw clamps of the SSVP docking mechanism on the MRM1/Soyuz 27S docking interface, while Sasha performed the same task in MRM2 Poisk on the docking interface with Soyuz 26S. Furukawa & Fossum reviewed reference material for Satoshi’s next ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) session, i.e., the Echo and USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) protocol scheduled tomorrow, during which Mike will assist Satoshi as CMO/operator of the scans.  FE-5 then configured and mated USND-2 & VPC (Video Power Converter) and installed the USND-2 custom ISIS (International Subrack Interface Standard) within a stowage drawer in HRF Rack 1.      [Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD15, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).] Mike retrieved the SOLO PCBA (Sodium Loading in Microgravity / Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) measurement pouches from MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) at Lab S1 and relegated them to trash. Afterwards, FE-6 worked on MELFI-3, drying & cleaning its Dewar 1 and interior trays. Alex used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program at SM window #9 during a 30-min segment, taking pictures of glaciers in the Pamir Range, the Bear Glacier and Lake Sarez. In the SM, CDR Borisenko set up the equipment for upcoming condensate sampling, including KAV condensate container and gas/liquid separator, then collected samples from the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor (water recovery system) upstream of the FGS gas/liquid mixture filter/separator in an empty drink bag, a periodic check on the performance of the FGS.  More sampling will be done tomorrow and on 8/25. In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Furukawa supported the checkout of the power supply of the MSPR (Multipurpose Small Payload Rack), newly reconfigured by Garan with a DCU (DC Converter Unit)  on 8/19, by connecting of thermostat jumpers to Work Bench, Small Experiment Area and Work Volume, then closing the latter’s door.      [MSPR provides power and a variety of data interfaces (USB, Ethernet, IEEE1394 and video) to the experiment equipment that will be installed in the Work Volume, Small Experiment Area and Work Bench.  The MSPR DCU distributes power to subcomponents.  The crew operates its switches on the front panel to supply/shut down the power.] Andrey Borisenko & Sasha Samokutyayev, who will depart the ISS on 9/7 in Soyuz 26S, spent several hours handing over ISS task responsibilities today to Sergei Volkov who remains on board until November this year. At ~11:00am EDT, the CDR supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking greetings from the crew to the G.S. Titov Junior Cosmonauts Club at the St. Petersburg Educational Center which celebrates its 50th anniversary on 10/15. At ~4:25pm, the crew is scheduled for their weekly teleconference with ISS Program Management at JSC/Houston via Ku-band/video & S-band/audio. Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron turns on the MPC and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC was to be turned off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] FE-5 performed his 2nd session of the new Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4 – all 3 video recorded), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-5/Kinematics, FE-6/Sprint). No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
