New Status: 
Change of Command:  On Sunday, off-going ISS Commander (CDR) Chris Hadfield handed ISS command responsibilities over to CDR Pavel Vinogradov, making the 34 Soyuz (S) crew the prime crew in the event of an ISS emergency.
33 Soyuz (S) Cargo Return and Undock Preparations: FE-6 Marshburn collected and packed Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) area dosimeters for return on 33S. The EMU gloves and communication cap that were used on Saturday for the USOS EVA were also packed for return, as well as the late load items.  The 33S crew (Hadfield, Romanenko and Marshburn) completed preparations for undock.

33S Landing:  Soyuz 33S (TMA-07M, #704A) undocked from the International Space Station (ISS), Russian Segment (RS) Multi-purpose Research Module 1 (MRM1) Nadir docking port at GMT 133/23:07:54 (5:07 pm CDT).  Prior to the undocking, the crew performed leaks checks of the vestibule area between the MRM1 docking port and the Soyuz vehicle, suit leak checks and a leak check of the hatch between the descent module and the habitation module.  The undock command, which initiates the opening of the Soyuz vehicle docking hooks, was issued at GMT 133/23:05:00 (6:05 pm CDT).  Three minutes after the separation a fifteen second separation burn was performed.  The de-orbit burn was initiated at approximately GMT 134/01:37:11 (8:37 pm CDT) and was completed at approximately GMT 134/01:41:56 (8:41 pm CDT) and resulted in an approximately 128 m/sec deceleration.  Module separation occurred at approximately GMT 134/02:05:30 (9:05 pm CDT) followed by atmospheric entry at approximately GMT 134/02:08 (9:02 pm CDT).  Parachute deployment was scheduled to occur at approximately GMT 134/02:16:20 (9:16 pm CDT).  The Soyuz 33S vehicle landed at approximately GMT 134/02:30:52 (9:30 pm CDT) in the nominal (pre-planned) landing zone.  The vehicles final landing position was in the horizontal position.
Previous Status (05/09/10):
US Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 21: FE-3 Cassidy and FE-6 Marshburn (EV-1 and EV-2 respectively) performed US EVA 21 today, during which they translated to the P6 truss and removed and inspected the 2B Pump Flow Control System (PFCS).  No ice or foreign material was reported and imagery was taken for ground analysis.  They then replaced it with a spare from the legacy Early External Thermal Control System (EETCS) system.  The failed PFCS was stowed in the spare’s original location.  While the crew was still within viewing distance of the area, the newly installed pump was activated.  They reported that there was no evidence of leakage.  Ground teams are assessing the data from the system.  During translation back to the Airlock the crew took the opportunity to relocate an APFR out of the line of sight between the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) window and the newly installed PFCS. The duration of the EVA was 5:31.
