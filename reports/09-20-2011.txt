ISS On-Orbit Status 09/20/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. At wake-up, CDR Mike Fossum & FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Before breakfast & first exercise, Volkov & Furukawa took a full session each with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis, one of four Russian crew health status assessments currently being conducted (the other three: MO-3 (Physical Fitness Evaluation), MO-7 (Calf Volume Measurement) & MO-8 (Body Mass Measurement).   Afterwards, Sergei closed out and stowed the Urolux hardware.        [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).] Fossum meanwhile set up & installed the MERLIN-3 (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator 2) refrigerator in ER-1 (EXPRESS Rack 1), Locker 6, after loading the MERLIN-3 payload application software onto the ELC1 (ER1 Laptop Computer).  Mike connected its cabling, inserted desiccant packs, configured MERLIN’s switches to set it for +4 degC, and later checked its function. The CDR also looked through the T2 treadmill’s maintenance kit to verify the presence of the T2 grease gun in a plastic bag, aided by an uplinked photograph.  Furukawa terminated his overnight DK (Diagnostic Kit) Electroencephalograph data take which recorded his brainwaves during sleep, saving the measurements on the medical laptop and running an analysis.   This was followed by a diagnostic check of his physical condition with a video camera for the ground. FE-4 Volkov conducted the routine verification of yesterday’s refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the installation on 8/8 of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Later, Sergei continued the updating of the Ethernet CSL (Crew Support LAN/Local Area Network) in the SM, installing and test-activating the two Lenovo T61p laptops retrieved yesterday from stowage, viz., CSL5 for the Port CQ (Crew Quarters), CSL6 for the Stbd CQ. Volkov also performed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verified proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.       [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] With the G1 HD camcorder set up in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) for downlinking his activity, Satoshi conducted another LEGO EPO (Education Payload Activity) session with Lego Bricks, building a Lego Hubble Telescope model from a guide book for ground audiences. Other activities completed by Satoshi Furukawa included –Photographing three Hearing Protection Ziploc bags to help determine the approximate number of Deci-Damps disposable ear plugs (aka “Foamies”) onboard ISS and available to the crew,  [for subsequent downlink, the images were stored on SSC-8 (Station Support Computer 8)],Performing another session with the psychological POMS (Profile of Mood States) experiment, completing his questionnaire for downlink to ground specialist,Replacing the A31p ELC laptop in ER4 with a new T61p laptop computer and initiating battery charge (at least 2 hrs),Opening the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images could be captured today by ground commanding;  [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use],Installing the CSI-5 PHAB (CGBA Science Insert / Plant Habitat) into CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) after setting up the G1 camcorder in the Lab for covering the activity;   [this involved installing 2 brackets & 2 camera modules in CGBA, planting 6 germination flasks with three flasks in each bracket, then re-cabling and activating it.  The CSI-05 plant experiment focuses on characteristics associated with successful germination in space.  On Earth, the roots and shoots of a young plant respond to light, gravity and mechanical stimuli.  However, because of the ever presence of gravity on Earth, it is difficult to determine which of these three factors impact roots and shoots the most.  This is important to know for crops grown in zero-G.  This educational experiment utilizes the seed from the Brassica plant (mustard family)], andUsing the G1 as well as the TM750 3D camcorders to shoot video of onboard scenes in Kibo JPM and other ISS modules, after an SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center) check of the latter’s 3D HD picture, followed by playback-downlink of the footage via MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) high-rate data link. CDR Fossum unstowed the potable water sample collected from the WRS1 RIP (Water Recovery System 1 / Rack Interface Panel) on 9/9 for inflight analysis with the CWQMK (Colorimetric Water Quality Monitoring Kit), first establishing an Iodine standard, then completing the Silver standard and analysis.      [Afterwards, data were downloaded and the CWQMK kit stowed temporarily in the CWQMK Nomex pouch.  Mike had protected the Iodine analysis syringe against glass breakage by placing Kapton tape on both ends.]  Next, Fossum reviewed “Big Picture” reference material for the BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) payload operations scheduled tomorrow.         [The new experiment run is with a Harvard University phase separation sample using a different setup than for the recent crystal samples 9 & 10, mainly requiring an SSC laptop with EarthKAM timing software, power cables and camera USB cable.  For illumination, the Mini-MagLite and Flash batteries do not need to be changed yet, but the camera will need a freshly charged battery.  After Mike mixed the sample (#4) for phase separation and took test photos, the EarthKAM software began taking pictures of Sample 4 for 13 days at different intervals throughout the run.  This will require camera battery changes twice a day and image check with a battery change once per day.] In preparation for the arrival of Soyuz 28S with Burbank, Shkaplerov & Ivanishin on 11/16, the CDR relocated the 27S (prime) crew’s PEP (Portable Emergency Provisions) equipment to the FGB and pre-configured the emergency equipment of the 28S crew.       [After removing the previous prime crew name labels from the Ammonia Respirators and relocating the masks to the respirator stockpile, Mike moved the current 27S (prime) crew’s respirators from MRM1 to FGB, got three respirators from the FGB stockpile, labeled them for the upcoming crew and stowed them in MRM2, then took the Ammonia Detection kit from MRM1 to MRM2, and reported the various serial numbers to TsUP-Moscow.]  FE-4 Volkov meanwhile performed the periodic/long-term inspection of the SM RO (Working Compartment)’s pressure shell and rings, looking for any moisture, deposits, mold, corrosion and pitting behind panels 130, 131, 134, 135, 137, 138, 139, 432, and also underneath the TVIS treadmill (where deposit was discovered in the past) and the cold plates (where SNT and STR lines are installed).  Last time done: 12/13/10.     [The inspection of the hull surface, which is coated with a primer and dark-green enamel, is done using cleaning napkins to wipe the area in question if required and reporting results to the ground.  The hull inspection looks for changed color and cavities; if cavities are found, they are to be measured for depth (with chewing gum) after cleaning.  Digital photographs of the shell before and after the removal of deposits were to be made for documentation.] Sergei conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Working from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, FE-4 also completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Mike Fossum had ~2 hrs to perform a NASA EPO (Education Payload Operations) video demonstration, first reviewing the scheduled educational “EPO Earth/Moon/Mars” session procedures, then setting up the video camcorder for the planned DVD and teaming with Satoshi Furukawa in using scale models to discuss size and distance between the Earth, Moon, and Mars.      [The demo was timed such that EPO ground personnel could watch, for providing real-time feedback during the demo.  The high-definition G1 camcorder tape was played back via the MPC. ] At ~9:35am EDT, Satoshi Furukawa took ~10 min to discuss tomorrow’s scheduled JAXA Green Tea Ceremony experiment with the PI (Principal Investigator) at SSIPC/Tsukuba.       [This will be the first time that the famed Japanese tea ceremony is conducted in space.  For the PI (a computer graphics artist) it is important to get data of dynamics of the fluid and bubbles that contain powder of green tea in microgravity for future computer graphics products.  The PI wants to propose the succession of Japanese traditional culture and spirits toward the Space Age by designing the new tools and the new style to conduct the Japanese tea ceremony.            These products will be used for exhibition in October 2011.   PI questions are:  How are bubbles formed, and what are their shapes and sizes in the micro-G state; are there unique phenomena in the micro-G state when the green tea is stirred, and what are the differences (advantages & disadvantages) between “on ground” and “in micro-G”  for the future tea ceremony in space?]  At ~12:25pm, CDR Fossum supported an educational PAO TV event, responding to questions from 4th-8th grade students from two Denver area schools at Fiske Planetarium at the University of Colorado, Boulder, CO.      [Does space travel change the way your body works?  What do you eat in space?  How do you keep track of time?  What kind of experiments do you do?  Were you scared or nervous the first time you left Earth?  Why did you choose to be an astronaut?  Did you see Hurricane Irene from space?  How do you use math in space?  What do you do for fun?  How many days will you be in space?  What is the biggest adjustment to living on space station?] At ~12:55pm, Fossum conducted another VHF-1 emergency communications proficiency check over NASA’s VHF (Very High Frequency) stations, today with the VHF site at WAL/Wallops (12:59:23pm-1:07:24pm), for a voice check with Houston/Capcom, MSFC/PAYCOM (Payload Operation & Integration Center Communicator), Moscow/GLAVNI (TsUP Capcom), EUROCOM/Munich and JCOM/Tsukuba in the normal fashion via VHF radio from a handheld microphone and any of the USOS ATUs (Audio Terminal Units).        [Purpose of the test is to verify signal reception and link integrity, improve crew proficiency, and ensure minimum required link margin during emergency (no TDRS) and special events (such as a Soyuz relocation).] At ~2:15pm, Sergei Volkov is scheduled for his standard weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- & Ku-band audio/video. Before “Presleep” period tonight, FE-5 turns on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Satoshi will turn MPC off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] A task listed for Sergei on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today continues to be the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Foelsche Impact Crater, North Australia (looking right of track for this 6-km-diameter crater.  It stands out as a lighter-toned, circular feature.  Ages of the surrounding rocks show that the impact occurred more than 545 million years ago and we have no images of this crater in the CEO database.  Recommended was a mapping strip of this target at the beginning of the acquisition window), Volga - Ural Delta (looking near nadir for the Volga River delta.  Overlapping mapping frames of channels and wetlands in the delta are of particular interest for photography), Cairo, Egypt (Cairo is the capital city of Egypt and is the largest city in Africa.  It is also one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with an estimated population of 6.8 million people living within the city, and an estimated 10 million living outside the city proper.  Looking slightly left of track to document land use and urban boundaries with context views of this city), and Konza Prairie, Kansas (looking left of track for this broad, indistinct target located in the eastern Kansas region with fair weather expected.  The Konza Prairie is one of the LTER [Long Term Ecological Research] sites.  This target is located in the Flint Hills of northeastern Kansas.  The vegetation is primarily native tall grass prairie.  CEO imagery will help in the study of the effects of fire, grazing and climate variability as well as help to document the grassland ecosystems.  Overlapping frames with a short lens in a mapping pass were requested).
