New Status:
H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)-4 Capture and Berthing: Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) in Hot Backup configuration.  Cassidy, Nyberg and Parmitano monitored the HTV4 approach from the Cupola Robotics Work Station (RWS) and successfully captured HTV using the SSRMS at approximately 6:22 am CDT. Robotics Ground Controllers then maneuvered it to and installed it on, the Node-2 Nadir Active CBM (ABCM).  Cassidy utilized the Node-2 Nadir ACBM to capture HTV4, then Robotic Ground Controllers released the SSRMS from HTV4, maneuvered it to grapple the HTV4 Exposed Pallet (EP) and performed a checkout of the HTV Berthing Camera System (HBCS). Once berthed, the 16 bolts on Node 2 nadir were driven to mechanically attach HTV4 to ISS. Parmitano and Nyberg then performed vestibule pressurization and outfitting. Ingress is scheduled for Saturday, August 10.
 
Russian Segment (RS) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 34 Preparations:  FE-2 Misurkin and FE-4 Yurchikhin performed a Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) review of the translation paths for the upcoming RS EVA 34, scheduled for August 16th.  
 
Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Emulsions (InSPACE)-3: Nyberg initiated the third of 42 planned science runs. The InSpace experiment is performed in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG), and runs are initiated by setting current levels and pulse frequencies.  InSPACE-3 studies the behavior of magnetic colloidal fluids which transition to a solid-like state by the formation and cross-linking of microstructures in the presence of a magnetic field. This technology can be used for vibration damping systems and can improve the design of structures.
