ISS On-Orbit Status 02/27/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew rest day.   At wake-up (1:00am EST), FE-1 Suraev did the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-1 again inspects the filters tonight before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]   At wake-up, FE-6 Creamer started his FD60 (Flight Day 60) session of the Pro K protocol, his third onboard run, performing the first urine pH spot test and later logging his diet intact of today.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]   Later in the day, TJ set up the Nutrition/Repository/Pro K hardware for his 24-hour generic urine collections which will begin tomorrow.   The five station residents performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]   As part of the house cleaning, Suraev & Kotov conducted regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and also Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).   Later, the FE-1 worked on the BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment in the SM, using tweezers to thin out the plants, leaving the five most developed Mizuna plants in each row in Root Module #22 & #21.  The removed plants were discarded.    [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-16 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP), currently planted with Mizuna seeds.  Mizuna (Brassica rapa nipposinica) is a tasty variety of Japanese mustard greens, also known as California Peppergrass, eaten as a salad.]    With the UPA (Urine Processing Assembly) up and running, CDR Williams completed another manual fill of its WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly) in the morning, from a Russian EDV-U (urine collector-water container).   In the SM, Maxim completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   Jeff Williams’ planned PanOptic eye test, which was deferred yesterday, will be conducted today just before bedtime.  The test requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination performed by Noguchi as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) with an ophthalmoscope.    [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still & video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula & optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.]   Timothy Creamer completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops.   In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Soichi Noguchi conducted a second hermeticity test on the newly installed CGSE (Common Gas Supply Equipment) valve unit, using the CGSE Upper GBU (Gas Bottle Unit) with CO2 for leak checking.    [The first leak test was done on 2/25.  The CO2 is supplied for the upcoming Myo Lab Experiment during Flight 19A.]   The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive device (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).   For their new session of taking their Bisphosphonates Alendronate pill starting tomorrow morning, Soichi & Jeff begin their required overnight fast tonight: no intakes except plain water until 30 min after swallowing the pill.   At ~6:00am EST, FE-5 Noguchi had a CDE (Crew Discretionary Event) via S-Band and Public Call 4 for audio and KU for video.   At ~8:05am, the crew held their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.   At ~11:00am EST, CDR Williams conducted his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).   At ~2:00pm, FE-1 Suraev & FE-4 Kotov downlinked a PAO TV message of congratulatory greetings to V.P. Savinykh for his 70th anniversary on 3/7.    [Viktor Petrovich Savinykh, a veteran pilot-astronaut and twice Hero of the Soviet Union, Doctor of Engineering, Professor, Associate Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and chief editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos Journal, is the President of the Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography.]  Weekly Science Update (Expedition Twenty-Two -- Week 13)   3-D SPACE:    No report.

Canberra is situated in the highlands of the Great Dividing Range of southeastern Australia.  As ISS approached from the SW, looking nadir for this target urban area about 20 miles SW of Lake George.  Detailed views were not required), Simon's Bay, Cape Point, S. Africa (HMS Beagle Site:  Darwin and the Beagle stopped here in June, 1836.  The most important aspect of this stop appears to have been Darwin's visit to the noted astronomer Sir John Herschel who lived near Cape Town.  Darwin called this "the most memorable event which, for a long period, I have had the good fortune to enjoy."  Both Darwin and Herschel had read the Lyell's famous Principles of Geology. Their discussion is not recorded, but they were thinking along similar lines: a few months earlier Herschel had written to Lyell praising the Principles as "a complete revolution in [its] subject, … altering entirely the point of view" in which scientists would think about geology; and as opening a way for bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others."  You will approach the South African coast from the northwest at mid-morning with clear weather expected and a near nadir view), Chaiten Volcano, S. Chile (ISS had a mid-afternoon pass with fair weather over this recently reactivated volcano in southern Chile.  Prior to its eruption in May 2008, the volcano had been quiet for more than 9000 years; it has caused significant damage to the town of Chaiten located to the southwest.  After crossing the large, outer Isle of Chiloe, looking near nadir and just inland for the volcano.  Staying ready for the next target in less than four minutes), and Buenos Aires, Argentina (the Argentine capital of just over three million is located in the eastern part of the country on the great, turbid estuary, the Rio de la Plata.  After crossing the northern plains of Patagonia, ISS approached this target from the SW in mid-afternoon with fair weather expected).
