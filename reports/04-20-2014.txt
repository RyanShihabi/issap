SpaceX (SpX)-3 Dragon Capture/Berth and Ingress:  The crew captured Dragon at 6:14am CDT today.  During the approach, there were some minor Ultra High Frequency (UHF) comm dropouts, but the channel swap-overs were well within Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) time constraints.  Berthing to the Node 2 Nadir port was performed by the ground teams.  Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) bolt capture was completed with 15 of 16 bolts; the 16th bolt was binding and was retracted.  The crew then completed pressurization and outfitting of the Node 2 to Dragon vestibule.  Ingress is scheduled for tomorrow.
Commercial Protein Crystal Growth-High Density Protein Crystal Growth Modified (CPCG-HM) Review: Commander (CDR) Wakata and Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Swanson conducted a procedures review in preparation for upcoming CPCG-HM operations. CPCG-HM (Commercial Protein Crystal Growth High Density Modified) is a National Laboratory Office experiment that is intended to demonstrate the scientific and commercial value of protein crystallization on a long-duration microgravity mission. This will be accomplished using flight hardware that accommodates high-value proteins whose structures cannot be determined through ground-based methods. Studying protein crystals grown in microgravity could provide useful information in the development of new drugs.
Nanoracks Onboard Computer Based Training (OBCBT): Swanson reviewed OCBT materials for accessing NanoRacks Platforms, Reconfiguration of Modules, and operation of the NanoRacks Microscope-1 and Microsocpe-2. He also completed a review of On Board Training (OBT) materials for NanoRacks BioRack Centrifuge Operations. These experiments are life-science payloads that investigate cell growth under 1-g and micro-g conditions.
Nitrogen (N2) Repress:  A nitrogen repress was completed from the 53P tanks.
