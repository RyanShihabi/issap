Radiation Dosimetry Inside ISS-Neutron (RaDI-N) Retrieval:  Today a USOS crewmember retrieved all 8 of the Space Bubble Detectors that were deployed last week for the RaDI-N experiment, and transferred them to the Russian crewmember for processing in the Bubble Reader. This Canadian Space Agency (CSA) RaDI-N investigation measures neutron radiation levels while onboard the ISS.  Bubble detectors are used as neutron monitors designed to only detect neutrons and ignore all other radiation.
Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) preparations:  Today the crew performed EVA tether inspections, tool configurations, cuff checklist printing, scheduled health checkups, and procedure reviews in preparation for the tomorrow’s EVA.  The primary goal of tomorrow’s EVAs is to Remove and Replace (R&R) a Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Latching End Effector (LEE) which had been exhibiting some anomalies in its operation.
Lab Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) Blower Speed Test – Today, ground controllers began a 7 day test of the Lab CDRA using higher blower speeds. The CDRA blower speed will be gradually increased to determine the ability of the CDRA blower to operate at increased speeds without triggering software responses to excessive speed and to evaluate impacts of elevated speed to the blower.
