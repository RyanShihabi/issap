ISS On-Orbit Status 07/18/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    First day of full crew complement of 6 for Expedition 32.  Sleep Cycle is back to “normal” – wake: 2:00am, sleep 5:30pm EDT. At wakeup, Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Upon wakeup, FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Williams & FE-6 Hoshide completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 22nd for Joe, the first for Suni & Aki.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] CDR Padalka started the day with the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] Afterwards, the CDR worked in the DC1 Docking Compartment to start the regular urine transfer from two EDV-U containers to the BV2 Rodnik (“spring”) water storage tank of Progress M-15M/47P (#415), docked at DC1, using the usual pumping equipment with the electric compressor (#41).  The BV2 bladder was checked for leak-tightness on 5/11.        [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]  With its battery freshly charged yesterday, Sergei Revin set up the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment, installed yesterday at SM window #9, then used it to take spectral and photographic imagery of Earth’s surface and atmosphere under ground commanding.  Later, FE-2 dismantled the equipment for stowage and dumped the data from Laptop 3 via the RSS1 terminal.        [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] Sergei also conducted another 1h 25m session with the KPT-2 payload suite of BAR science instruments, with Piren-V and TTM-2, conducting air temperature and humidity monitoring in the RS (Russian Segment) to fill the mapped database to populate the mapped RS data base.       [KPT-2 monitors problem areas, necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data are copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities are supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer / thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] FE-3 powered up the amateur/ham radio equipment in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and SM which had been off during the Soyuz rendezvous & docking. Afterwards, Joe Acaba, Aki Hoshide & Suni Williams jointly reviewed the procedures for the HTV-3 OBT (H-II Transfer Vehicle Onboard Training) course for the MSS (Mobile Servicing System) ROBoT activities during HTV-3 capture and berthing, then performed the first MSS training session, supported by ground specialist teleconferences at ~6:00am (Rendezvous Ops) and ~11:45am (MSS Debrief).     [The HCP (HTV Control Panel) was temporarily set up in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and its power & data cables routed through the Cupola to the RWS (Robotic Workstation).  With Lab RWS DCP (Display & Control Panel) powered via the bypass cable, and the CCR (Cupola Crew Restraint) installed at the Cup RWS, the crew also enabled power to the Cup RWS UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) and practiced offset grapple approaches using the PMM FRGF (Permanent Multipurpose Module Flight Releasable Grapple Fixture).  Afterwards, the CCR was taken down again and the HCP removed and temp stowed in JPM until needed for HTV Capture ops.]  For the practicing of offset grapple approaches, Acaba closed the protective shutters of the Lab window and opened them later in support of ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera) ground-controlled operations.  FE-4 Malenchenko had 2h 30m set aside for transferring cargo items from Soyuz 31S to the ISS for stowage, with IMS (Inventory Management System) support. Afterwards, Yuri worked in the Orbital Module (BO) of the spacecraft, installing and connecting the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its TA765B/PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit from SM stowage, recycled from an earlier vehicle. FE-4 was also tasked to go on a search for a spare Kazbek-UM seat restraint latch for Soyuz 31S (#706).Padalka brought the RODF (Russian Operations Data Files) up to date by replacing books or inserting new pages delivered on Soyuz 31S, and prepacking old material for disposal in Progress 47P. Gennady also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sergei Revin took care of the daily IMS maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). In the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), FE-5 Williams worked on the new InSPACE-3 (Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Emulsions) experiment, using the BCAT-3 magnet to initiate the vial assemblies by evenly distributing the floating particles, observed from the ground on live camcorder during AOS (Acquisition of Signal) and recorded during LOS (Loss of Signal). Afterwards, Suni took on her first session with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MDLT (Medical Laptop) and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.      [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.] Sergei made preparations and reviewed procedures for the periodic inspection & photography of RS window panes. Gennady set up the FSS Photo Spectrum System at an SM window to observe & photograph the flooding area in the Russian Kuban region, to obtain additional data on contamination and degree of natural destruction caused by catastrophic flooding in Krymsk area.     [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] Padalka also performed the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from two CWCs (Contingency Water Containers, #1085, #1084) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container (#1000).  Once filled, the EDV is connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.] FE-2 Revin completed another collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Sergei’s 4th time.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] The three Russian crewmembers each had 1.5 hrs scheduled on their timeline for joint handover activities. The Soyuz 31S crew Malenchenko, Williams & Hoshide had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. CDR & FE-2 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Sergei at ~11:55am, Gennady at ~3:45pm.  The 31S crew had their standard post-launch PMCs (Private Medical Conferences, Akihiko at ~7:40am, Sunita at ~9:55am, Yuri at ~4:50pm EDT. Suni had ~15 min set aside for reviewing overview/reference material for BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids) payload operations. Before Presleep, FE-3 will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~8:35am, the six crewmembers had their weekly teleconference with ISS Program Management at JSC/Houston via Ku-band/video & S-band/audio. At ~1:55pm, the crew is scheduled to support a PAO TV event, responding to an interview with NBC Nightly News (Brian Williams) and downlinking messages for the NBC “Today” Show for use on th Olympics opening on 7/27 and two greetings (Suni only) for the 8/12 Boston Triathlon and 8/16 “Train Like an Astronaut” event at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, MA. Williams, Hoshide & Malenchenko took in the obligatory CMS (Countermeasures Systems) exercise overview which is required of each new crewmember prior to the first physical exercised session.      [The crewmembers familiarized themselves with location and usage of items such as the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) components (chest strap, transmitter, watch), TVIS & CEVIS PCMCIA memory cards, treadmill harness, ergometer & athletic shoes, and the SBS (Series Bungee System) assembly.] Malenchenko also brushed up on TVIS exercising by observing Revin’s treadmill run, and Hoshide familiarized himself with the T2/COLBERT machine by watching Acaba sing it. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).  Tasks listed for Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Taking two photos of the internal part of the MRM1 docking port’s SSVP-StM docking cone to obtain digital imagery of the scratch or scuff mark left by the head of the Soyuz 31S active docking probe on the internal surface of the passive drogue (docking cone) ring, a standard practice after Russian dockings, then downlinking the pictures via OCA assets;   [these images are used to refine current understanding of docking conditions.  The objective is to take photo imagery of the scratch or scuff marks left by the head of the docking probe on the internal surface of the drogue (docking cone, ASP) ring, now rotated out of the passageway.  Before shooting the picture, the cosmonaut highlights the scuffmark with a marker and writes the date next to it.  As other crewmembers before him, Gennady used the Nikon D2X digital still camera to take the pictures with the hatch partially closed],A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos & videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). ISS/ATV Reboost:  A one-burn reboost of the ISS with the ATV-3 OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters was performed yesterday as planned at 11:16pm EDT with a burn duration of 19 min 25 sec, achieving a Delta-V of 2.85 m/s (planned: 2.82 m/s), increasing mean altitude by 4.98 km (planned: 4.97 km).  After the burn, ISS was at 403.2 km mean altitude, with 408.5 km apogee height and 397.9 km perigee height.  ISS attitude control authority was handed over to Russian MCS (Motion Control System) at ~9:50pm for ATV control in TEA (Torque Equilibrium Attitude) and was returned to US CMG momentum management at ~11:30pm.  Purpose of the reboost was to set up phasing for the accelerated (4-orbit) 48P rendezvous.   CEO targets uplinked for today were Monaco, Monaco (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  The tiny Principality of Monaco is a sovereign city-state of just over three-fourths of a square mile in area.  It is located on eastern part of the French Cote d’ Azure, between Nice and the Italian border.  ISS southeastward, nadir pass over this portion of the southern coast of France was in late morning light with clear weather expected.  At this time the crew was to begin looking nadir for this bulge in the coast marked by harbor facilities), Mount Vesuvius, Italy (this 4,203 ft stratovolcano of ancient Pompeii fame remains a threat to the nearby urban area of Naples in southern Italy today.  ISS approach was from the NW in late morning with clear weather expected.  At this time as they tracked along the western coast of Italy, the crew was to look slightly right of track for detailed views of the summit area of this volcanic peak), Victoria, Seychelles (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  The Seychelles are a continental fragment left stranded in the western Indian Ocean during India's plate tectonic movement northeast towards Asia.  Victoria is the capital city of the Republic of Seychelles and is located on the northeastern side of Mahe Island, the largest island of the archipelago.  At this time, as ISS tracked southeastward over the open ocean in fair weather, the crew was to try to spot this target and to acquire context view with the entire island and city in a single frame), St. Helena Island, Atlantic Ocean (HMS BEAGLE SITE:  Darwin and the Beagle arrived at St. Helena Island on July 8, 1836 and remained for 5 days to explore its geology.  Crew was to begin looking for this target a little early, if possible.  Due to its remoteness and small size [47 square miles], there were no visual cues of the island during ISS approach.  As the crew progressed on this mid-afternoon descending pass from the NW, they were to look towards nadir for this small island.  There may have been a few clouds in the region, but they were to try for detailed shots), Virginia Coast Reserve, Virginia (LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH [LTER] SITE:  The midday, near-nadir pass was clear weather with ISS approaching from the NW.  This is a National Science Foundation sponsored site with research focused on the mainland marches and lagoon systems behind the islands of the southern Delmarva Peninsula, particularly Hog and Parramore Islands), Shortgrass Steppe, Colorado (LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH SITE:  ISS had a nadir pass approaching from the NW over this site with a few late-morning clouds.  At this time, as it passed over Laramie Mountains into the Great Plains, the crew was to begin a nadir mapping strip that continues until they reached the lush agricultural areas along the Platte River.  The research focus is the effect of grazing on the extent and character of vegetation cover, which are in continuous change).
