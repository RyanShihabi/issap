ISS On-Orbit Status 11/12/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty. After wakeup, FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also at wake-up, CDR Mike Fossum & FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Fossum checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera & flashlight battery charge.  The Nikon D2Xs camera with EarthKAM software running with the Intervalometer on SSC-18 (Station Support Computer 18) is taking automated flash photography of Sample 3.      [After starting on 11/10, the camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking one photo each hour.  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6 Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.] Mike, Satoshi & Sergey joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.  Since this was the last scheduled round of Housekeeping for Exp-29, Mike & Satoshi paid special attention to some safeguarding issues to ensure a good configuration in the unlikely event of station decrewing (failure of 28S crew arriving): Flammable materials securely stowed away from UOPs (Utility Outlet Panels), Rack Power Outlets, and Power Strips, no loose items that could become free-floaters during nominal dynamic events, ventilation diffusers clear of stowage, and HEPA filters vacuum-cleaned.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the Potok Air Purification System pre-filters in SM & FGB.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. FE-4 reset the Kenwood TM D700”Sputnik” amateur radio station in the SM in Repeater Mode with the running Russian KPT-14 SHADOW-BEACON (Tenj-Mayak) experiment.  Later, the station was turned off.     [Objective of the experiment is the automatic retranslation of time tag (pre-planned executable) packets from ground stations.  SHADOW (or ECLIPSE), sponsored by Roskosmos and its leading Moscow research organization TSNIIMASH (Central Research Institute of Machine Building), employs VHF amateur radio (ham) operators around the globe (via ARISS/Amateur Radio on ISS) to help in observing refraction/scattering effects in artificial plasmas using the method of RF (radio frequency) sounding in space experiments under different geophysical conditions.  This experiment has been run by Dmitri Kondratyev, Oleg Skripochka, Fyodor Yurchikhin, Yuri Malenchenko and Mikhail Tyurin (first time in November 2006.] Sergey also completed the daily routine servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Fossum filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] CDR & FE-4 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) on today’s schedule, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sergey at ~7:05am, Mike at ~1:40pm EST. At ~4:40am, the CDR powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 4:45am conducted a ham radio session with students at the ISS (Science High School) “G. Marconi” in Bari, Italy.     [The institute, founded in 1940, is specialized in technological field and at the same time it is a scientific high school (applied science). There are more than 600 students, and the ARI (Radioamateur Association of Bari) is a part of the ISS “Marconi” body. The Institute has participated in EduSat project, headed by ASI (Italian Space Agency) in collaboration with IMT - Ingegneria Marketing e Tecnologia (Italian SME).  The ISS “Marconi” was the main Institute among South Italy High Schools involved in the above project.  EduSAT is still in progress and the students are studying aerospace concept such as space environment, space telecommunication, satellite subsystems and so on.  A Technological Satellite Simulator has been realized by IMT to help students make experiments in the laboratory.]  ISS Amateur/Ham Statistics Update:  17 contacts for Mike, 11 contacts for Satoshi, 28 for Exp-28, 14 for Inc 29/30, 116 during 2011, and 682 total Project events. At ~7:40am, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~10:35am, the crew joined for supporting a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking multilingual greetings to the participants of the Russian Olympians Ball on 11/25 at the Manezh Central Exhibition Hall in Moscow dedicated to the 100th Anniversary of the Russian Olympic Committee. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-4, FE-5). Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the Vulcan Hierro, South Island Canary Islands, Glacier Allalin Kursk Reserve, Lipetsk Metallurgical Plant holdings in the Voronezh area, Hong Kong, Kursk Reserve, floodplain and the Volga delta, monitoring oil pollution of the Caspian Sea, Aral Sea region, Pamir: Bear Glacier, Kerch Strait, Taman Laganakskoe plateau, Krasnaya Polyana, Kolka glacier, River Terek, Baku, Glacier Allalin;Inspecting & photographing the space behind SM panel 338 (to develop a procedure for installation of the ЕКТS JuА309 mono unit on Regul-OS work area 3 to replace the SA25-3 device removed in April 2011),Photographing the CP (Central Post) SSC laptop connection to the TVS television system,Conducting the daily inspection of the running Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.

The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.

GEOFLOW-2 (ESA):      After being on-hold due the USOC preparing for other experiment’s operations, on 11/7 the GEOFLOW-2 science runs were resumed – starting with the no-rotation run i10 (at Tcold lowest and initial delta-T at 9.9K, decreasing by steps of 0.4K). However, due to anomalies (see FSL: temperature deviations and MVIS lock-up) GEOFLOW-2 science runs are on-hold awaiting the outcome of the engineering investigations.    [Background: Everybody is familiar with liquids. In an average day we get to use, handle or drink water or other liquids.  And everybody knows how fluids (that is liquids and gases) behave: when subjected to a net force, may be pressure, a temperature difference or gravity, they can move freely.  Scientists have been studying how fluids move for centuries, and managed to write mathematical formulas that can describe and predict such movements. Unfortunately, these equations are extremely complex and only approximate solutions are known. As a result, our quantitative understanding of fluid movement is just partial. This is especially true for natural phenomena where the forces can be enormous and unpredictable, like in oceans or in the atmosphere. Or the interior of the earth, where rocks are exposed to pressures and temperatures so incredibly high that they slowly move and adapt their shape. That is, over hundreds of years rocks flow just like a very viscous liquid. Scientists try to study such flows but cannot observe them directly due to the fact that they take place deep beneath the surface of our planet. The only way is to have computers simulating those movements starting from the equations, but how to check whether computers are correct? This is what GeoFlow II is trying to answer on board the International Space Station. GeoFlow II is a miniature planet that has some of its essential ingredients: a fluid can freely move inside a spherical container that rotates, has temperature differences and has a simulated gravity directed towards the centre just like in a real planet. By taking pictures of the fluid  movements, scientists are able to understand the essential characteristics of the flows and determine whether computer simulations are correct or whether they need to be refined and improved towards a better understanding of the elusive movements that take place inside our planet.] HAIR (JAXA):      No report.

You replaced the CIR FOMA Cal Unit and closed and opened bottle valves to support the calibration of CIR's FOMA (Fuel/Oxidizer Management Assembly) on GMT 314. This calibration needs to be completed yearly to ensure that all the pressure transducers in the CIR are accurate. We especially appreciate your diligence with inspecting and photo documenting the faulty F/O cable. We did determine during the CIR's powered operations later in the day on GMT 313, that the newly installed F/O is successfully transmitting data. Great news! Good work cleaning and installing this cable!  On 11/8, we also determined that the settings we changed on the ground successfully fixed the problem with the CIR's main software controller (FCF I/O Processor).  After the change to the FLEX-2 configuration, the FCF I/O Processor was unusually slow processing telemetry because there was a bottleneck with data getting to the ground. With both these problems fixed and with a calibrated FOMA, we're ready to return to FLEX test points in Week 9.

SODI/COLLOID (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument/Colloid):      During the final runs, the so-called “demixing runs”, temperatures above the critical point were applied to the experimental cells potentially leading to an irreversible transition (= phase separation) in the samples. On 11/3 the “demixing runs” were completed for all COLLOID cells. In addition, a “demixing run” was also completed for the reference cell providing additional data prior to the experiment close-out. After successful completion of the COLLOID#2 experiment, the science team is looking forward to getting the COLLOID#2 Flash Disk returned on Earth in order to complete their data analyses (so far based on downlinked data). SODI-DSC (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument/Diffusion & Soret Coefficient, ESA):      “Thanks, Satoshi, for installation of SODI-DSC inside the MSG facility on 11/7!”  During initialization of SODI-DSC there was a problem on connecting the Image Processing Unit (IPU) with one of the two camera units, and since power-cycling did not solve the problem SODI was de-activated. On 11/9 this communication problem due to an incorrect network address (aka MAC address) was solved via ground commanding. After this configuration file update, SODI DSC was successfully initialized and the checkout runs were completed. The outcome of the checkout runs allow for fine-tuning of the laser and camera parameters to optimize the science return. On 11/9 the first science run was started. Unfortunately, in the morning of 11/10 the SODI lasers were found to be off. A power cycling brought both the SODI lasers and cameras back to nominal status but executing the image acquisition command led to the lock-up of SODI. Science runs are on-hold awaiting the outcome of engineering assessment. SOLAR (Solar Monitoring Observatory, ESA):        Since 10/30 we are out of Sun Visibility Window (SVW) and no science measurements have been performed.  After 45P docking, SolACES is still in warm-up configuration in order to protect from degradation of the optics during the upcoming un-/docking events - 28S docking on 11/16, 27S undocking on 11/21.

"Vessel Imaging" is using the Ultrasound scanner on board the ISS to take images of the five different blood vessels in the lower abdomen and in the legs to study what changes occur to cause the blood vessels to be less able to vasoconstrict.  For each vessel, a 5 second scan is performed to observe the blood vessel during several heart beats, followed by a scan where the ultrasound scan-head is tilted to allow a "cut through the blood vessel wall".  The same scans are also performed before flight, and these pre-flight images are used as the baseline to which the in-flight data is compared with.  The images are analyzed to detect any changes in the blood vessel wall properties, such as wall thickness, elasticity or structure, changes in the size of the blood vessel or blood flow (volume) while the crewmember is in orbit.] VIABLE  (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS Payload Touch, NASA):    No report.
