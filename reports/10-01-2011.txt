ISS On-Orbit Status 10/01/11All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – Crew off duty.Today 53 years ago (1958) NASA became operational after its establishment by the National Aeronautics and Space Act on July 29, 1958, replacing its predecessor, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics).FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also during the morning Inspection, the CDR conducted the routine checkup of the circuit breakers & fuses in the DC1 Docking Compartment.      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 & MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 & BPP-36.  MRM2 & MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.] CDR Fossum serviced the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) experiment, checking camera operations during the day and changing the camera battery in the morning and before sleeptime (change required after 8 hrs).  As of yesterday, the BCAT camera flash has issues.  The pictures are not useful and will need to be repeated.  A cable needs to be found and a diagnosis of the camera problems completed.        [The new experiment session is with a Harvard University phase separation sample using a different setup than for the recent crystal samples 9 & 10, mainly requiring an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM timing software, power cables and camera USB cable.  For illumination, the Mini-MagLite and Flash batteries do not need to be changed yet, but the camera will need a freshly charged battery.  After Mike started the run on 9/21 by mixing the sample (#4) for phase separation and taking test photos, the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) software on the SSC-13 laptop began taking pictures of Sample 4 for 13 days at different intervals throughout the run.  This requires camera battery changes twice a day and image check with a battery change once per day.  BCAT-5 is operating in the JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) because some time ago the crew deemed the US Lab too crowded for running it.] Fossum, Volkov & Furukawa joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. FE-5 Furukawa turned on MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) routing and started the playback to the ground of stored video from yesterday’s JAXA EPO (Educational Payload Operation), i.e., the LEGO Bricks Trundle Wheel demo, shutting MPC routing down about 2 hrs later. Also for the JAXA EPO program, Satoshi prepared Report Nr. 11, i.e., writing another short report showing ordinary life in space which, as is expected, will attract children and the general public's attention for future human space exploration.       [JAXA EPO Report 11 is intended for the THE NIKKEI-06 issue, with the topic ("Natural phenomenon").] In the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Furukawa affixed updated labels at the fireports of an HRF (Human Research Facility) power converter and of the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) payload. Sergei performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.        [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] After ground-commanded overnight MDCA (Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus) payload test operations on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab (at S3), Mike Fossum installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the rack to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances). At ~6:10am EDT, Sergei Volkov had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). At ~8:25am EDT, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~8:55am, Fossum & Furukawa conducted a teleconference with MCC-H “PLUTO” flight controllers to discuss the upcoming R&R (Remove & Replace) of the ISL (Integrated Station LAN) network router in Node-2, scheduled on Monday (10/3) for Satoshi.        [Preparations are being made on SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops 7, 12 & 15 to ensure that the crew continues to have the necessary ops products during the activities for the day.  The  Node-2 activities will involve physical R&R of the ISL Router, relocation of SSC-9 & SSC-11 to Node-2 for ISL Router configuration, connecting SSC-9 & SSC-11 by Satoshi, configuring the new ISL Router by ground controllers, disconnecting the two SSC laptops and returning them to their nominal locations, again by FE-5.] Tasks listed for Sergei Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the volcanoes Popocatepetl, Huascaran and Cordon-Kaul, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5).

The first was the Sea Firefly, which is a type of luminous plankton.  Plankton is a mass of organisms which drifts in the pelagic zone of oceans.  Using a stirring wire to keep the water flowing within the water ball, the crewmember added Sea Firefly which glowed for a few minutes.  Satoshi then added fluorescent ink and used UV light to illuminate the water ball, resulting in Sea Firefly appearing as a black silhouette in a dim light of blue ink.   The movement and expansion of the ink on the water ball was captured on video.]  EPO-7 Video (JAXA):     On 9/20, Satoshi completed JAXA Video #2 using the 3D Camera.

MSG-SAME (Microgravity Science Glovebox-Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment):   No report. MSPR (Multi Purpose Small Payload Rack, JAXA):    A USB checkout was performed on 9/29; it was successful. MSL (Materials Science Laboratory, ESA):    At 9/30, the Payload MDM in the US-Lab crashed which led to MSRR automatically going into Shutdown and switching MSL off during the SCA processing.  At that moment the MSL Solidification and Quenching Furnace (SQF) was processing the SETA-2#3 sample at around 1000degC.  Due to the power loss on MSRR-1/MSL, the power to the furnace was cut and the cooling of the facility and the Turbo Pump were switched off.  The recovery of the Payload MDM took some time, after which MSRR-1 was rebooted and MSL brought back up.  The temperatures in the furnace where at around 400 degC at that point.  The MSL Facility was in a safe configuration and cooling down.  Before the facility could reach touch temperature of 49 degC and go into Standby Mode there was a second Payload MDM crash, which caused MSRR to shut MSL off again.  This time however, the facility was almost cool (about 130 degC) and therefore the situation was not critical.  After about an hour the Payload MDM problem was recovered and MSL could be powered on again.  After MSL was back in Standby mode the SETA2#3 activities could be concluded nominally.  The sample processing stopped after 40mm of the planned 50mm processing length and no quenching took place at the end.  What this means in terms of science loss is probably significant, but has to be analyzed by the SETA science team.  MSL engineering team has also to evaluate whether there are further consequences regarding the MSL hardware.

Thanks for your continued good effort in response to our requests.  Your absolutely awesome view of Hurricane Katia off the northeastern US coastline, acquired on 9/9, was published on the NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  Your panoramic view captured much of the circulation of this immense storm well out to sea. Through a break in the clouds, it further offered a view of western Long Island, New York with the sediment plume of the Hudson River muddied by the runoff from the rains of earlier storms Irene and Lee.  Thanks for this marvelous signature shot of our very active Hurricane season this year!” CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Cairo, Egypt (Cairo is the capital city of Egypt and is the largest city in Africa.  It is also one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with an estimated population of 6.8 million people living within the city, and an estimated 10 million living outside the city proper.  Documenting land use and urban boundaries), Mbabane, Swaziland (this small capital city has a population of approximately 95,000 and lies in a wooded highland of the tiny, land-locked nation of Swaziland.  CEO staff has no images of this city in their database), Kerguelen Is., S. Indian Ocean (there may be a break in the clouds for nadir views of this glacier-capped island near the bottom of the orbit.  Cook Glacier on the high west side is the focus of interest), Hurricane Ophelia (DYNAMIC EVENT:  Since yesterday, Tropical Storm Ophelia unexpected strengthened very rapidly to a Category 1 Hurricane and on 9/30 reached Category 3 strength with 100kt winds.  It is now moving northward over the open Atlantic and by the time of this ISS pass should have been very near Bermuda without further strengthening.  Ophelia has remained a compact storm and now exhibits a well-defined eye.  ISS should have been well off the US east coast and approaching the area of Ophelia from the NW.  The crew had a near-nadir pass over the hurricane so short-lens, context views were fine during their approach, but they were to try for more detailed views directly into the eye, if visible, to document the interior eye-wall structure), Central Cuba (looking right of track for context views of land use in central Cuba.  Researchers at Florida International University are conducting an analysis of Cuban land cover change.  Land cover change is indicated by color, change in vegetation, lack of vegetation, industrial and residential land use, etc.), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (HMS Beagle Site: Darwin and the Beagle arrived in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro, presently a city of more than 7 million, in April of 1832 and undertook an expedition inland.  Overlapping views of the city were requested), and Sierra de los Ajos (this club-shaped, roughly north-south range of mountains, is situated in the northeastern part of the state of Sonora Mexico between the mining center of Cananea and the General Lazaro Cardenas Reservoir.  With elevations ranging from about 4,000 to 8,600 feet, the Sierra de los Ajos support an ecologically diverse, alpine-woodland habitat within the Sonoran Desert that includes them in the regional province of scattered highlands known as the Madrean Sky Islands of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States.  CEO is seeking detailed mapping views of this target for baseline and change detection of this unique and threatened habitat).
