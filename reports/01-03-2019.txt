Crystallization of LRRK2 Under Microgravity Conditions-2 (CASIS PCG 16): Today, a crewmember performed Microscope photo operations on the PCG 16 sample card. CASIS PCG 16 evaluates growth of Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein crystals in microgravity. LRRK2 is implicated in Parkinson’s disease, but crystals of the protein grown on Earth are too small and compact to study. Detailed analysis of larger, space-grown crystals can define the protein’s exact shape and morphology and help scientists better understand the disease’s pathology.
Materials International Space Station Experiment 10 (MISSE-10): Today the ground robotic teams continue to install MISSE-10 sample carriers onto the MISSE Flight Facility (MISSE-FF) external platform. MISSE-10-NASA hosts a suite of eight NASA investigations aboard the MISSE-FF.  The MISSE-10 mission exposes 188 samples consisting of radiation protection, radiation detection, laminates, coatings, polymetric, high-efficiency low-mass solar cell systems, composites and additively-manufactured materials to the space environment. 
Northrop Grumman 10 (NG-10) Cygnus Ingress: Today, the crew re-ingressed the Cygnus vehicle after the hatch had been closed for the past several weeks. Ground teams are working to provide cargo unloading messages for the crew.
Cygnus Cargo Operations: The crew completed about 2 hours of Cygnus cargo operations. Today’s tasks had the crew unpacking bags that were temporarily stowed onboard the ISS during the early destow activities.
