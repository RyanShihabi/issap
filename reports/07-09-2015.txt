ISS Reboost: A planned reboost is scheduled at 9:54 pm CDT tonight using 58P thrusters. Delta V will be 1.22 m/s and burn duration is estimated to be 10 minutes and 57 seconds.  The reboost will set up phasing for 43S docking and dynamic operations for future visiting vehicles.
NanoRack Cubesat Deployer (NRCSD) Operations:  Kelly reviewed the procedures and overview and began preparations for a series of deployments of CubeSats from a NRCSD via the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS) beginning next Monday. He then opened the JEM Airlock (AL) inner hatch, extended the slide table into the module, and installed the Cubesat Quad Deployers onto the Multi-Purpose Experiment Platform (MPEP), which is mounted on the slide table.  Preparations are scheduled to be completed tomorrow.
Habitability Video Walk-through Session Postponed: This activity was postponed to allow additional time for NRCSD preparations.
On-Board Training (OBT) ISS Emergency Response: This training session was performed by both the ground and crew to practice ISS Emergency response based on information provided by a simulator.  During the exercise the crew practiced required actions during a depress event, ammonia event and US and Russian segment fire events. Following the training the crew and ground teams had a conference to discuss questions and comments.
