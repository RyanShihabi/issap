Robonaut Setup: Commander (CDR) Swanson gathered tools and set up the Robonaut hardware in preparation for mobility upgrades tomorrow. Robonaut is a dexterous humanoid robot designed with the versatility and dexterity to manipulate hardware, exhibit greater endurance than humans and react safely when bumped or interacted with in a way that was not expected.
Story Time from Space: Flight Engineer (FE-6) Gerst recorded a reading “Max Goes to the Space Station” in German. The recording will be downlinked to the ground and used for educational purposes.
Cargo Operations:  Gerst transferred items to be trashed to the Cygnus vehicle, and unpacked cargo brought to the ISS on 56 Progress.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Tool Deconfiguration: Following yesterday’s direction to stand down on US EVAs 27 and 28 due to a Long Life Battery (LLB) issue, Swanson restowed tools previously configured for the EVAs. He then relocated systems hardware into the Airlock for future Nitrogen/Oxygen Recharge System (NORS) installation.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Swap:  FE-5 Wiseman placed EMU 3011 on the forward EMU Don/Doff Assembly (EDDA) in preparation for Remove & Replace (R&R) of the Fan Pump Separator (FPS) scheduled for next week. He also reviewed FPS R&R procedures.
Audio Bus Coupler (ABC)-4 R&R: The audio system continues to have Passive Built-in Test (PBIT) faults. Following numerous team reviews of system data, it was recommended that ABC-4 in the Node 2 be replaced. Gerst performed the R&R procedure today.  Following successful activation of the new unit, data showed no errors.  Ground teams will continue to monitor performance.
Potable Water Dispenser (PWD) Sample Collect: Wiseman collected ambient PWD water samples for in flight processing, Total Organic Compound Analyzer (TOCA) analysis and post flight analysis.
