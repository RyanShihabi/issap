Reversible Figures (RF): Commander (CDR) Wakata completed his fifth of six sessions of the RF protocol. RF investigates whether the perception of ambiguous perspective-reversible figures, a figure that can normally be seen to change in perspective or orientation in two different ways, is affected by microgravity. A comparison of the perceived reversals during visualization of the figures in crewmembers occurs before, during and after long-term exposure to microgravity. It is expected that measurable, perceptual differences can expand our understanding of human cognitive-perception dynamics by examining the differences that exist between the microgravity environment ISS and that of the Earth’s surface. Understanding whether the perception of ambiguous figures is affected by microgravity might help taking this into account for specific tasks to be executed by humans in microgravity.
Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Education Payloads Operations (EPO): Wakata set up the 4K camera in the Cupola and recorded an educational video to be aired in Japan in April. The video aims to capture Japan at night and any aurorae if possible.
Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Troubleshooting:  Yesterday Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Mastracchio disconnected the pre-treat tank from the Pre-treat and Water Pump and connected new Piping and performed a full Flush Water Tank fill as part of the troubleshooting.  Flush water was detected upstream of the dose pump, which indicated the dose pump was compromised.  Mastraccio then successfully completed a dose pump Remove & Replace (R&R).  The next step in integrated WHC/Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) troubleshooting is to shock the WHC, the downstream hoses, and the Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly (WSTA) to address suspected microbial activity.  Following the shock activity, integrity tests will be performed on the new dose pump at the next scheduled flush water tank fill.
Redesigned Potable Water Dispenser (PWD) Rehydration Station R&R: Earlier this morning, Wakata performed an R&R of the PWD Rehydration Station components with a modified Rehydration Station Kit Assembly. The old unit had experienced issues with water leaking, food accumulation, and broken activation switches. The new unit is a simplified version of the legacy version and is not expected to experience these issues.
Remote Power Control Module (RPCM) LAP51A4A_A RPC 18 Trip:  Yesterday morning, the RPCM LAP51A4A_A RPC 18 tripped. Later in the day, it tripped again after staying closed for ~2.5 hours. Five attempts were made to close it without success. Further attempts to close the RPC were made today without success. Ground teams are monitoring and developing forward plans.  This RPCM feeds a Utility Outlet Panel (UOP) which provides power to the Laboratory (LAB) Robotics Workstation (RWS) Display and Control Panel (DCP) as well as a Portable Computer System (PCS).  The next planned operational use of the RWS will be for SpaceX-3 Dragon capture and berthing.
Regenerative Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) Water Processor Assembly (WPA) Catalytic Reactor Pressurization: On February 24th, the Water Processor Assembly (WPA) had a fault due to a leak into the catalytic reactor which was subsequently replaced. This morning Mastracchio performed a pressure test on the failed reactor to identify leak locations and discovered leaks at multiple seal locations. Teams are reviewing seal design, repair options and number of spare parts on orbit to develop a forward plan.
Lab Robotics Workstation (RWS) Fatal Failure: During power down of the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) yesterday, a Fatal Failure was annunciated.  An attempt to repower the SPDM to keep alive resulted in additional error messages.  Ground controllers proceeded with rebooting the RWS which was successful in clearing the Fatal Failure and other error messages.   SPDM was then successfully powered down.  Canadian Space Agency (CSA) is investigating the Fatal Failure message.
Food Warmer Troubleshooting: Mastracchio repaired the severed ground wire and loose power switch on food warmer #1007. Upon completion of the troubleshooting, he powered up the food warmer and verified functionality. The crew will use the food warmer for a week to verify full functionality.
Extra-Vehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Water Line Vent Tube Assembly (WLVTA) R&R/Swap: During the WLVTA R&R conducted on March 10th, Mastracchio was unable to locate serial number (S/N) 196 for installation in EMU 3005. He discovered that it was installed in EMU 3010. Today, with Wakata’s assistance, Mastracchio removed S/N 196 from 3010 and installed it in 3005. He then installed S/N 185 in 3010 which results in both suits being in the approved configuration prior to SpX-3 docking.
