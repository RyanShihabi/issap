ISS On-Orbit Status 09/02/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, FE-4 Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel. At wake-up, FE-1 Samokutyayev terminated his 5th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  Also at wake-up, FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] After ~3:50am EDT, Ron Garan concluded his 5th (and final) NUTRITION w/Repository 24-hr urine collection period, with samples deposited in MELFI.  Afterwards, Ron underwent the associated generic blood draw, with FE-6 Fossum assisting with the phlebotomy as operator and FE-5 Furukawa taking documentary photography.  FE-3 then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).     [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.] Alex Samokutyayev configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 6th, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] FE-3 Garan & FE-6 Fossum continued their extensive IFM (In-Flight Maintenance) on the HRCS (High Rate Communications System) in the US Lab.  After they rotated the D1 rack forward, Ron routed two PEHG (Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway) cables while Mike replaced the APS ORUs (Automated Payload Switch Orbit Replaceable Units) with upgraded units, first APS-1, and later, after its successful checkout, also APS-2.      [When completed, HRCS will have the new capability to connect to the Ku-band communications unit, is programmable via the Ethernet JSL (Joint Station Local Area Network), and – most importantly – allow for greatly increased payload data throughput.] Furukawa uninstalled & removed the ELPS (Emergency Lighting Power Supplies) in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment).       [For safing the circuits, ground commanding opened both RPCs (Remote Power Controllers) which supplied power to each ELPS.  This, by design, illuminated the EELS (Emergency Egress Lighting Strips) until the ELPS test switch was placed in the Disabled position.  The crew was notified of this ahead of time.]  In support of a ground-conducted leak check of the HRF2 (Human Research Facility 2) vent line in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Satoshi temporarily connected the vent line umbilical to a UIP (Utility Interface Panel) at A4, removing it later again. After reviewing uplinked procedural BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) material, Mike Fossum set up and aimed the NIKON D2Xs digital camera to photograph the BCAT-5 payload, specifically to capture the crystals which have formed in Sample 9.  The images were to be transferred and the camera battery checked.       [For the photography, Mike first had to sweep the Mini-MagLite up and down to change the illumination angle and enable him to view color changes (denoting that crystals are present).  He then was to angle the camera to capture the brightest color peaks within the sample.  The angles of the camera and Mini-MagLite are scientifically important since they enable researchers to calculate the scattering angles produced by the crystals which will give them in-depth information about the structure of the crystals. The best science results will come from photos of very bright and defined crystals along with the corresponding measurements to calculate scattering angles.]  CDR Borisenko continued the 2nd test series of the Russian ASN-M Satellite Navigation System, which requires him to monitor communications between the RSK2 A31p laptop with the test program and the three active ASN NPM-1, NPM-3 & NPM-4 navigation electronics modules every 2 hrs during work hours.       [The objective of the test is to confirm that array configurations for ATV docking in negative Solar Beta angles do not create unacceptable multipathing for the ASN RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System).  Both TRRJs (Thermal Radiator Rotary Joints) and both SARJs (Solar Alpha Rotary Joints) plus the 1B, 2B, 3A & 4A BGAs (Beta Gimbal Assemblies) were placed in Directed position for this test (i.e., not autotrack).  The test will include 4 different array configurations, with periods of autotrack in between for power generation recovery.  The test is planned to be complete late Sunday evening.] Starting a new round of the periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, Andrey worked about an hour in the DC1 Docking Compartment inspecting & cleaning “Group B2” ventilator fans & grilles.  Sasha Samokutyayev cleaned the VD1 & VD2 air ducts in MRM2 “Poisk” module, and Sergei Volkov followed suit in MRM1 “Rassvet”, inspecting & cleaning “Gruppa B2” ventilator fans & grilles Sergei also completed the periodic (normally every Monday) verification of the automatic IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2, as well as the manual update on the non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the recent (8/8) installation of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Later, FE-4 performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] The CDR did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Activities completed by Ron Garan included –Installing the four PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab at S3 to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances),Opening the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Mike Fossum will close the shutters again;   [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use], andConducting another session with the U.S. HMS VIS (Health Maintenance Systems / Visual Acuity) testing program started on 8/15, recording additional test data which use an eye chart for both far & near visual acuity and an eye questionnaire (DCT/Data Collection Tool) to be filled out and downloaded on a laptop for ground access. FE-5 & FE-3 filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Volkov performed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and ensured proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)], Working on the RSS2 laptop, Sasha Samokutyayev uploaded all accumulated science data files of the high-speed RSPI Radio Data Transmission System to the laptop’s storage folders, tagging up with ground specialist. After working out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer, Satoshi performed the periodic “calibration” of the pedals for the VIS (Vibration Isolation System), re-clocking the pedal cranks. At ~4:00am EDT, Andrey Borisenko downlinked the video recorded by the Russian crewmembers on 8/31 for the 65th Anniversary Concert of RCS Energia on 9/9.      [Recorded scenes were to show a cosmonaut with a camcorder filming Earth at the Cupola, and views of Earth recorded with the zoom lens.]  At ~4:20am, the six crewmembers held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~4:35am, Sasha, Andrey & Sergei linked up with TsUP stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~6:55am, the Russian crewmembers supported a PAO TV event, responding to questions from 9-11 graders from Gymnasium #11 in Korolev visiting TsUP to talk with the ISS crew.       [“What made you chose this profession? Do you have any regrets for selecting this profession?  What was the most difficult or unexpected for you upon your first arrival to space?  What were your feelings during lift-off? Did you pray?  What was your first impression when you saw the Earth from space?  What location on Earth looks the most appealing from space?  What are going to do after the flight mission is over?  Do you enjoy floating in weightlessness or you can’t wait to get home soon enough to walk on the ground?  What are the most enjoyable, unpleasant, or, perhaps, sad events during this entire mission?  What was the most important discovery, in your opinion, made using micro gravity?  Did you have any amusing situations happening on orbit?”] At ~11:20am, Andrey, Sergei & Sasha followed up on their earlier video downlink by downlinking PAO TV messages of congratulations to RSC Energia which turned 65 on 8/26.    [The Gala concert dedicated to this event will be held on 9/9 in the Mytishchi Arena Palace.  RSC Energia employees and veterans, Roskosmos management, and ISS IP are going to be present among the attendees.] At ~3:25pm, the crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H. At ~3:55pm, the crew will hold their standard bi-weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office (Peggy Whitson), via S-band S/G-2 audio & phone patch. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).  No exercise reported for FE-6. WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (28-0014L) lists 131 good CWCs (3,044.5 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (31 CWCs with 1,285.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 978.9 L in 24 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 263.2 L in 6 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. Iodinated water (88 CWCs with 1,591.4 L (also 19 expired bags with 345.4 L);  4. condensate water (130.9 L in 8 bags, plus 2 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (37.0 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Lusaka, Zambia (looking right of track for this small capital city.  Visual cues are the light tone of the city area, the Kafue River swamps beyond the city, and center-pivot farmland on the near side of the city), Baghdad, Iraq (looking right of track for the capital city of Iraq.  Overlapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural area with the 180mm lens will provide context for higher-resolution imagery), San Marino, San Marino (trying for a nadir mapping strip to acquire useful views.  The Republic itself is land-locked and is located about 20 miles SW of the Italian coastal city of Rimini.  Best visual cues are Rimini's small but prominent bay and a light-toned river which reaches the sea at this point), and Hurricane Katia (Dynamic Event:  Looking left of the ascending track for Hurricane Katia.  She is expected to slow in forward speed and move to the WNW by the time of ISS closest approach. The hurricane is predicted to intensify to 85 mph wind speed in the next 24 hours and become a major hurricane by Sunday). NOTE:   Tropical Storm Talas continues to batter southern Japan with sustained winds of 100 kph and gusts of up to 130 kph.  The storm is located roughly 750 km south of Kyoto, Japan.  The storm could make landfall Saturday and bring up to 30 cm of rainfall locally.  Landfall is projected to occur during crew sleep period.  Low Pressure in Central Gulf of Mexico – ISS will have a pass that will take it over this area so the crew could see this mass of thunderstorms.  According to the National Hurricane Center, this system could become a tropical depression during the next day or so.  Computer models are still not definitive as to where this system may ultimately impact.
