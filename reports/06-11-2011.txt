ISS On-Orbit Status 06/11/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off-duty day (sleep cycle is back to normal: 2:00am – 5:30pm EDT). FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum began the day with a post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 23rd for Ron, the first for Satoshi & Mike.      [RST will be on the “job jar” task list for Ron, Mike & Satoshi for the next few weeks.  Normally, it is scheduled one day out of every four with the morning test within 2 hours of wakeup and the evening test within 2 hours of sleep; however, in this round the crewmembers may complete as many as they wish.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] The crew joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of uborka house cleaning, CDR Borisenko, FE-1 Samokutyayev & FE-4 Volkov completed regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM. Andrey also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] In the newly arrived Soyuz TMA-02M/27S, FE-4 Volkov worked in the Orbital Module (BO), installing and connecting the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its TA765B/PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit from SM stowage, recycled from an earlier vehicle. The three new station residents, Sergei, Satoshi & Mike, underwent the obligatory CMS Countermeasures Systems) overview which is required of each new crewmember prior to the first physical exercised session.      [The newcomers familiarized himself with location and usage of items such as the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) components (chest strap, transmitter, watch), TVIS & CEVIS PCMCIA memory cards, treadmill harness, ergometer & athletic shoes, and the SBS (Series Bungee System) assembly.  Mike’s & Satoshi’s shoes were reported “MIA”, i.e., could not be located as yet.] To get cleared for exercising after the CMS overview, the newcomers received the usual hands-on training on the use of the exercise apparatus by observing experienced crewmembers – Mike, Sergei & Sergei for ARED, Satoshi & Mike for CEVIS, and Sergei for T2. At ~4:15am EDT, Borisenko, Volkov & Samokutyayev supported a Russian PAO TV downlink, transmitting video messages of greetings and congratulations to two events.     [(1) To tomorrow’s great concert on Red Square in Moscow in celebration of Day of Russia under the name of “Young Russia”, by directive of RF President D.A. Medvedev, broadcast by TV Channel; “Russia 2” (with the ISS crew participating in a simulated interactive exchange);  (2) to the residents of the city of Tambov on the 365th anniversary of the city, to be celebrated tomorrow on the main city square (Volkov graduated from Tambov’s Marina Raskova Airforce Academy in 1995 to become a pilot).] At ~8:50am, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. CDR & FE-3 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Andrey at ~6:35am Ron at ~10:45am. FE-4, FE-5 & FE-6 had their second post-launch PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Sergei at ~12:40pm, Satoshi at ~2:15pm, Mike at ~2:30pm. The “old” crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-1). Jobs listed for Samokutyayev & Borisenko today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens   [uplinked targets were plumes from volcanoes Poas in Costa Rica & Kilauea in the Hawaiian Islands,A session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,Repacking 9 full-size CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) in the RS (Russian Segment) for transfer to the ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) for disposal as per USOS agreement, andPreparing & downlinking more reportages (text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). ISS Reboosts:   Tomorrow (6/12), the ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” will conduct two separate one-burn reboosts of the ISS with its OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters.  Purpose: to deplete ATV2 of remaining propellant and set up phasing for 43P and ULF7:·        Reboost 1:  10:15am EDT: Duration 36 min 06 sec, delta-V 5.2 m/s (17.1 ft/s).
