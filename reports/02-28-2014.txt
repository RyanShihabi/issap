Cube Satellite (CubeSat) Operations:  Overnight the final 7 CubeSats were successfully launched by JAXA Robotic Flight Controllers from two NanoRacks CubeSat Deployers (NRCSDs).  Two Dove CubeSats and ArduSat-2, LitSat-1, LituanicaSat-1, UaPSat-1, and SkyCube CubeSats were launched.  A total of 17 CubeSats have been deployed from the NRCSDs this week. The NRCSDs and Multi-Purpose Experiment Platform (MPEP) were then returned by the JEMRMS to the JEM Airlock Slide Table and brought back into the JEM.  CubeSat format satellites are launched from the ISS for a variety of commercial and national customers.
Aniso Tubule Experiment:  Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Wakata retrieved the Aniso Tubule sample from the light proof bag and placed it on the Multi Purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR) fluorescent microscope for a 48 hour observation.  JAXA’s Aniso Tubule experiment investigates the roles of cortical microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins in gravity-induced growth modification of plant stems.
Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR) Replacement of FIR Avionics Package and White Light Lamp:  FE-3 Hopkins  removed and replaced (R&R) the failed FIR Avionics Package and White Light Lamp. The FIR provides a central location onboard the ISS for fluid physics investigations into such areas as complex fluids (colloids and gels), instabilities (bubbles), interfacial phenomena (wetting and capillary action), and phase changes (boiling and cooling).  Understanding how fluids react in microgravity conditions may lead to improved designs for fuel tanks, water systems, and other fluid-based systems.
Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES)–Slosh Session:  Mastracchio and Wakata conducted the second of two planned Slosh sessions.  The SPHERES-Slosh investigation hardware includes a pill shaped transparent lexan tank, an aluminum support structure with attach points for the SPHERES satellites, and several digital cameras. The Slosh test determines the inertia values about the principal axes of the SPHERES-Slosh experiment, characterizing the performance of the 24 thrusters on the SPHERES-Slosh system given thruster plume impingement and translation, rotation, and pitch open-loop maneuvers to provide benchmarking data for the behavior of fluids in a microgravity environment.
Regenerative Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) Recycle Tank Remove and Replace (R&R):  In support of Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) troubleshooting, Wakata performed an R&R of the recycle tank. The fill of the new recycle tank is planned for tomorrow.  Recycle tanks are reusable bladders that hold resultant brine following waste processing from the UPA.
