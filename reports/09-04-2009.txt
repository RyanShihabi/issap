ISS On-Orbit Status 09/04/09   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Flight Day 8 of STS-128/17A.  Half-day off duty for the crews.   Today’s sleep/wake cycle for the crew: Sleep – 3:30am; wake – 12:00pm; sleep tomorrow – 3:30am.  Mission 17A’s EVA-2 was completed successfully by EV1 Danny Olivas & EV2 Christer Fuglesang in 6h 39min, accomplishing all its objectives plus some get-aheads.  Having begun last night at 6:11pm EDT (delayed about 50 min due to a break in pre-breathe to adjust EV1’s comcap), the spacewalk ended this morning at 12:51am.    [EV1 & EV2 began their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) yesterday morning at ~2:55am in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the  Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe at ~2:55am-4:00am.  Later in the day, following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Olivas & Fuglesang at ~1:05pm-2:15pm after spending the “night” on 10.2 psi, the A/L hatch was closed again by Hernandez & Kopra for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge (~3:45pm) and prebreathe in the EMUs (~4:15pm).  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-1 began at 6:11pm.  The excursion lasted 6h 39m, supported by the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Maneuvering System), operated by PLT Kevin Ford & FE-4 Bob Thirsk.]   During EVA-2, Olivas & Fuglesang –  ·         Relocated the spent ATA (Ammonia Tank Assembly) from the SSRMS temporary stowage location to the Orbiter PLB on the LMC (Lightweight Mission Peculiar Equipment Support Structure Carrier) for return to Earth, ·         Removed the new ATA assembly from the Orbiter PLB and installed it on the P1 truss, and  ·         Installed an FGB (Fixed Grapple Bar) on the S1 truss ATA.    In addition, the following get-ahead tasks were completed:  Installation of thermal covers on the      SSRMS CLA (Capture Latch Assembly) and CLPA (Camera Light Pan &      Tilt Assembly),  Relocation of an APFR (Articulating Portable Foot Restraint) tool      stanchion, and  Replacement of a wire tie on an A/L (Airlock) handrail      to cover a sharp surface edge of an MMOD impact.    When attempting to route & connect a heater cable at the PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3) as a get-ahead task, the spacewalkers discovered that the heater jumper and its routing path appear to be designed for a PMA-3 rotated (“clocked”) 90 deg out of the orientation it is actually in.  The apparent configuration incongruity is under investigation, as are attempts to find an alternate routing path for the given jumper length.  If an alternate path is found, the task will be re-attempted on EVA-3 tomorrow (without heater cabling, using PMA-3 for stowage may encounter a problem with condensation).   After the EVA the crew had some difficulty with EMU water recharge, possibly due to a water bubble in the pump.  EMU specialists are evaluating ways to remove the bubble for a water recharge tomorrow.    All intravehicular tasks previewed here yesterday (09/03) were completed.   Today, before breakfast & exercise, FE-3 Romanenko, FE-4 Thirsk & FE-5 De Winne each completed a 10-min session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), which measures the red cell count of the blood, with one of them acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer, Russian: “Examiner”).  It was the fourth session for the three of them.     [The blood samples were drawn from a finger with a perforator lancet, then centrifuged in two microcapillary tubes in the M-1100 kit's minicentrifuge, and its hematocrit value was read off the tubes with a magnifying glass.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.  After the exam, the data were saved in the IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).]   FE-2 Timothy Kopra closed out the second day of his third (FD60) session with the NASA/JSC experiment NUTRITION w/Repository, finishing his 24-hr urine collections (on or after 12:00pm).  This concluded his final NUTRITION w/Repository session.    [The NUTRITION project is the most comprehensive in-flight study done by NASA to date of human physiologic changes during long-duration space flight.  It includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, nutritional assessments, and hormonal changes, expanding the previous Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) testing in three ways: Addition of in-flight blood & urine collection (made possible by supercold MELFI dewars), normative markers of nutritional assessment, and a return session plus 30-day (R+30) session to allow evaluation of post-flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation.]   In preparation for the arrival of the HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle), FE-Barratt worked in Node-2, installing a power cable in the nadir port vestibule, making sure that it will not get in the way of CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism) activities.   Continuing OGS (Oxygen Generator System) troubleshooting, FE-2 Kopra is to support calibration of the pressure sensor by the ground, after temporarily deactivating and removing the ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts) dosimeter unit to allow OGS rack access.    [Tim’s activities include setting up the video equipment to provide ground personnel with a view of the Multimeter, mating power connections for using the HOCK (Hydrogen ORU Calibration Kit), and preparing the OGS for its installation, followed by hooking up HOCK QDs (Quick Disconnects).  After the sensor calibration, Tim is to tear down the equipment and stow it.]   Starting a new round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, CDR Padalka today has the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok) on his schedule, cleaning the grilles of interior panels 201, 301 & 401, followed by the vent screens of panels 116, 316, 231, 431.   The FE-3 meanwhile is to service the ventilation system in the SM, cleaning the PkhO (Transfer Compartment) air duct and the ventilation grills VAP1, VAP2, VPO1-6, VPO-8, VPO-9, VN1, VN2 & VSU.   FE-5 De Winne took another series of surface samples in the Kibo JPM using MDS (Microbial Detection Sheets) spread out at specific sampling locations (Saibo Rack wall, Node-2/JEM hatch handrail, JPM OA1 diffuser) with cover film open.  After taking documentary photography, the sampling sheets were packed for return.   Mike Barratt will take on the periodic maintenance & visual inspection of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) and its VIS (Vibration Isolation System), guide rails & rollers, greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails & rollers and also evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.   FD8 Midday Meal (“lunch”) is timelined tonight at 7:30pm-8:30pm.   After lunch, the ISS & Shuttle crew will assemble in the SM (Service Module) for posing for the standard joint crew photograph (~8:30pm).   Afterwards (~8:54pm), all crewmembers will join in the traditional Shuttle/Exp-20 Joint Crew News Conference with U.S. media at NASA centers, Canadian media at CSA HQ in St. Hubert, Quebec, and European media at World Television, Stockholm, Sweden, each group for about 12 minutes.   FE-3 Romanenko is scheduled to service the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), verifying proper function of the setup with the LULIN-5 electronics box.    [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (A01-A08) are positioned at their exposure locations, three in the spherical “Phantom” unit on the DC1 panel and five in the SM (two in starboard crew cabin on both sides of the MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) dosimeter detector unit, two under the work table, and one at panel 410).  The deployment locations of the detectors were photo-documented with the NIKON D2X camera and also reported to TsUP via log sheet via OCA.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]   The FE-3 will also do the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   Afterwards, Roman conducts the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.   The CDR is scheduled for the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).   FE-4 Thirsk will perform the regular weekly maintenance on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation & Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices), SLD cables and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time & date values.   Thirsk will also make preparations for the major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the failed Node-2 nadir CBM bolt 4-1 and its passive nut by looking for the spare CBM bolt and nut and prepare them for the R&R (Removal & Replacement) scheduled tomorrow.     [A total of five hours have been timelined for Bob & Tim on FD9 (9/5), with detailed procedures to be uplinked before sleeptime.  After the R&R, the crew will install the CPA-4 (Control Panel Assembly 4), and the ground will then be able to check out the newly installed bolt & nut combination.  The current bolt configuration does not allow MPLM unberthing.]   The FE-1 has another hour of MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) cargo transfers on his schedule, in between off-duty periods, as have CDR Ford, MS1 Forrester & MS2 Hernandez.   Mike Barratt will conduct another session with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), his 6th, by logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and performing the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.     [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]   FE-1 Barratt’s timeline today also shows the periodic maintenance & visual inspection of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) and its VIS (Vibration Isolation System), guide rails & rollers, greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails & rollers and also evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.   Working with Frank De Winne, Barratt is to review detailed procedures for a major IFM on an OGA (Oxygen Generator Assembly) component scheduled tomorrow, during which Mike & Frank will replace the inlet screen of the recently removed Water ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) with a new spare.  A teleconference with ground specialists follows today’s review.    [The 3-hr task will involve removing one QD, releasing the manifold from the ORU and cleaning all components prior to reassembly.  Blockage inside the Water ORU had caused a steady increase in delta-pressure across the recirculation pump.  The ORU replacement on 8/21 solved the problem, and the intent now is to recover the removed unit to make it a viable spare for the future.]   Bob, Frank & Nicole have begun a series of OBT (Onboard Training) sessions for honing their proficiency for HTV arrival.    [Today’s OBT involves self-study, with a 1.5-hr review of procedures, cue cards and time critical operations, followed by a conference with HTV ground controllers & instructors.  Three more Self-Study Sessions are scheduled ahead.]   FE-2-20 Stott again has an hour reserved for herself for general orientation (station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.   Also, at ~2:05am tomorrow morning, Nicole is scheduled for another periodic PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- & Ku-band audio/video.   As a handover activity, Bob Thirsk went with Nicole through an overview of the use of the ARED as an exercise device.   The ISS crew are performing their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-2-20), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).   Afterwards, Bob Thirsk transfers the exercise data files to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).   Shortly before midnight tonight (~11:55pm), Padalka, Stott, Ford, Fuglesang, Hernandez & Olivas are scheduled for another in-depth one-hour review of procedures for the EVA-3 spacewalk, with egress scheduled tomorrow at ~4:54pm EDT.   Afterwards, at ~2:25am, Danny Olivas (EV1) & Christer Fuglesang (EV3) will begin their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) in the A/L with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe at ~2:25a-3:30am.  [Sleep for the ISS crew begins at 3:30am.]  EVA-3 Objectives:  Egress      (4:54pm) Deploy      S3 PAS (Payload Attach System, ~5:24pm) R&R      RGA-2 (Rate Gyro Assembly 2, ~6:54pm) R&R      S0 RPCM (Remote Power Controller Module, ~7:54pm) Install      PMA-3 heater cable (~7:54pm)  [see Note above] Route      Node-3 Avionics Umbilical (~8:39pm) Cleanup      and ingress (~10:59pm).    Following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Danny & Christer tomorrow noon (~12:35pm-1:45pm) after spending the “night” on 10.2 psi, the A/L hatch will be closed again for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge and prebreathe in the EMUs, then egress on EVA-3 at ~4:54pm.  Campout support will be provided by FE-2-20 Stott and MS2 Hernandez.   Sleeptime for the crews will begin tomorrow morning at 3:30am, to last until 12:00pm.
