ISS On-Orbit Status 11/26/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Underway: Week 2 of Increment 34 (three-person crew).  After wakeup, FE-1 Novitskiy performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection and also .   FE-1 also completed the daily reboot of the Russian RS1 & RS2 laptops.  FE-2 Tarelkin rebooted the RSS1 & RSS2 laptops and conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. CDR Ford concluded his 2nd (FD30) NUTRITION/Repository/Pro K urine/blood sampling session with the generic blood collection, with Novitskiy assisting with the phlebotomy as Operator.  Kevin then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI.      [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.] FE-1 & FE-2 performed the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Oleg & Evgeny were joined by Kevin Ford in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device, set up (and later cleaned up and stowed away) by Novitskiy.      [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures.] Tarelkin had ~3 hrs reserved to perform his 2nd session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop. Novitskiy assisted with the gear and took documentary photo/video.      [Evgeny donned the electrode cap, prepared the head for the electrodes, and applied electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] Afterwards, both Oleg & Evgeny underwent their first periodic Russian PZE-MO-3 test for physical fitness evaluation, each spending ~90 min on the TVIS treadmill in unmotorized (manual control) mode and wearing the Kardiokassette KK-2000 belt with three chest electrodes.       [The fitness test, controlled from the RSE-Med laptop, yields ECG (electrocardiogram) readings to the KK-2000 data storage device, later downlinked via the Regul (BSR-TM) payload telemetry channel.  Before the run, the KK-2000 was synchronized with the computer date/time readings.  For the ECG, the crewmember rests for 5 min., then works out on the treadmill, first walking 3 min. up to 3.5 km/h, then running at a slow pace of 5-6 km/h for 2 min, at moderate pace of 6.5 km/h for 2 min, followed by the maximum pace not exceeding 10 km/h for 1 min, then walking again at gradually decreasing pace to 3.5 km/h]. CDR Ford completed another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.      [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] Later, the CDR took air samples with new GSCs (Grab Sample Containers) in the center of SM (#2116), Lab (#2107), and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module, #2007), sequenced with the AQM sampling for postflight comparison.    [GSC samples are to be taken 1-3 hrs after AQM start.] Kevin also deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.    [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] Working in ESA’s COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), the CDR performed outfitting by installing single-stowage locker inserts in three ER3 (EXPRESS Rack 3) lockers (1, 5, 6) and stowing six vent covers. Oleg had 3 hrs set aside for maintenance/repair work on interior panel 329 in the SM, installing a large number of cover sheets and tagging up with ground specialists on S-band. Evgeny assisted part of the time. The task will be continued tomorrow. Afterwards, the two Russian Flight Engineers had ~1.5 hrs for conducting the periodic extensive audit/inventory of SLG personal hygiene items (e.g., SLG-D wet & dry towels and wet procedures kits) in the RS (Russian Segment). After filling in tables, the crew was to downlink the file via OCA. Oleg supported the overnight test of the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) in the SM by copying the test data collected overnight from the RSE-SLS A31p laptop to the RSS2 laptop for data downlink and log file dump. Before sleeptime tonight, FE-1 will turn on the RSE-LCS laptop again to commence recording for TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communication System). After gathering the necessary equipment, including looking for (and finding) a “lost” spare filter, CDR Ford performed periodic air filter R&R (removal & replacement) on the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment).     [WHC was unavailable for use during the R&R.] Later, Kevin completed routine maintenance on the WRS (Water Recovery System) by filling a CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine) with iodinated water from the WPA PWD Water Processor Assembly Potable Water Dispenser) Aux Port to assist with water balance, using the H2O transfer common hose.   [Estimated offload time: ~21 min; quantity: 8.9L.] Oleg completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Evgeny took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Kevin Ford had ~1hr 45min for performing the periodic hatch seal inspection/cleaning on 9 (out of 18) USOS (US Segment) module hatches. Also, photographs were to be taken of the hatch seal beads of any one of the inspected 9 hatches prior to their cleaning.       [These hatches are being inspected after 270 days inspection interval. The remaining 9 hatches will be inspected at the end of their current 180-day interval. The CDR today checked the hatches at JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment) Nadir, JPM Ovhd & Stbd, COL, Node-2 Port & Stbd, PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), A/L IV (Airlock Intravehicular), and Node-3 Stbd.] Before Presleep (~2:30pm EST), Ford powers up the MPC and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Kevin turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Before sleeptime, Novitskiy initiates charging the battery of the TEKh-62 ALBEDO which uses the FSS Photo Spectrum System at an SM window. The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1). Tasks listed for Evgeny & Oleg on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U  to record target sites on the Earth surface, andA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
