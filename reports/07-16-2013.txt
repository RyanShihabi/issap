New Status:
USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #23: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy (EV-1) and FE-5 Parmitano (EV-2) completed a 1 hour 32 minute  EVA with FE-6 Nyberg IVA support. The crew successfully performed the Z1-YJumper install Part 2 and the FGB PDGF 1553 cable final connections. The MLM Ethernet cable was secured to a Node 1 handrail.  Due to a buildup of water in Parmitano’s helmet, the EVA was terminated early. The crew returned safely to the Airlock and following a nominal repress they egressed their suits and conducted an inspection. EVA specialists are assessing the cause and source of water in the suit.
Water Processor Assembly (WPA) Status: Engineering teams met yesterday to discuss the WPA delta pressure issue. They determined that the next most likely cause is a clogged Mostly Liquid Separator (MLS) Check Valve. The valve is relatively easy to remove but if there is air in the system from the Particulate Filter R&R last Friday there is a risk that the MLS could over pressurize. If there is air in the system, it should be completely dissolved within a week based on current WPA operations. Teams will meet again next week to discuss removing and replacing the check valve.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS and maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) into position for the EVA task to remove and replace the Lens Cover on the SSRMS End-B Camera Light Pan Tilt Unit (PTU) Assembly (CLPA).  It was anticipated that changing the Lens Covers would help determine if the haziness of the image from the CLPA is being caused by the Lens Cover, the CLPA itself or a combination of the two.  Following termination of the EVA and Cassidy’s and Parmitano’s re-entry of the ISS, Robotics Ground Controllers maneuvered the SSRMS back to a park position.  MSS performance was nominal.
