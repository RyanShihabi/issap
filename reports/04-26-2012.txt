ISS On-Orbit Status 04/26/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Light-duty day for the crew: Sleep cycle shift to accommodate tomorrow morning’s Soyuz 28S undocking (7:03am EDT):·        Wake 1 (this morning):  2:00am·        Nap:                             9:00am·        Wake 2 (today):                        3:30pm·        Undock (tomorrow):      7:03am·        Sleep (tomorrow):         9:00am·        Wake 3 (4/28):              2:00am (normal)Upon wakeup, FE-3 Dan Burbank, FE-5 André Kuipers & FE-6 Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 44th Dan, the 38th for André & Don.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] FE-1 Shkaplerov & FE-4 Kononenko began their day with the installation of the ASP MGK pressurized hatch sealing drive of the SSVP Docking & Internal Transfer Mechanism on the MRM2 hatch sealing mechanism.       [The relative new the device, added last November, enables hook opening with MRM2 & Soyuz hatches plus PEV (Pressure Equalization Valves, KVDs) closed, and Soyuz on standalone power.] Afterwards, Anton spent most of his remaining hours on ISS with packing cargo on Soyuz 28S, both return cargo in the SU Descent Capsule and discarded material for disposal in the BO Orbital Module.  Dan assisted with the loading/packing of US return cargo.   For return to Earth, Anatoly & Oleg transferred the Russian biotechnology experiments BIO-1 and, BTKh-6,7 to 28S, with photo and video documentation. Afterwards, Ivanishin prepared copies of the structural dynamics measurements obtained by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 Rassvet on HDD (Hard Disk Drive) for return on 28S. Anatoly also worked on the 28S Descent Capsule crew console, issuing commands to test the TMI (telemetry) connection to mobile devices on the island of Crete which will cover part of the descent. FE-3 Burbank retrieved & stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies which Don had deployed on 4/24 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.       [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] Dan also supported POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center)/Huntsville on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) by uninstalling & removing the three protective alignment guides from the rack, re-engaging the snubber pins and locking the safety pins to allow the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be active before begin of ground-commanded CIR operations requiring a microgravity environment.  Don Pettit checked the DECLIC (Device for the Study of Critical Liquids & Crystallization) data cable and its connectors at the ER7 (EXPRESS Rack 7).      [DECLIC had been transferred with its power & data cables from ER4 to a locker in ER7 on 4/16 by Burbank.  The French (CNES)/NASA-sponsored DECLIC is a multi-user facility to investigate low & high temperature critical fluids behavior, chemical reactivity in supercritical water, directional solidification of transparent alloys, and more generally transparent media under micro-gravity environment. André Kuipers collected the 17 Soyuz 28S-delivered RBO-3 MATRYOSHKA-R PADLE (Passive Area Dosimeters for Lifescience Experiment) radiation dosimeters from the walls of the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and JPL (JEM Pressurized Logistics Segment) and turned them over to Anatoly & Anton who took photographs of the transfer and packed them for return to Earth on 28S. Next, FE-5 activated radiation dosimetry data collection with the ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts)-Shield. At ~8:00am EDT, Kuipers conducted the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with COL-CC at Oberpfaffenhofen/Germany.  At ~9:00am EDT, the entire crew rested for a 6.5-hr “napping” period which ended at 3:30pm. First thing after the nap, prior to eating, drinking & brushing teeth, FE-3 Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit are to conduct another liquid saliva sample collection on the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol.  Later in the day, Dan, Don & André also complete the IMMUNE blood sample draws, assisting each other as Operator and taking documentary photography.  Following the blood draws, the full blood tubes are temp stowed in the blood collection kit and later packed together with the saliva samples on the Soyuz for return to ground.       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] FE-2 Ivanishin will be working in the TMA-22 spacecraft’s Orbital Module (BO), disconnecting & taking out the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit, for stowage and recycling in a future vehicle. FE-6 Pettit removes the JAXA PCG (Protein Crystal Growth) canister bag from the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) Micro-g IU (Incubator Unit) and the TKhN-9 canister from the PCRF (Protein Crystallization Research Facility).  Don then hands the TkhN-9 KRISTALLIZATOR over to Anatoly for inspection and transfer to 28S while Anton photo documented the activities. Anatoly moves the Russian biotech experiments BTKh-40 & BTKh-14 to the Soyuz spacecraft, as well as the samples of the MBI-29 IMMUNO (Neuroendocrine & Immune Responses in Humans During & After Long Term Stay at ISS) payload which had been stored in MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1). CDR Kononenko will assist the ground in the pre-undocking deactivation of the Elektron oxygen generator by performing the standard purge of the Elektron with N2 (nitrogen), controlled from laptop. Oleg will also bring the ODF (Operation Data File) books up to day by deploying new files delivered on Progress 47P. FE-6 Pettit is to retrieve a spare RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) from PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) stowage and then changes out the full RFTA in the Node-3 WRS-2 (Water Recovery System) Rack 2, stowing the used unit.      [RFTAs collect the substances cleaned from the pretreated urine by the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) as it turns it into water.  They need to be replaced when filled and constitute an important resupply item from the ground.] Dan Burbank will retrieve US experiment containers with preserved samples and hand them over to Anton & Anatoly for stowage on Soyuz, including –Four small ESA cartridges at -19°C from MELFI-3 for frozen return,All SOLO and CARD experiment samples from MELFI 1 for frozen return and ROALD2 EC Pouch & Mini ESA Thermal Container. At ~9:30pm, FE-1 Shkaplerov will downlink the standard “Loading Complete” report, then take documentary photo/video of the SA hatch cover and downlinks the files for ground inspection. In the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Kuipers will perform the periodic inspection and internal cleaning of the RGSH (Return Grid Sensor Housing), which has to be removed to get access to the internal sensors and brackets with the vacuum cleaner. Afterwards, André configures the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware plus MBS (Mixing Bag System) in COL, including calibrating the PPFS software and checking instruments, and then conducts his 4th session with the VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, integrated with Thermolab (head sensors).  After the session, André powers down, cleans up & partially stows the equipment, then downloads the data to a PCS laptop.       [The experiment VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.] Later, André completes his weekly task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space.In the Lab, Kuipers accesses the NanoRacks Modules and collects data for subsequent transfer to the ER-1 (EXPRESS Rack 1) laptop. Pettit & Kuipers again have time reserved for transferring & pre-packing return cargo on the SpaceX Dragon capsule after its arrival. Anatoly Ivanishin is to conduct the regular transfer of US condensate water from CWC (Contingency Water Container, #1000) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed for gas/liquid separation, i.e., to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the Elektron’s BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.] Don & André will fill out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), their 13th.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] FE-5 also conducts the weekly 10-min. CWC (Collapsible Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      WRM Update:     A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.    [The current card (29-0008T) lists 16 CWCs (183.3 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (2 CWCs with 47.5 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria;  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (7 CWCs with 121.8 L; and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Pettit has another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journals on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] The traditional Crew Farewell ceremony, transmitted via PAO TV to the ground, is scheduled for ~11:20pm EDT. Shortly afterwards, CDR Kononenko will configure the Russian STTS onboard comm system to its “undocked” mode. Preparations for tomorrow morning’s undocking will pick up momentum at ~11:45pm with Shkaplerov performing a communications check from the 28S spacecraft to RGS (Russian Groundsite) via VHF (Very High Frequency) and the activation of the Soyuz spacecraft by Anton & Anatoly at ~12:00 midnight. Russian thrusters will be disabled from ~12:30am-12:45am due to load constraints for hatch closure and the removal, by Oleg, of the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking & internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) which rigidized the joint at the MRM2 nadir port. After Crew Farewell, Dan, Anton & Anatoly will enter the Soyuz at ~1:00am-1:20am, covered by live PAO TV. Next, with the Soyuz spacecraft’s gas analyzer (GA) running, Shkaplerov inside MRM2 and Kuipers & Pettit outside close MRM2 & Soyuz hatches.  The departing Soyuz crew then starts the standard one-hour leak check on the Soyuz-to-Rassvet vestibule (1:20am-2:20am). After attitude control authority handover to the RS MCS (Russian Segment Motion Control System) at ~3:15am, the ISS will maneuver to undock attitude.  The returning crew will then perform Sokol suit leak checks and depressurize the BO Orbital Module by 150 mmHg for leak checking the SA-BO hatch.  Next, they will don their Kentavr g-suits, biomed belts and Sokol space suits.   ISS goes into Free Drift at 4:14am-4:20am for MRM2 hooks opening and Soyuz undocking at ~4:03am.  Attitude control returns to US Momentum Management with CMGs (Control Moment Gyros) at ~7:40am EDT. With the undocking of Soyuz 28S, Increment 30 ends and Inc-31 begins. Activities scheduled for CDR Kononenko immediately after undocking are –Monitoring 28S departure and shooting photography of the Soyuz Docking Assembly from SM window #7 after separation, for ground inspection for cleanliness (i.e., no seal debris),Manually closing the KVD/PEV (Pressure Equalization Valve) between the MRM2 Poisk module and its nadir docking port vestibule,Downlinking the videos taken by him of the Soyuz/MRM2 hatch interface prior to hatch closure and of the hatch closing,Readied, activated/monitored and later closed out the Russian “Istochnik-M” (source, spring) telemetry reception & recording (SPR TMI) system in the SM during the Soyuz re-entry for the trimodule separation at 7:18:07am;   [Istochnik-M enables the ISS to receive data telemetered from Soyuz spacecraft during return to Earth and record it on the SPR telemetry system.  The equipment, including the Istochnik TM station, power amplifiers, power supply, USB software sticks and cables, captures the telemetry through the “Sputnik” amateur (ham) radio antenna and transfers it to a laptop display where the crew is able to immediately tell if a good separation of the three Soyuz modules occurred during Soyuz descent operations],  andReturning the STTS comm system to its post-undocking configuration. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  28S Descent Timeline Overview:If everything proceeds nominally, the return to Earth of the TMA-22 spacecraft tomorrow morning (4/27) will proceed along the following approximate event sequence (all times EDT):ISS Control Handover to RS --- 3:15am;Orbital (local) Sunrise --- 3:40:30am;Undock --- 4:18:30am;Orbital (local) Sunset --- 4:37:22amDeorbit Burn start (delta-V 115.2 m/sec) --- 6:49:37am; Deorbit Burn complete --- 6:53:55am;Trimodule Separation (~140 km alt) --- 7:18:07am;Atmospheric entry (101.8 km alt, with ~170 m/sec) --- 7:21:28am;Entry Guidance start (81.9 km alt) --- 7:23:24am;Maximum G-load (34.5 km alt) --- 7:28:51amParachute deploy command (10.7 km alt) --- 7:30:51am; 28S Landing (DO2) --- ~7:45am EDT; ~2:45pm Moscow; 5:45pm local Kazakhstan; (loc. 51deg01min N, 67deg 10min E; 87 km from Arkalyk). Note: Kazakhstan time = GMT+6h; = EDT+10h.  Moscow DMT time = EDT+7h.] What the Soyuz TMA-22/28S crew will experience during their reentry/descent tonight: For the reentry, Anton, Dan & Anatoly will wear the Russian Kentavr anti-G suit under their Sokol suits.    [The Kentavr garment is a protective anti-g suit ensemble to facilitate the return of a long-duration crewmember into the Earth gravity.  Consisting of shorts, gaiters, underpants, jersey and socks, it acts as countermeasure for circulatory disturbance, prevents crewmember from overloading during descent and increases orthostatic tolerance during post-flight adaptation.  Russian crewmembers are also advised to ingest fluid-electrolyte additives, viz., three sodium chloride tablets during breakfast and after the midday meal, each time with 300 ml of fluid, and two pills during the meal aboard Soyuz before deorbit.] Before descent: Special attention will be paid to the need for careful donning of the medical belt with sensors and securing tight contact between sensors and body.  ECG electrodes are applied with paste.  Kentavr suits must have snug fit in lower body and calves. During preparation for descent, before atmosphere reentry, crewmembers settle down comfortably in the Kazbek couches, fasten the harness belts, securing tight contact between body and the seat liner in the couch.During de-orbit:Dust particles starting to sink in the Descent Module (SA) cabin is the first indication of atmosphere reentry and beginning of G-load effect.  From that time on, special attention is required as the loads increase rapidly. Under G-load effects during atmosphere reentry the crew expects the following experience: Sensation of G-load pressure on the body, heaviness of the body, labored breathing and speech. These are normal sensations, and the advice is to "take them coolly".  In case of the feeling of a lump in the throat, this is no cause to "be nervous".  This is frequent and should not be fought.  Best is to "try not to swallow and talk at this moment".  Crew should check vision and, if any disturbances occur, create additional tension of abdominal pressure and leg muscles (strain abdomen by pulling in), in addition to the Kentavr anti-G suit. During deployment of pilot parachute (0.62 & 4.5 square meters), drogue chute (16 sq.m.) and main (518 sq.m.) chutes the impact accelerations will be perceived as a "strong jolt".  No reason to become concerned about this but one should be prepared that during the parachutes deployment and change ("rehook") of prime parachute to symmetrical suspension, swinging and spinning motion of the SA occurs, which involves vestibular (middle ear) irritations.It is important to tighten restrain system to fasten pelvis and pectoral arch. Vestibular irritation can occur in the form of different referred sensations such as vertigo, hyperhidrosis, postural illusions, general discomfort and nausea.  To prevent vestibular irritation the crew should "limit head movement and eyes movement", as well as fix their sight on a stationary object.Just before the landing (softened by six small rocket engines behind the heat shield): Crew will be prepared for the vehicle impact with the ground, with their bodies fixed along the surface of the seat liner in advance and braced for ground impact.  "Special attention should be paid to arm fixation to avoid the elbow and hand squat" (instruction). Landing speed: ~9.9 m/sec.After landing: Crew should not get up quickly from their seats to leave the SA.  They were advised to stay in the couch for several minutes and only then stand up.  In doing that, they should limit head and eyes movement and avoid excessive motions, proceeding slowly.  Their body should not take up earth gravity in the upright position too quickly.
