ISS On-Orbit Status 06/25/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off-duty day. The six crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] FE-1 Samokutyayev conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module).      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~8:15am EDT, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. FE-3 Garan & FE-6 Fossum, as handover activity, conducted the quarterly T2/COLBERT treadmill maintenance inspection, checking the SBS (Series Bungee System) bungees, rack centering, components, pin alignment, and the snubber jam nut witness marks.     [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- & Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm; their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.] FE-4 Volkov tended the current experiment with the Russian/German KPT-21 Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall/PK-3+) payload, running in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, by checking twice the hermeticity of the evacuated EB vacuum chamber.  Any pressure increase above the vacuum should stay within 5 mmHg.    [Main objective of PK-3 is to study wave propagation and dispersion ratio in a dust plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber, at a specified power of HF discharge, pressure, and a varied number of particles.] FE-5 Furukawa performed a VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activity, having chosen Part 1 of the 2nd series of the CsPINs (Dynamism of Auxin Efflux Facilitators responsible for Gravity-regulated Growth and Development in Cucumber) experiment.  Part 2 is scheduled tomorrow (6/26).        [The experiment is a two-day task, with incubation being time-critical:  The sample must be returned on ULF7 within 30 days after performing the experiment.  CsPINs studies the phenomenon of tropism, i.e., the growth or turning movement of a biological organism, usually a plant, in response to an environmental stimulus.  Specifically focusing on gravity, the new JAXA experiment investigates how plants sense gravity as an environmental signal and use it for governing their morphology and growth orientation.  CsPINs plays an important role in the regulation of gravity-dependent redistribution of auxin (a class of plant hormones) and thereby controls gravimorphogenesis (peg formation) in cucumber (Cucmis sativus L.) seedlings.  Gravitropism also interferes with hydrotropism in cucumber roots, in which the dynamism of these facilitators may also play a role.  Cucumber seedlings are used to analyze the effect of gravity on the expressions of CsPINs and unravel their contributions to peg formation.  Hydrotropism is differentiated from gravitropism in roots, and the expressions of CsPINs are compared to determine the interacting mechanism between the two tropisms.]  At ~8:50am, Andrey, Sasha & Sergei used the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) for a ham radio session with the participants of the International Youth Meeting “АТР-2011. Altai. Points of Growth” (about 300 participants, all prospective managers in the area of politics, business, culture and art. Two tasks added today to the voluntary US “Job Jar” task list are –·        Deploying a “wanted poster” for a missing HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) USB adapter (if found, it will allow the transfer of all data on the crew’s HRM watch directly to an SSC), and·        Conducting a laptop survey to identify deployed unused laptops.  Jobs listed for Samokutyayev, Borisenko & Volkov today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –·        Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens   [uplinked targets were Bear Glacier, Aral Sea Altai Mountains, Novorossiysk waters, Tuapse waters, Adler, Krasnaya Polyana, Laganakskoe plateau, Olga waters, Kursk steppe, Lipetsk Metallurgical & River Don],·        A session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,·        A photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining photo & video data on oceanic color bloom patterns in the Central-Eastern & South-Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, and·        Preparing & downlinking more reportages (text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR). WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (28-0014C) lists 101 good CWCs (2,282.2 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (21 CWCs with 846.4 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 562.2 L in 14 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (68 CWCs with 1,241.3 L (also 36 expired or leaking bags with 658.8 L);  4. condensate water (158.2 L in 7 bags, plus 3 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (36.3 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Weekly Science Update (Expedition Twenty-Seven/Twenty-Eight -- Week 13) 2D NANO Template (JAXA):    On 6/14 started Experiment 1.

CSI-3/CGBA-5 (CGBA Science Insert #2/Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5):    The PD and PI greatly appreciated the HD video.  The video allowed us to see more clearly, activity within the habitat as well as overall status of the habitat, spider and flies.  We did see both spiders on your video and both look as expected.  The spider towards the front of CGBA is Gladys and the spider towards the back of CGBA is Esmerelda.  There is only one spider within each habitat.  The spiders are growing and as they grow they molt or shed their old skin for a new one.  The "extra" spiders you are seeing in the habitat are the spiders' old skin or exoskeleton.  Because each spider is getting quite large, these molts now look like spiders.  Gladys has molted twice and Esmerelda three times.  Esmerelda is the bigger spider at the moment.It appeared that both spiders did get 5-10 fruit flies released into their habitat during today's feeding.   Because the spiders are larger, they require more food, thus the feedings will continue to be important to the overall health of the spiders.  The feedings also decrease the number of flies within the fly habitats which helps extend the life of the fruit fly colony - i.e. less flies, less food is eaten by the flies and fly larvae.  At this time, the fruit fly colonies continue to look healthy.  There are fruit fly larvae and flies within the smaller fly habitats.  We continue to collect video of the fruit fly movement.  We are now looking at 3rd or 4th generation flies born in space that have never experienced gravity.Web spinning - the spiders continue to spin unique webs in space.  Esmerelda appears to be a more prolific web spinner than Gladys.  Because of this, Esmerelda catches more food, thus one of the reasons she is growing at a faster rate.  The webs the spiders are spinning are often circular.  On the ground, the spiders only spin a 1/2 circle and never a full circle like the spiders are doing in space.  In addition, the spiders in space sit on their webs in all directions.  That is, they do not know "up" or "down."  On the ground the spiders always sit at the top of their webs facing down towards the largest portion of their web.Looking forward into the month of July - we are trying to keep both spiders and fruit flies alive for return on STS-135.  If the fly colony continues until that time, the live flies will be 5th or 6th generation flies born in space that have never experienced a 1g environment.    For the spiders, since both were young juveniles when launched into space and now are close to being fully mature, it will be valuable, scientifically, to examine how they now re-adapt (spin webs) on the ground i.e. will they now spin a web that is typical of this type of spider since they did not do this in space.  Additionally, since a spider's exoskeleton is like "bone,"  it will be of scientific interest to investigate how the spider, from a mobility perspective,  reacts in gravity since their exoskeletons they will have developed completely in space.
