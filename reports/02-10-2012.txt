ISS On-Orbit Status 02/10/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup this morning (~1:00am EST), FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 21st for both.         [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] André Kuipers concluded his SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment session by collecting the final urine sample in the morning and later placing his and Dan Burbank’s samples in MELFI-1 (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) Dewar 2/Tray C.         [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included), the crewmember is ingesting one of two special diets (low salt & high salt content).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.] FE-1 Shkaplerov terminated his 5th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-6 Pettit serviced the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 4 once every two hours for seven days.  Crew performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike Fossum’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.] Continuing the paced preparations for the Orlan EVA-30 spacewalk next week (2/16) and the suited dry-run on Tuesday (2/14), FE-4 Kononenko & FE1 Shkaplerov prepared and installed Orlan Add-On Hardware, then took photographs of the Orlan gear for downlink, followed by ground specialist tagup. Kononenko also –Consolidated medical supplies by unstowing medical kits (NP-2 Emergency Medical Kit A82, SS Cardiovascular Remedies Kit A167 & Replacement pack A180) from the SM Medlocker and setting them up in the SM PkhO (Transfer Compartment),Retrieved the AB Onboard First Aid Kit A79 from Soyuz 29S for placing it in the DC1 airlock, andInstalled two BNP Portable Repress O2 Tanks, one in the SM RO (Working Compartment), the other in DC1. Later, Oleg readied Progress M-14M/46P at the DC1 nadir port for undocking if required in an EVA-30 ingress contingency.  Steps included –Installing the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC1 nadir port  [the StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB, MRM2 and DC1],Activating the spacecraft’s electronics and taking out the ventilation/heating air duct; Closing the hatches; Removing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking & internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) which rigidized the joint,Starting, with Anton, the standard one-hour leak checking of the SU docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and DC1, andDownlinking Oleg’s formal report on loading completion and the video depicting the close-out activities, for review by ground specialists.    [During hatch closure, leak checking and initial clamp installation, Russian thrusters were inhibited due to load constraints from ~9:00am – 10:40am EST.] Also for the spacewalk, Anatoly Ivanishin performed pre-EVA preventive maintenance on the DC1 ventilation system, replacing the PF1 & PF2 dust filter cartridges and cleaning the V1 & V2 fan screens. In the SM, Ivanishin cleaned the numerous Group A ventilator fans & grilles, and then moved on to the MRM1 Rassvet module where he replaced the SKPF1 & SKPF2 dust filters and cleaned the GZhT gas-liquid heat exchanger grill, then updated the IMS (Inventory Management System) database. Anton Shkaplerov & Oleg Kononenko undertook their first training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the Russian VELO ergometer, assisting each other in turn as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).     [The 50-min assessment, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground site (DO16, 11:10am-11:34am; DO1, 12:45pm-1:09pm), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, today set at -20, -25, -30 and -35mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] Anton also undertook his 2nd session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.         [Ivanishin stood by to assist Anton in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit worked several hours in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), cleaning up its endcone area to enable creation of a trash staging area prior to Progress loading.       [The activity, requiring 8 hrs total, has the crew relocate items per an uplinked tabular listing, cleaning out locker spaces to make room, and reporting final results to MCC-Houston.] Dan Burbank had ~1h 40m reserved for supporting the JAXA EPO (Education Program Operation) Space Musical Instruments, playing two innovative instruments (Ellipsoid Bell & Fractal Bell) with three takes (in front of a background sheet attached to the JPM Airlock, in front of the JPM window  and freely in the module).  The video recording was then downlinked to SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center/Tsukuba).       [Purpose of the Japanese EPO “Space Musical Instruments” is to develop a kind of new space musical instruments for the future through playing musical instruments and to consider how to make new sounds with them, which could lead to some new communication tools in space.] Afterwards, Dan retrieved the partially assembled Amine Swingbed hardware from the PMM, set up the video camcorder for live coverage, then performed troubleshooting on the swing valve motor circuitry which malfunctioned on 1/13/12.        [Instead of moving from its Isolation position to Flow position, the valve only moved for 0.33 sec, then stopped, after a fuse has blown in the Amine Swingbed Control Unit.  Dan’s activities today were to verify valve motor wiring, check for shorts, verify continuity & shorts in the cabling, etc., both for unpowered and powered payload.   Background: The Amine Swingbed, consisting of the Amine Swingbed, Controller with Vacuum Line, Amine Swingbed Mounting Plate, Amine Swingbed Mounting Hardware, Strain Relief Mounting Hardware, Electrostatic Symbol Decal) is a prototype of the CO2 and moisture control technology to be used in the Orion MPCV (Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle).  It consists of two multilayer sorbent beds in one unit, with a single valve to alternate (“swing”) them between adsorbing from cabin air and desorbing to space vacuum.  The system pulls air from the ISS atmosphere, dries it (and heats it) with a desiccant wheel, cools it back down, scrubs most of the CO2 and remaining water vapor out, then reheats the scrubbed air, rehumidifies it (and recools it) with the desiccant wheel, then returns the air to the cabin.  Periodically (every 6 - 30 min) the sorbent beds are swapped to expose the freshly vacuum-desorbed bed to the process stream and start regenerating the CO2-laden bed.  During bed swap transitions, additional air is saved by equalizing the bed about to be vented with a compressor-evacuated volume.  This will be the first test of the Amine Swingbed payload.  Its purpose is to determine if a vacuum-regenerated amine system can effectively remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the ISS atmosphere using a smaller more efficient vacuum regeneration system.  A similar technology (amine-based pressure swing adsorption) was used on the Shuttle Extended Duration Orbiter, in the form of the RCRS (Regenerative Carbon Dioxide Removal System). The Amine Swingbed payload uses an amine with a significantly greater capacity for CO2 than the RCRS.  Amines are organic compounds and functional groups that contain a basic nitrogen atom with two “lone pair” electrons.  They are derivatives of ammonia (NH3) wherein one or more of the hydrogen atoms (H) have been replaced by a substituent such as an alkyl or aryl group.  Important amines include amino acids, biogenic amines, trimethylamine, and aniline.  Inorganic derivatives of ammonia are also called ammonia, such as chloramine (NClH2).] Working in the SM, Don Pettit performed troubleshooting on the failed RSU (Remote Sensor Unit) of the US IWIS (Internal Wireless Integrated System) by checking units and, if necessary, swapping the RSU (#1029) with another unit (#1027).     [Objective:  To remedy Z-Channel data-corruption in the IWIS Triaxial Accelerometer in the SM, and determine if the problem is the IWIS RSU or the Accelerometer, by disconnecting the IWIS accelerometer cable and reconnecting it to the IWIS RSU.  If necessary, the IWIS RSU in the SM was to be replaced with the "Roving" RSU in Node-1 (#1027).] André Kuipers conducted his weekly task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space. On MCC-Houston Go, FE-5 later was to load two SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops (#7 & #15) from a Load Image Server which the ground configured beforehand from SSC-8.      [After the ground got SSC-8 ready, André initiated the reload of the (wired) laptops.  Afterwards, the three SSCs were to be restored to their original configuration by ground uplinking.] André also had another 1h 35min for unpacking & stowing US cargo delivered on Progress 45P. In the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment), Dan verified presence of updated cue cards for normal operation and malfunction procedures, then removed outdated cue cards and documented the current situation. FE-5 & FE-6 filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), André’s & Don’s 6th.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~3:20am EST, Burbank, Ivanishin, Shkaplerov, Kuipers, Kononenko & Pettit held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~3:35am, Anton, Oleg & Anatoly linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~9:00am, André conducted the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with COL-CC at Oberpfaffenhofen/Germany.  At ~2:35pm, the crew was scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H. Pettit performed a session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).    [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Papandayan volcano, the Hudson volcano and the glaciers of Patagonia,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) target uplinked for today was Aurora Borealis, Canada (AURORAMAX.    Two opportunities.  Looking left for ~10 mins for this CSA target.  NOAA estimates a 40% chance of polar geomagnetic activity.  If using camera in “video” mode, the crew was to ensure that aim is sufficiently north [left} to acquire optimum images).
