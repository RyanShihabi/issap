ISS On-Orbit Status 07/14/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday �C Crew light duty day. After wakeup, Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Joe Acaba completed his regular session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, his 21st time.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Padalka, Revin & Acaba joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] Sergei completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Joe shut down the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) camera operations at the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) and stowed the equipment. At ~8:45am EDT, the entire crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3) and VELO cycle ergometer with load trainer (CDR).  Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-Two �C Week 2. 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD Shielding (NASA/ASI):     Session #1 is on-going.  To date, 34 cumulative days of measurements have been performed. Session#1 must be pursued for a minimum of 40-60 cumulative days.       [Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):      On 7/2, we adjusted the Amine Swingbed valve stepper motor pulse duration within the ground software in an attempt to reliably trigger position sensor 2.  The sensor did trigger a couple of times but did not trigger for most of the operation period.    This showed that the sensor is operational (at least intermittently), but it leaves open the question of why the valve is not reliably driving all the way to it.  The team is currently working the fault tree analysis, and nominal ops are on hold until this issue is resolved. AMS-02 (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer):     No report. APEX (Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit) -Cambium:    No report. APEX-TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System):   No report. Asian Seed 2010 (JAXA):    Returned on ULF6. BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      This week we performed four tests.  In the first, we used a previously-burned flat acrylic sample.  Ignition was achieved, but there were only a few seconds of burning as the fuel did not get sufficiently heated to enable significant flame spread.  In the next three tests, we burned a 2-cm acrylic sphere in the wake configuration.  Different flow speeds were established, and nitrogen was used to try to extinguish the flame.  In one of the tests, Joe was able to get what we think was our lowest flow speed yet, as suggested by the nearly spherical shape of the resulting flame.  Nitrogen was generally effective in weakening and destabilizing the flames, but could not extinguish them except for the weakest flame at the lowest air flow setting, and even then it took several seconds for extinguishment.  Unfortunately, the initial igniter wire was installed but failed to work.  It was replaced with a new igniter wire which also broke after only a few seconds of use. We have 4 of 9 igniters remaining, but have some contingency plans including using SPICE igniters and modifying spent igniters from the used flat sample tests.  We continue to receive and are processing the high-resolution flame images. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   “Joe--we hope you enjoyed your "relaxing" time mixing all the BCAT-6 samples.  This run was important to get all the samples homogeneous (which sounds like you succeeded since you saw no structures in any of them during photography) so the sample module can sit un-disturbed now for at least 6 months.  It was critical to get these samples mixed, photographed and stowed so the PIs have this important data point (the pictures) and can compare them to what happens after 6 months when all the samples are photographed again.  Thank you for your tenacity and attention to detail during this arduous activity.  As soon as we see the images we will report back to you.”        [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

DECLIC-ALI (Device for the Study of Critical Liquids & Crystallization-ALICE-like, CNES/NASA):    The DECLIC ALICE-Like Insert SC7 Science Run is currently running via ground commanding.  The first 3 days of week 11 were dedicated to the observation of the boiling process when increasing the temperature.  The next 4 days (from 190 to 193), involved the determination of the relative critical temperatures Tc (instrument) for the transmission cell (better than ±  50 μ K) to confirm the results of the previous sequences.  During the observation phases, we took 15,000 images.  Scientists are satisfied with the obtained results. DomeGene (JAXA):    Complete.  DOSIS (Dose Distribution Inside ISS, ESA):     Nominal science acquisition with active and passive dosimeters inside Columbus continues. After the second monthly data downlink on 7/4, the DOSIS-3D science team confirmed good data.  Comparison of the dose rates for the DOSIS--3D and the DOSIS experiment shows a decrease in dose due to a change in ISS altitude - for DOSIS-3D the altitude was ~400 km, while for DOSIS it was ~50-60 km. EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students):     On 7/9, EarthKAM was set up in the Window Observational Research Facility (WORF) for the second time this year, utilizing a T61p Laptop and battery-powered D2Xs camera.  During this session, 5350 participating students from 99 groups from around the world requested images via the web-based system managed at the University of California, San Diego.  Camera control files containing student requests were uplinked to the laptop, resulting in extremely high-quality 12.3 megapixel images taken through the Lab window.  A 50mm camera lens was used for a wider field of view the first half of the run, and then swapped to a 180mm lens on 7/11 for higher resolution images the remainder of the run.  As of GMT 194, over 500 photos have been downlinked from this session, with many more expected for the remainder of the session.  Images processed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are posted to the EarthKAM website (https://earthkam.ucsd.edu/) for students around the world to study earth & space science, geography, social studies, math, and even art.  EarthKAM continues to inspire us all to take care of our home planet earth and share the excitement of space operations.  EDR (European Drawer Rack, ESA):    No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
