ISS On-Orbit Status 10/22/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – Crew off duty. FE-4 Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. The Russian flight engineer also completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] CDR Mike Fossum, FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa & Sergey Volkov joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the Potok Air Purification System pre-filters in SM & FGB.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. Furukawa & Fossum filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Mike & Satoshi also performed their 5th session each with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.       [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.] Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.        [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sergey also tended the current experiment with the Russian/German KPT-21 Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall/PK-3+) payload, running in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, by checking the hermeticity of the evacuated EB vacuum chamber after wakeup and before bedtime (any pressure increase above the vacuum should stay within 5 mmHg).        [Main objective of PK-3 is to study wave propagation and dispersion ratio in a dust plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber, at a specified power of HF discharge, pressure, and a varied number of particles.] At ~8:45am EDT, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~10:25am, Sergey Volkov had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). At ~11:25am, Volkov supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking congratulatory greetings to the Science and Research Institute of Long-Range Radio Communication (NIIDAR) at the Moscow Preobrazhensky Outpost on the occasion of their 95th anniversary, to be celebrated on 11/16 in Moscow.       [NIIDAR Science and Production Facility is one of the oldest Radio Industry facilities in Russia in the area of design and operation of extremely complex radio systems, design and manufacturing of scientific and engineering products, software products, and industrial engineering products.  Their key science and technology activities are: Designing high performance and high data rate facilities, radio electronic equipment, high information technology, telecommunication, and control systems.] At ~2:15pm, Sergey will conduct a second R-PAO downlink, addressing the participants of the Fifth World Science Forum in Budapest, organized by the Hungarian Academy of Science in partnership with UNESCO, European Commission, ICSU (International Council for Science), and AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science), to be held on 11/17-11/19.           [Topic of the Forum: “The Changing Landscape of Science:  Challenges and Opportunities”.  The forum will focus on world science achievements in the last two years, discussion of strategic areas of scientific development in global community of the 21st century, and associated political and economic issues.  Nearly two thousand participants representing 48 countries: scientists, politicians, members of international organizations, financial institutions, government agencies involved in science research, will be taking part in the forum.  Reports of the UNESCO General Director, Pál Schmitt, the President of Hungary, József Pálinkás, the President of the Hungarian Academy of Science, representatives of European Commission, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and World Bank, are included in the event agenda.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). Tasks listed for Sergei Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of bio-luminescent glow of high-production zones in the South-Eastern Pacific Ocean, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. Conjunction 1 Update:     The conjunction with Object #27700 (H-2A Rocket Body) at 6:31pm EDT tonight now has a collision probability of Zero, requiring no action.  Flight controllers continue to monitor subsequent tracking updates. Conjunction 2 Alert:     Flight controllers are tracking a second conjunction, with Object #30917 (Fengyun 1C debris).  TCA (Time of Closest Approach):  Sunday 10/23, 8:26am EDT.  This event is a Low concern and no action is expected at this time, although flight controllers will continue to assess updates.  A DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver), if required, would be scheduled at 6:08am tomorrow morning.

This entails sample 5 ops and the mix/photograph of samples 4-10 then stow.  To Mike Fossum, who asked about the lag time in feedback on the images:  “We are sorry that our response cannot be faster at times.  Here's what is going on.  The process to observe the images is somewhat arduous (photos go into the queue to have them retrieved from the on-board OCA, then they are sent to the JSC Digital Imaging Lab where they are then transferred to the proprietary ftp site (DIMS Exchange) during regular work hours; once the raw .nef file is saved to our computers, it takes a couple of minutes to open each one with the Fast Stone Image Viewer software.  Then they are put in a secure e-room folder for the PIs to retrieve and perform their image enhancement which is yet another time-consuming task.  At best, a day or two to receive, a day to open/view/post to e-room, and several days to image-enhance.  The last step is sometimes circumvented when feedback is provided to you (when possible from seeing the raw images) just by viewing the .nef images and relaying information on the focus, alignment and contrast of the samples.  The image enhancement is where the PI can offer in-depth scientific information about the evolution of the sample, as in the message that Dr. Peter Lu sent to you from Harvard about sample 4. Thank you for the exceptional quality of your work, which is much appreciated and of significant scientific value.” BIOLAB (ESA):    No report. BIORHYTHMS (JAXA, Biological Rhythms):     No report.

THERMOLAB (ESA):    “Mike, since you will be performing your next session of the THERMOLAB experiment next week, we thought we could provide you with some background description on the experiment (although this is your last session):  The human body regulates its core temperature to ensure that the temperature for the vital organs (brain, heart, liver and kidneys) is continuously at 37° C. Sweating or shivering are two of the mechanisms how the thermoregulatory system maintains the core temperature. In microgravity the thermoregulatory system is impaired.  For example, sweating is no longer an efficient method of cooling down the body temperature, due to the absence of convection - warm air no longer rises up.  THERMOLAB measures body skin temperature during strenuous exercises up to the maximum workout and oxygen uptake intensity, using two body temperature sensors positioned on the forehead and chest. The sensor on the forehead is positioned over the area where blood vessels that provide the blood supply to the brain surface through the skull, thus measuring the "brain temperature".  The chest sensor is positioned on the sternum, close to the heart.  Astronauts from previous missions reported that they got very hot during work outs or when working outside the space craft in their space suits. The THERMOLAB experiment investigates how the body heats up and afterwards cools down in microgravity and then compares these temperature curves with the ones measured on the same crewmember on the ground before and after the mission.” TRAC (Test of Reaction & Adaptation Capabilities):   Planned.

VESSEL IMAGING (ESA):      [It is known that the ability of blood vessels to vasoconstrict - the ability of the muscular vessel wall to narrow the diameter of the blood vessel - is impaired during and after a human has been in space.  "Vessel Imaging" is using the Ultrasound scanner on board the ISS to take images of the five different blood vessels in the lower abdomen and in the legs to study what changes occur to cause the blood vessels to be less able to vasoconstrict.  For each vessel, a 5 second scan is performed to observe the blood vessel during several heart beats, followed by a scan where the ultrasound scan-head is tilted to allow a "cut through the blood vessel wall".  The same scans are also performed before flight, and these pre-flight images are used as the baseline to which the in-flight data is compared with.  The images are analyzed to detect any changes in the blood vessel wall properties, such as wall thickness, elasticity or structure, changes in the size of the blood vessel or blood flow (volume) while the crewmember is in orbit.] VIABLE  (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS Payload Touch, NASA):    No report.

Like we said at the beginning of exercise, the error we saw during calibrations turned out to be a non-issue, but we couldn't tell for sure until the first rebreathing.  Hopefully that wasn't too confusing.  You're in the home stretch- only one session left!  Also, we gave Dan some additional training this week and were able to incorporate much of the info you have provided us about hardware issues, stowage, etc.  Thanks for the help with that!” VLE (Video Lessons ESA):    No report. WAICO #1/#2 (Waving and Coiling of Arabidopsis Roots at Different g-levels; ESA):    No report. YEAST B (ESA):    No report. CEO (Crew Earth Observation):      Through 10/17, the ground has received 20,174 CEO frames for review and cataloging.  “We are pleased to report your acquisition of imagery this week with times corresponding to those of our CEO Daily Target Lists for the following targets:  NW Glaciers of N. Patagonian Gl. Field - a few frames early in your session were of the eastern area of these glaciers - apparently the northwestern ones were socked in - we will keep trying;  US High Plains night imagery opportunity - a nice single frame looking southeastward from the Denver area was acquired and captioned by PAO for distribution; and Southeastern USA Night imagery pass - this successful run has been made into a video and posted on our public website - the actual session runs from Vancouver in the Pacific Northwest all the way to central Cuba - lots of nighttime geography!  Your recent view of the Parinacota Volcano and its companion summit Pomerape in the Chile-Bolivia border region of South America was posted this past weekend on NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website.  These snowcapped peaks contrast well against the arid, actively volcanic landscape of the Altiplano region.  Your view illustrates the complex volcanic and erosional processes in this remote, high-altitude environment.  You found these beauties while searching for Ubinas Volcano, one of our science sites.  Very nice shot!” CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Johannesburg, South Africa (Johannesburg [and surrounding gold-mining cities of the Witwatersrand] is the center of economic activity for a vast hinterland that extends as far north as Sudan.  As such, it is changing rapidly, partly due to in-migration from countries to the north, with the resulting increases in shantytown size and density.  Shooting overlapping near-nadir and nadir images), Pretoria, South Africa (imagery of this capital city, only 35 miles north of Johannesburg, ideally should be acquired with 180 mm lenses), and Pilcomayo River floodplain (Dynamic event.  Flooding is reported in this major South American river.  Looking just right of track [away from the Andes Mts] for a mapping pass using overlapping images.  The Pilcomayo River stops flowing, for unknown reasons, at this point near the Andes [slight tectonic subsidence is the probable explanation since its flow has remained steady for decades].  CEO staff requested oblique panoramas looking right to capture recent flooding at this critical point.  The end point of this river has retreated upstream 500 km since 1946.  Argentina and Paraguay are concerned that river may retreat all the way back upstream into Bolivia, thereby depriving these downstream countries of the water of this major river [which  acts as the international boundary between these countries].  Large engineering works are in progress to remove sand from the end point so that the river continues to flow into their territories).
