ISS On-Orbit Status 05/05/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty. Happy Cinco de Mayo! After breakfast, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-6 Pettit conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes using gray tape or vacuum cleaner. The three crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM.     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the Potok Air Purification System pre-filters in SM & FGB. The CDR also handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Don Pettit filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), his 14th.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~10:10am EDT, André Kuipers activated the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) routing to downlink the recording of his Treadmill Kinematics session of yesterday, stopping it at ~12:15pm. Later, André completed the (approx.) monthly O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, his 6th, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.        [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There has been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.] Pettit had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).  Today, Don also filled out the mid-Increment questionnaire which is part of the Journal.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] At ~8:30am, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Tasks listed for Kononenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).

BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):   This week, we performed three successful tests using the previously-burned, 1-cm diameter PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) sphere.  For the first test, ignition was achieved at 5 cm/s flow speed and the flow speed was held constant.  A blue flame appeared and transitioned to a sooty envelope flame.  The flow was turned off to extinguish the flame, and extinction dynamics were observed.  In the second test, the flame was again ignited at 5 cm/s flow and then the flow was reduced to around 2 cm/s resulting in a very large flame standoff distance.  The flame was extinguished by turning off the flow.  In the last test, the flame was ignited at the low flow speed of around 2 cm/s, and then the flow was turned down even further.   The flame maintained an almost spherical shape in the early stages.  After several seconds, the flow was turned up to maximum (around 25 cm/s), and the flame became long and quite sooty.  In about 20 seconds, the fuel was completely consumed and the flame went out.   BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   Matt Lynch, science PI for BCAT-6, samples 1 and 2, is saying that the latest round of sound clips and pictures from Don Pettit are "really interesting and really exciting".  Not all these pictures are yet available to us (perhaps half), so when the rest of them come down and are made available, Matt will match the sound descriptions with the associated images, which will enable him to provide more of a science analysis next week.  We are especially excited about the “50 micron” particles that Don Pettit spoke about in the sound clips and his discussion mentioning how he was able to capture pictures of them with the camera at select angles.  Status: Photos, sound clips, and video with comparison of BCAT-6, samples 1 and 2 just completed; Runs planned:  Samples 5, 6, 7, and 6-month photos; and Runs completed: BCAT-6, samples 1 and 2 just run.        [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     “Thanks, Don, for BLB LSM3 exchange, the HM Gripper re-installation and the cold spot sponge replacement on 4/30.” BIORHYTHMS (JAXA, Biological Rhythms):     No report.
