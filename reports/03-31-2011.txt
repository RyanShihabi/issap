ISS On-Orbit Status 03/31/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Upon wake-up, CDR Kondratyev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 (oxygen) generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] FE-5 Nespoli & FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 17th for them.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Early in the morning, Coleman also concluded her 4th NUTRITION w/Repository/Pro K 24-hr urine collection period (FD120), with samples deposited in MELFI.  Afterwards, Cady underwent the associated generic blood draw, with FE-5 Nespoli assisting with the phlebotomy as operator and shooting documentary photographs.  FE-6 then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI.    [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.] Later, Cady offloaded the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) storage tank from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary port to a CWC-I (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine) bag.  The PWD could not be used during the offloading.      [Estimated offload time: 23 min.] Paolo & Cady continued preparation of tools & equipment for the four ULF6 EVAs (Extravehicular Activities), each one spending about 2 hrs on this extensive task.        [These activities will continue over the next two weeks.  Tool configuration focuses on labeling & packing tool mesh bags with hardware for each EVA, including batteries & METOX cans, packing a few ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) bags and partially configuring the MWSs (Maintenance Work Stations).] Nespoli serviced the running BXF (Boiling eXperiment Facility) experiment in the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) by removing & stowing the tapes from both analog recorders & both digital recorders, labeling & installing new tapes, and resetting the tape counters.     [For the MABE (Microheater Array Boiling Experiment) part of the payload, Paolo verified that the Hi-8 recorders are in Short Play Mode.] With the MSG BXF (Boiling Experiment Facility) in the Lab currently handicapped due to the defective SAMS TSH (Space Acceleration Measurement System Triaxial Sensor Head), FE-6 Coleman retrieved an F02 SAMS sensor from the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), stored it temporarily, then fetched a cable from COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and installed a seat track device and the F02 sensor in the Lab at loc. S1.     [The European MSG used to be in COL but was transferred by Doug Wheelock and Scott Kelly to the Lab at S1.] Coleman also initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer) and deactivated the system ~5 hrs later.     [This was the 28th session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware], CDR Kondratyev performed the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA. Afterwards, Dmitri configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 3rd, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] Later, after charging batteries, Dmitri set up & started the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 for another run observing Earth’s surface & measuring Earth emission layer radiance in the atmosphere while simultaneously taking video from window #6.  Then, Dmitri tagged up with ground specialists for debriefing and dismantled the equipment.      [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from windows #9 & #6, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] With warmer times approaching in Kazakhstan, Dima relocated the three standard Russian TZK-14 Thermal Protection Jackets from the Soyuz TMA-21/25S spacecraft to stowage in the RS (Russian Segment).       [These warm coats, always ready for an emergency return in cold climate, are required to protect the crew after a landing Kazakhstan (or Russia) in winter time.]  As part of regular ACS (Atmospheric Control System) maintenance, Paolo Nespoli conducted the periodic 3-hr inspection of hatch seals in the USOS (US Segment), using a special vacuum cleaner and other tools.     [Inspected were the open hatches in COL, US Lab (Fwd, Aft), C/L (Crewlock), Node-1 (Fwd, Port, Aft, Stbd), and Node-3 (Stbd, Nadir).] Afterwards, Paolo equipped VTR1 (Video Tape Recorder 1) & VTR2 with fresh tapes, placing the removed old tapes in the “Return to Houston” bag in Node-2 (P4). In the US A/L (Airlock), Coleman terminated the discharge process on the first batch of two EHIP (EVA Helmet Interchangeable Portable) light batteries in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly) and initiated discharge on the second batch of 1 EHIP & 1 PGT (Pistol Grip Tool) batteries. For the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), FE-6 performed the periodic inspection of the exercise rope, looking for fraying or damage in the strands and to the recently added rope knot. CDR Kondratyev performed a continuity test of the “patient” cable of the MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”), part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity.        [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM, MBI-24 uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with body mass data and MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.] Later, Dmitri completed the periodic transfer of condensate water to an RS EDV container for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis into oxygen & hydrogen, filling the designated KOV (condensate water) EDV container from US CWCs.  When filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.       [The ~40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the Elektron’s BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles are detected in the EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O2 generator.] Kondratyev conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). The CDR also took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers], At ~8:20am EDT, the crewmembers conducted a “handover” teleconference with the Exp-27 crew Ron Garan, Alexander Samokutayev & Andrej Borisenko, due to launch at Baikonur on 4/4 next week. At ~10:00am, Nespoli conducted a tagup with the ESA staff at Col-CC at Oberpfaffenhofen/Germany.    [This conference is scheduled once every week, between ISS crewmembers and Col-CC via S/G2 (Space-to-Ground 2) audio.] At ~10:55am, Coleman conducted her regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists. At ~2:55pm, Kondratyev, Nespoli & Coleman had their standard bi-weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office (Steve Lindsey), via S-band S/G-2 audio & phone patch. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-5).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.] WHC Issue:   Troubleshooting is being planned for the current problem of filling the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) flush water tank which had several unsuccessful attempts by the crew.  Data indicate that there is a flow restriction or complete blockage of water flow between the WHC flush tank and WDS (Water Delivery System) accumulator.  Depending on usage rates, there is currently only enough flush water to get through next Tuesday.  Troubleshooting on Monday will attempt to fix this but should at least add water to the system buying more time.  If the system runs out of flush water, NASA would request use of the Russian ASU toilet facility. Conjunction Alert:   MCC-Houston is monitoring repeating conjunction threats with a piece of space debris.  Good data are expected later as to whether it will be a problem over the weekend.  Ballistics teams are assessing possible DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) impacts to upcoming rendezvous profiles.
