ISS On-Orbit Status 08/20/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.       Underway:  Week 8 of Increment 32 (six-person crew). Sleep cycle shift:  To accommodate the Russian EVA-31 spacewalk, the crew’s workday was extended by 4 hrs (i.e., sleeptime at 9:30pm instead of 5:30pm EDT).  Consequently, wakeup tomorrow morning also shifts by 4 hrs (from 2:00am to 6:00am), with regular sleeptime returning to 5:30pm tomorrow evening. Gennady Padalka & Yuri Malenchenko spent several hours getting ready for their spacewalk, EVA-31, configuring the DC1 and PkhO Transfer Compartment, checking out the Orlan-MK suits and their systems, the BSS spacesuit interface unit in the DC1, the BK-3M reserve oxygen bottle in the DC1, followed by suit donning, DC1 airlock depressurization and final leak checks of the suits and BSS interface unit. For the duration of the EVA, FE-2 Revin & FE-3 Acaba were isolated in the MRM2 Poisk module for about 8.5 hrs, from ~9:00am-5:30pm EDT, with access to Soyuz 30S, while FE-5 Williams & FE-6 Hoshide were locked up in the USOS (US Orbit Segment) with access to the FGB, MRM1 Rassvet module and Soyuz 31S.  EVA-31 began at 11:37am, about 45 min late, with hatch opening by Padalka (EV1) & Malenchenko (EV2).  It ended at 5:28pm, after a total EVA duration of 5 hours 51 minutes.[Spacewalk objectives were:Strela 2 (space crane) relocation from DC1 to FGB, using Strela 1,Installing Strela 2 on FGB EFGF (Electrical Flight Releasable Grapple Fixture)Stowing Strela 1 at DC1,Deploying the ball-shaped Sfera satellite,Installing 5 SMDPs (Service Module Debris Panels) on SM RO1 (small diameter segment) handrails,      Get-Ahead Tasks (time permitting) were:Removing SKK-2 material exposure “suitcase” on DC1,Removing Biorisk-MSN container 1 & stow in Ziploc bag,Installing support struts for EVA ladder on DC1.] All objectives were accomplished plus 2 of the get-aheads: Biorisk-MSN container removal & installation of EVA ladder struts.  The second container, SKK-2, could not be closed and was left outside for a later spacewalk. Earlier today, at wakeup, Gennady performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Before breakfast, CDR Padalka & FE-4 Malenchenko completed the standard pre-EVA session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis.  Involving visual urine assessment, MO-9 is one of 4 Russian crew health status checkups currently being conducted (the other three: MO-3 (Physical Fitness Evaluation), MO-7 (Calf Volume Measurement) & MO-8 (Body Mass Measurement).  A 2nd MO-9 session conducted tonight after conclusion of EVA-31.       [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).] Upon wakeup, FE-3 Joe Acaba, FE-5 Sunita Williams & FE-6 Akihiko Hoshide completed their currently daily post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 32nd for Joe, the 11th for Suni & Aki.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] FE-2 Revin conducted the periodic checkup of the circuit breakers & fuses in the DC1 Pirs Docking Compartment.      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 & MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 & BPP-36.  MRM2 & MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.] FE-6 Hoshide had Day 5 of his 2nd (FD30) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  In addition to closing out the associated 24-hr urine sample collections, Akihiko also underwent the generic blood draw, assisted by Sunita Williams, then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the JPM MELFI (JEM Pressurized Module Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Later, Aki stowed the equipment used for the urine and blood collections.     [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.  For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15th day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 & 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] Later, Akihiko configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 2nd (FD30) session of the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, assisted by Suni Williams in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres.  At ~12:10pm EDT, FE-6 observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.  Later in the day, Aki swapped Makita batteries and set them up for recharge.        [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] Before being isolated in MRM2, Sergei Revin –·        Prepared the module for his occupancy,·        Completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM;  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator],·        Disconnected the air duct between SM RO/Main Compartment and PrK/Transfer Tunnel (to ATV3) and the RO-PrK hatch protective ring, then closed the RO-PrK hatch [which necessitated some troubleshooting by him at ~10:30am because of a leak which disappeared after he re-closed the hatch],·        Worked with Gennady & Yuri on configuring ISS onboard systems for the EVA,·        Removed the air duct from DC1 (leaving the V3 fan in place), and·        Retreated into the MRM2 module, with MRM2-SU vestibule hatch closure, for his isolation during the spacewalk. After his isolation period ended, Sergei re-installed the air ducts in DC1, MRM2 and SM and then joined Gennady & Yuri for a late-night 15-min snack, followed by post-EVA MRM2 reconfiguration for nominal ops and deactivation of the Soyuz 31S, docked at MRM2. Before being isolated in MRM2 with Sergei, Joe Acaba –·        Retrieved 4 batteries from deployed SSCs (Station Support Computers) for use in a crew-choice SSC during MRM2 isolation, and moved them to the module,·        Gathered equipment & tools from stowage for work tasks to be completed during isolation, and transferred them to MRM2, and·        Collected items in preparation for a battery audit & consolidation activity while in isolation, and moved them to the Poisk module. Then, during his ~8.5 hr isolation in MRM2, Joe –·        Performed IFM (In-Flight Maintenance) by creating a “pantry” for QDs (quick disconnects), caps & plugs, i.e., a “one-stop-shop” such items, to e populated as caps and plugs are removed & stowed during other activities,·        Attempted (in vain) to repair two non-functioning video multipurpose arms for the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox),·        Conducted NanoRacks OCBT (Onboard Computer Based Training) by reviewing procedural materials for accessing NanoRacks platforms, reconfiguration of modules, and operation of the NanoRacks Microscope-1 and Microscope-2,·        Reviewed SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) robotics support procedures required for the upcoming EVA 18 (on 8/30) with the POC DOUG (Portable Computer System Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) application,·        Conducted a battery audit, sorting batteries according to type into two “pantry” bags, and·        Completed today’s entry in his digital Journal, late in the day. Before EVA begin, FE-5 Williams closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows. Other activities by Sunita during the day included –·        Conducting a safety check of the EVA Inhibit Pad, requiring inhibition of the CUCU (COTS UHF Communications Unit) equipment because of the US WVS (Wireless Video System) carried on Orlan-MK #5,·        Working in the US “Quest” Airlock to terminate auto-cycling on the EMU LLBs (Extravehicular Mobility Unit Long-Life Batteries) and then initiating their re-charge,·        Setting up the BCAT-C1 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test)-C1 sample from SFU for another session by changing camera & flash batteries, positioning the camera & flash for alignment and focusing on the sample to take images highlighting crystals, obtaining optimal image, and transferring proprietary images to SSC,·        Conducting a payload procedures review of upcoming InSPACE3 (Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Emulsions 3) activities,·        Transferring trash, waste and excessed equipment to HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3) Kounotori for packing and stowing,·        Completing today’s entry in her digital Journal, late in the day·        Resetting the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) of the ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera) using pre-saved settings before the recent reset,·        Retrieving the photographic equipment used during EVA from Yuri Malenchenko after his return onboard, and·        Downlinking the EVA imagery brought onboard to the ground, followed by temp stowage of the EVA cameras for the US spacewalk EVA-18. Before the EVA, FE-6 Hoshide assisted the Russian crewmembers with airlock operations in the DC1. The USOS crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3).      [FE-5 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Suni picks up where she left off, i.e., she would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Today, her SPRINT exercise continued with ARED/CEVIS, with T2 (aerobic, interval 30s), ARED/T2, and T2 (Kinematics, 2 min) following in the next 3 days.] After his workout on the T2 machine, Joe closed down the treadmill software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display.     [After the display shutdown, the T2 rack is power cycled (turned off/on) from the ground, and T2 is then ready for use.  These power cycles allow for the T2 data to be transferred to the Server for downlink.]  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
