ISS On-Orbit Status 05/12/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off duty. Upon wakeup, FE-5 André Kuipers & FE-6 Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, their 40th.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Kuipers continued his current extended session of the ESA ENERGY experiment.  FE-6 Pettit also contributed a urine sample later in the day as Control Subject.        [Activities included concluding the PFS (Pulmonary Function System) part of the experiment with disassembly of the PFM/PAM (Pulmonary Function Module/Photoacoustic Analyzer Module), GDS (Gas Delivery System), and MBS (Mixing Bag System), and stowage of the majority of the PFS hardware.  Collection of a water sample from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) in the Lab and urine sampling (on 2nd void of the day) are continuing, as is adherence to the special ENERGY breakfast plus logging all ISS food & drinks consumed during ENERGY experiment performance from lunch and dinner on Day 1 until breakfast on Day 10.  André wears an armband monitor, positioned on the right triceps where it started automatically on skin contact. The instrument must be worn for the entire 10-day ENERGY measurement period and removed only during showers or if needed during blood draws.  Activities without the armband monitor on the triceps must be carefully logged.   The monitor will be removed at the end of the 10-day period, then data will be downloaded from the device.   Background:  The observed loss of astronauts’ body mass during space flight is partly due to the systematic ongoing negative energy balance in micro-G, in addition to disuse. Unfortunately, the reason for such unbalanced match between intake and output is not clear, but appealing data suggest a relation between the degree of energy deficit and the exercise level prescribed as a countermeasure.  Purpose of the ENERGY experiment is (1) to measure changes in energy balance during long term space flight, (2) to measure adaptations in the components of the Total Energy Expenditure TEE (consumption), and (3) to derive an equation for the energy requirements of astronauts.  TEE is the sum of resting metabolic rate (RMR, measured), diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT, measured oxygen-uptake minus RMR) and activity-related energy expenditure (AEE, calculated).] After breakfast, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. The three crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM. The CDR also handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] André completed his weekly task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire.     [He started this activity after his Soyuz launch and is continuing it on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) once every week (after daily logging in the first week).  Neurologists from Leiden University are studying the question whether astronauts in space suffer from headaches.  With the help of a simple questionnaire, André registers the headache episodes and the eventual accompanying symptoms.  The results may help to characterize the frequency and characteristics of space headache and to develop countermeasure to prevent/minimize headache occurrence during the space flight], Don had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] At ~8:55am EDT, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~10:30am, Kuipers & Pettit conducted a “ crew handover” teleconference with the three Exp-31/Exp-32 crewmembers Padalka, Acaba & Revin at Baikonur, scheduled to launch on Soyuz 30S on 5/14 (~11:02pm EDT). At ~11:05am, Don Pettit activated the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) routing to downlink the recording of his CFE-2 VG-2 (Capillary Flow Experiments 2 / Vane Gap 2) science session of 5/10, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  Routing will be stopped by Don at ~3:25pm. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  Today’s exercise calls for CEVIS (aerobic), with ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic), T2, ARED+T2, CEVIS & ARED+T2 following in the next 5 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  GPS Failure:     On 5/10, GPS-1 (Global Positioning System 1) of SIGI (Space Integrated GPS/Inertial Navigation System) locked up and stopped producing attitude information, potentially due to an internal hardware issue.  Controllers on the ground power-cycled it twice (turned it off/on), but it did not come back on.  GPS-1 is drawing power but is not communicating with the GNC MDM (Guidance, Navigation & Control Multiplexer/Demultiplexer) computer.  There is another good spare onboard for an R&R (removal & replacement), as well as a degraded spare.  On 5/14 (Monday), the crew will access the SIGI GPS and perform the R&R to increase redundancy in preparation for SpaceX launch and berthing if the decision to do it is made by tomorrow.  Last April, when Burbank & Kuipers replaced the SIGI GPS in the Lab Aft Endcone, they ran into a couple of issues, and the R&R took eight hours of crew time split over two days using two crewmembers. Tasks listed for Kononenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).

BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      Thursday, 5/10, we burned 3 flat samples.  The first test was 2-cm-wide SIBAL fabric (50% cotton-fiberglass blend) which was burned at a constant flow speed of 20 cm/s.  Ignition and flame spread were nominal yielding a long yellow flame lasting approximately 30 seconds.  The second test was a 1-cm-wide SIBAL fabric which was burned at a constant flow speed of 10 cm/s.  The flame was very short and dim blue and burned for about 50 seconds.  Don was able to finish the tests quickly enough so that he was able to burn one additional sample, a Nomex-blend fabric.  We expected that ignition would be difficult to achieve, and indeed we were only able to observe a brief ignition flash and the flame could not be established.  Finally, Don performed a fan and nitrogen calibration.  The air flow and nitrogen flow are behaving nominally.  PMMA sphere tests are scheduled to be performed after the writing of this message, and will be reported on next week. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     “Thanks, André, for the BLB BGB gloves exchange on 5/4.” BIORHYTHMS (JAXA, Biological Rhythms):     No report.

ENERGY (ESA):       André, up to now everything is going extremely well.  The science and ground teams are delighted that you are coping so well with the science constraints and would like to cordially thank you for that.  It's not over yet, but well done and keep on going   The ground teams were glad to hear that you liked the special menu!  Don, we appreciate very much your participation as control subject.  The acquired data will be extremely valuable for the science team to be able to quantify the amount of Double Labeled Water that will be recycled in US system.     [Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
