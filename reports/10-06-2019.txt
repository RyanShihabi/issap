US P6 Battery Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #1:  Today, FE-3 and FE-9 performed a 7 hr 1 min space walk out to the P6 truss. This was the first of five planned ExtraVehicular Activities (EVAs) that will upgrade the existing the P6 2B power channel nickel hydrogen (NiH2) batteries with new Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries.  Integrated Electronics Assembly (IEA) Power Channel 2B NiH2 batteries 1-3 were released from the IEA; NiH2 batteries 1 & 2 were placed on External Pallet #8 (EP8) and NiH2 battery 3 was mounted to Adapter Plate A on the IEA. Two new Li-ion batteries were removed from EP8 and installed in the power channel 2B slot 1 & 3 locations.
