Nutrition Monitoring for the International Space Station (NutrISS): The crew performed the Bioimpedance Assembly Measurement (BIA) setup, took measurements, and filled out the questionnaire. Historical photos were also taken. Long duration spaceflight induces relevant changes in body composition and a loss of body mass. In the NutrISS investigation, a periodic assessment of body composition (body weight, fat mass and fat-free mass) during spaceflight aboard the ISS is carried out using a dedicated bio-impedance analysis device to allow for the measurement of long-term energy balance modification over time. Based on this data, it is hypothesized that an adjusted diet maintaining a near-neutral energy balance, and/or increasing protein, intake can limit microgravity-induced bone and muscle loss of crew members. 
Rodent Research-17 (RR-17): The crew perform day 1 of rodent operations. RR-17 uses younger and older mice as model organisms to evaluate the physiological, cellular and molecular effects of the spaceflight environment. Some responses to spaceflight in humans and model organisms such as mice resemble accelerated aging. This investigation provides a better understanding of aging-related immune, bone, and muscle disease processes, which may lead to new therapies for use in space and on Earth.
Waster & Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Urine Receptacle/Inlet Filter (UR/IF) and Piping Removal & Replacements (R&Rs): The crew successfully R&Rd the UR/IF and WHC piping. Following the R&Rs, the crew cleaned the WHC power supply, reactivated WHC, and performed a leak check to close out the activity.
Service Module (SM) Reboost: On Saturday the ISS performed a nominal reboost using the SM Main Engine thrusters. The purpose of the reboost was to set up the proper conditions for the 61S 4-orbit rendezvous on September 25 and the 58S landing on October 3.
