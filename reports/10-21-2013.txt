Cygnus Preparation for Unberth and Release: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Hopkins, FE-5 Parmitano and FE-6 Nyberg configured Cygnus and Node 2 vestibule today in preparation for unberth scheduled tomorrow, Tuesday October 22nd at 0545am CDT. The Cygnus hatch was closed earlier this morning followed by the removal of power, data, and air revitalization system (ARS) jumpers. Once jumpers were removed, the crew installed the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) Center Disk Cover and four CBM Controller Panel Assemblies (CPAs) onto an Active CBM bulkhead then closed the Node 2 nadir hatch.  Depressurization and leak check of the vestibule between the Node 2 nadir hatch and Cygnus was also performed nominally this afternoon. An additional leak check will occur tomorrow morning at 0340am CDT.
Biological Rhythms 48 Hour Experiment:  FE-6 Nyberg configured and donned an Actiwatch, attached electrodes, and will wear the Digital Walk Holter Electrocardiogram (ECG) for JAXA’s 48 hour Biological Rhythms experiment.  This study examines the circadian variation of astronaut’s cardiac autonomic function during space flight. The research is expected to provide insight into changes in crewmember’s autonomic functions before, during, and after long-duration space flight and may be used to improve health care technology for future ISS crewmembers.
Ku-Comm Unit (KCU)-2 Status: KCU-2 Single Board Computer (SBC) Card within the Modem failed to diagnostic mode on Saturday, resulting in a 40 minute loss of Ku-Band downlink. Ground teams successfully performed system tests and reset the card in order to recover from the anomaly. Teams are analyzing telemetry and are continuing their investigation into the root cause.
