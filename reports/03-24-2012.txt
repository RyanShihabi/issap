03-24-2012March 24, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 03/24/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – Crew off duty. Conjunction Update:    Early this morning, the six-member crew took precautionary shelter in their respective Soyuz vehicles, about 30 min before TCA (Time of Closest Approach) of a small piece of Russian Cosmos 2251 satellite debris which passed by the ISS at 2:38:33am EDT.     [At TCA, the debris was moving from left to right in front of the station at an estimated overall miss distance of between 11 & 14 km and a radial miss distance of 120 m.  The piece of debris was a remnant of a 2/10/2009 collision between the dormant Cosmos 2251 satellite and an operational Iridium 33 communications satellite. The collision added about 2,000 trackable items to the orbital debris catalog.   CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov & FE-2 Ivanishin sheltered in the Soyuz TMA-22/28S spacecraft attached to the DC1 Poisk module while FE-4 Kononenko, FE-5 Kuipers and FE-6 Pettit took to the Soyuz TMA-03M/29S on MRM1 Rassvet.  The debris initially was tracked Friday morning, but the late notification to the flight control team of a possible conjunction between the debris and the station precluded planning for a DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver).  This is the third time that a crew had to seek shelter in the Soyuz vehicles; the other times were 3/12/2009 and 6/28/2011.] After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Ivanishin performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~10:35am EDT, Kuipers turned on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and started the Ku-band data flow of video/data recorded during his preceding EPO (Education Payload Operation) MISSION X session for ESA to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about one hour, André turned MPC routing off again. FE-2 & FE-4 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~7:15am, Anatoly at ~10:35am EDT. At ~8:50am, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~9:20am, Burbank conducted a phone conference with the PLUTO (Plug-In Port Utilization Officer) flight control team at MCC-Houston. At ~8:15am, the six crewmembers joined for a Russian PAO TV comm session, downlinking messages of greetings to the participants of a solemn meeting and gala concert to be held at the Central Academic Theater of the Russian Army in Moscow and to the GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) employees for Cosmonautics Day on April 12.  The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).       [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2, with CEVIS, ARED+T2, T2, ARED+T2 & CEVIS, following in the next 5 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the volcanoes Cleveland, Mt. Etna, Karymsky, Sangay and Hudson;A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.
