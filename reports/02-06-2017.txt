H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)-6 Deorbit:  HTV-6 successfully completed all three deorbit burns over the weekend.  Loss of telemetry occurred Sunday 05-February at 15:11:21 GMT at an altitude of 80 km over the South Pacific near 50° S, 142° W. 
Lighting Effects Vision Test: This morning the crew unstowed the Visual Performance Test hardware, then configured the Solid State Lighting Assembly (SSLA) in their Crew Quarters (CQ) to the correct mode, turning off all other light sources, then performed one Numerical Verification Test and one Color Discrimination Test. The Lighting Effects investigation studies the impact of the change from fluorescent light bulbs to solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with adjustable intensity and color and aims to determine if the new lights can improve crew circadian rhythms, sleep, and cognitive performance.
JEM Airlock (JEMAL) Repress: The crew repressed and conducted a leak check of the JEMAL with the Exposed Facility Unit-5 (EFU5) adapter on the slide table.  Tomorrow the crew will install the HDTV EF-2. HDTV-EF2 is a high-definition television camera system delivered by HTV-6, which will be used for earth observation from the ISS.  
Dragon On-Board Training (OBT):  The crew participated in a conference with Ground Specialists in preparation of the start of robotics OBT for the upcoming Dragon rendezvous and capture.  Following this conference, they reviewed the OBT materials and then performed computer based proficiency training on the Dragon mission profile, the Dragon rendezvous crew procedures and the crew interfaces for monitoring and commanding.
