ISS On-Orbit Status 11/09/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup, FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also at wake-up, Volkov terminated his 6th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  CDR Fossum performed the (currently) daily check of the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera & flashlight battery charge and again 8 hrs later at midday and before sleeptime.  The Nikon D2Xs camera with EarthKAM software running with the Intervalometer on SSC-18 is taking automated flash photography.       [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking one photo each hour of Sample 2 (since 11/2).  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.] Volkov configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h5m session, his 6th, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] Sergey also completed his 2nd preliminary orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test run with the Russian Chibis suit in preparation for his return to gravity on 11/22 with Soyuz 27S (along with Mike Fossum & Satoshi Furukawa), conducting the ODNT exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill.  Satoshi acted as CMO (Crew Medical Officer for FE-4 as Subject.   Sergey was supported in his one-hour session by ground specialist tagup via VHF at 4:35am EST.        [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  The preparatory training consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -20, -25, -30, and -35 mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG ShKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap, supported by the Gamma-1M biomed data control system.   The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] With the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) seat in the Lab adjusted to permit access and the Lab camcorder set up to provide live viewing, Mike Fossum worked on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to replace its FOMA (Fuel/Oxidizer Management Assembly) Calibration Unit and the CIR IAM F/O (Fiver Optics) Cable #1 between the HiBMS (High Bit-Depth Multi-Spectral) Imaging Package at UML8 and the bottom FCF IPSU (Fluids & Combustion Facility / Image Processing & Storage Unit) at UML5.  Following the replacement of the FOMA Cal Unit in support of the CIR's yearly calibration and the replacement of the cable, plans are to return to the last bit of FLEX-2 (Flame Extinguishment Experiment 2) test points.      [This was to resolve the issue identified last month of the bottom FCF IPSU  at UML5 being unable to acquire images from the CIR HiBMS Imaging Package at UML8 (this pair of packages having been installed already in CIR in support of FLEX).  Today’s job concerned opening  both rack doors, pulling out and rotating the CIR Optics Bench down while disconnecting the MTL (Moderate Temperature Loop), VES (Vacuum Exhaust System) and Station N2 (nitrogen) lines.  Next, the FOMA Cal Unit was removed & replaced with a spare, followed by installing the new IAM F/O (Fiber Optic) Cable #1.  Lines were then reconnected, and activities were reversed for backing out and closing out.] With the G1 HD camcorder set up in the Kibo laboratory for downlinking his activity, FE-5 Furukawa conducted another “LEGO Bricks” EPO (Education Payload Activity) session in the JPM MWA (Maintenance Work Area), building a model of a Communication and Global Positioning Satellite from Lego pieces from a guide book for ground audiences.   Satoshi concluded his 4th (and final) 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~9:30am EST).  The laptop was then powered off.      [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] In preparation for Soyuz 27S undocking, CDR Fossum worked in the A/L (Airlock), gathering EVA hardware that was installed on EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) #3010 and temporarily stowed it in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) for pre-packing for return to Earth on 27S.      [These are 4 lower arm/glove suit protective covers, 2 EMU gloves, and a comm cap.]  In Node-3, Mike afterwards collected a 90cc water sample from the OGS (Oxygen Generation System) recirculation loop for 27S return.    [The OGS in the AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) rack was then re-activated by ground command, and the Sabatier reactor was powered on for OGS recirculation loop safing.] Later, Fossum completed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.     [The current card (29-0002E) lists 34 CWCs (639.9 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (7 CWCs with 292.7 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria;  2. Condensate water (10 CWCs with 35.7 L);  3. Iodinated water (12 CWCs with 216.9 L; also 3 expired bags with 59.1 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 15.3 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] FE-4 Volkov performed periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), initializing & deploying new Bubble dosimeters detectors, supported by ground specialist tagup.       [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (A21, A22, A27, A28, A33, A34, A35, A36) were initialized in the Bubble dosimeter reader in the SM and positioned at new exposure locations.  The deployment locations of the detectors were photo-documented with the NIKON D2X camera and also reported with initialization data to TsUP on log sheets via OCA.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.] Volkov also conducted the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness). FE-5 conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Later, Furukawa filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] FE-4 did the daily routine servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sergey also performed the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] Afterwards, Volkov continued preparations for Soyuz 27S undocking in two weeks (11/22), packing and loading return cargo with the help of an uplinked extensive of items list and stowage schematic for the Descent Module (SA). Using his own cargo list of about 30 items, Furukawa had 1h for prepacking US cargo items for return on 27S. Satoshi also closed the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] Mike Fossum again had an hour set aside for personal crew departure preparations which are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers. Before Presleep, Furukawa will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Satoshi will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~3:30am EST, Furukawa held his regular tagup with the Japanese Flight Control Team at SSIPC/Tsukuba via S-band/audio.      [This conference is scheduled once every week, between the ISS crewmembers and SSIPC.] At ~6:40am. Sergey Volkov support a Russian PAO TV event, engaging in another special “handover” teleconference with upcoming the upcoming Soyuz 28S crew of A.N. Shkaplerov, A.A. Ivanishin & D. Burbank, today with a TV camera to point out details.  These special handovers are intended to “lighten the load” of the abbreviated handover time resulting from the short overlap of Exp-29 & Exp-30 of only 5 days.     [Topics of “experience transfer” included the current status on Progress 45P transfers, recommendations for activities with radiograms, life support system (locations of equipment), science hardware (BIOEMULSION, PLAZMIDA, CASCADE, MEMBRANE, KONSTANTA, POLYGEN, MATRYOSHKA-R, MOLNIYA-GAMMA, SONOCARD), photo/video, and IMS data base.] At ~9:15am, Satoshi powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 9:20am conducted a ham radio session with young people at the Rehabilitationszentrum (Center for Convalescence) for Kinder and Jugendliche in Affoltern at Albis, Switzerland.   At ~1:25pm, the crew had their standard bi-weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office (Peggy Whitson), via S-band S/G-2 audio & phone patch. CDR & FE-5 had their standard weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Satoshi at ~9:00am, Mike at ~10:15am EST.The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5). Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Taking care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. RS Propellant Transfer:     After last night’s fuel (UDMH/Hydrazine) transfer from the 45P cargo ship to the SM BG2 tank (ended 6:11am), another transfer of oxidizer (N2O4 or NTO, nitrogen tetroxide) to SM tank BO2 will begin tonight at ~7:56 pm. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Amman, Jordan (WORLD CAPITALS COLLECTION SITE:  The Jordanian capital city of over 2 million is located in a hilly area of the northwestern part of the country about 25 miles northeast of the Dead Sea.  ISS had a mid-morning pass in clear weather with its approach from the SW.  As it tracked northeastward over the Sinai Peninsula at this time, the crew was to look for the Dead Sea and then try for nadir views of this target), Monaco, Monaco (WORLD CAPITALS COLLECTION SITE:  The tiny Principality of Monaco is a sovereign city-state of just over three-fourths of a square mile in area.  It is located on eastern part of the French Cote d’ Azure, between Nice and the Italian border.  This northeastward, nadir pass over this portion of the southeastern coast of France was in mid-morning light.  ISS had a brief break in the weather with clearing, but possibly partly cloudy weather expected.  Looking for the waterfront airport for Nice and carefully map along the coast to catch the coastal strip of Monaco to the E-NE), Subtropical Storm Sean (DYNAMIC EVENT:  Overnight the non-tropical low pressure system designated as Invest 98L by the National Hurricane Center organized sufficiently to be upgraded to Subtropical Storm Sean packing 50mph winds.  This storm is forecast to move very little and not strengthen significantly in the next 24 hours with perhaps a slow drift to the northwest.  Over time, it may develop tropical storm characteristics.  Sean is located between orbit tracks today.  Light will probably be too low in the earlier ISS pass to the SE of the system.  At this time on the pass to the NW in mid-morning the crew was over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico and able to look obliquely right of track.  Trying for short-lens context views of the cloud structure of this late-season storm), and Virginia Coast Reserve, Virginia (LONG TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEACH (LTER) SITE:  The pass was at mid-morning in fair weather with this target area just left of track.  This is a National Science Foundation-sponsored site with research focused on the mainland marches and lagoon systems behind the islands of the southern Delmarva Peninsula, particularly Hog and Parramore Islands.  Trying for context views of this target area today).
