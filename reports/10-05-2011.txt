ISS On-Orbit Status 10/05/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.        FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. At or after ~2:25am EDT, FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa concluded his 2nd NUTRITION w/Repository 24-hr urine collection period, with samples deposited in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Additionally, Satoshi underwent the associated generic blood draw, with Mike Fossum assisting with the phlebotomy as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  FE-5 then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI.     [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.] Afterwards, Furukawa used the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) equipment in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), for the monthly measurement of his body mass.   In addition to the mass determination session, Satoshi performed a SLAMMD control run, using a (known) calibration mass from stowage.         [In order to make room at COL bay F3 for the SLAMMD calibration arm, CDR Fossum beforehand worked on relocating the MARES VIF (Muscle Atrophy Research & Exercise System / Vibration Isolation Frame) for the time being.] The CDR serviced the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) experiment, checking camera operations during the day and changing the camera battery in the morning and before sleeptime (change required after 8 hrs).        [The new experiment session is with a Harvard University phase separation sample using a different setup than for the recent crystal samples 9 & 10, mainly requiring an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM timing software, power cables and camera USB cable.  For illumination, the Mini-MagLite and Flash batteries do not need to be changed yet, but the camera will need a freshly charged battery.  After Mike started the run on 9/21 by mixing the sample (#4) for phase separation and taking test photos, the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) software on the SSC-13 laptop began taking pictures of Sample 4 for 13 days at different intervals throughout the run.  This requires camera battery changes twice a day and image check with a battery change once per day.  BCAT-5 is operating in the JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) because some time ago the crew deemed the US Lab too crowded for running it.] FE-4 Volkov completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] In the SM, Sergei supported the overnight test of the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) by copying the test data collected overnight from the RSE-SLS A31p laptop to the RSS2 laptop for data downlink and log file dump, supported by ground specialist tagup. Afterwards, Sergei had 2.5 hrs set aside for replacing the FGS gas-liquid mixture filter/separator, trap insert and 4 hoses (K-G3, K-T, V1-L1, V1-L1) of the Russian water recovery system’s SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor. In the Node-3 Cupola, Satoshi Furukawa set up the JAXA SSHDTV (Super Sensitive High-Definition Television) camera for another session, equipping it today with the IR (Infrared) cut filter 3 on a single-focus 17 mm lens and the automatic recorder clock & time code set for 5 min of recording of Aurora recording. The CDR uninstalled the three alignment guides from CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) at Lab bay S3 to allow the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be activated before begin of ground-commanded CIR operations requiring a microgravity environment. Afterwards, Fossum performed regular maintenance calibration on the sensors of the two CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1046 & #1059. With the STTS communication systems configured temporarily for crew presence in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, Volkov set up and conducted an operational run of the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), supported by ground specialist tagup.  STTS was then reconfigured to nominal.  Sergei later set up the two SONY HVR-Z1J video camcorders for replaying and downlinking their recorded footage via VHF over RGS (Russian Groundsites) at 12:14pm-12:31pm EDT and 1:43pm-2:07pm, followed by disassembly of the equipment.          [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS: condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.] FE-4 also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] After the CDR broke out and set up the HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) Ultrasound equipment, FE-5 Furukawa underwent his first scan as subject, with Fossum assisting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Later, Satoshi in turn performed the USND scans on Mike as subject.      [Objective of the Ultrasound scans was an eye examination for both subjects.] Later, Fossum used the Velocicalc instrument for air flow velocity measurements between the US Lab, Node-1, Cupola and Node-3 to determine if the THC IMV (Temperature & Humidity Control / Intravehicular Ventilation) needs cleaning.  Furukawa provided assistance.        [The Velocicalc in its Thermal Anemometer setting is equipped with Thermal/Pitot tube sensors for taking air flow readings.  The sensors are so sensitive that breathing too close by could skew the data.] Sergei completed his 3rd data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.        [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] FE-5 performed the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, including cleaning the muffler air inlet screens on the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & Lab O1, resp. CDR Fossum had about 90 min reserved for installing an IMV return jumper between Node-1 (loc. D1) and the attached PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) Leonardo, intended to facilitate IMV flow when hatches are closed.  Furukawa assisted with the actual installation of the air duct.      [Steps included removing the Node-1 Deck Fwd Outboard IMV cap, equalizing & removing the Node-1 Inboard IMV cap, reinstalling Node-1 closeout panels, installing the IMV jumper/duct, and closing out the worksite.] Sergei Volkov set up & readied the equipment for a session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), to be conducted tomorrow right after wake-up.       [MO-10 measures the red cell count of the blood.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.] Before “Presleep” period tonight, Furukawa turns on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Satoshi will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~4:45am EDT, FE-5 Furukawa conducted the regular tagup with the Japanese Flight Control Team at SSIPC/Tsukuba via S-band/audio.      [This conference is scheduled once every week, between the ISS crewmembers and SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center).] CDR & FE-5 had their standard weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Furukawa at ~12:45pm, Fossum at ~2:50pm EDT. Tasks listed for Sergei Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Relocating Russian items from unauthorized stowage locations, based on an uplinked listing,Completing the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), and ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5). JAXA Marangoni Experiment:    The crew was advised of another Marangoni bridge building event tonight (7:00pm-1:00am), the 10th in 24 planned bridge buildings in Increment 29/30.  The experiment is performed in the Kibo JPM during crew sleep (since the liquid bridge to be formed is sensitive to g-jitter), 4 days/week at most and 24 runs in total.  After the liquid bridge has been formed, the ground imposes a temperature gradient on it to produce Marangoni convection.   The crew, which will be informed regularly, has been asked to avoid any disturbances in this timeframe.  Even disturbances in other modules can be transmitted and cause the liquid bridge in JPM to break up, resulting in science loss. Conjunction Alert:    Flight controllers continue to monitor the conjunction with Object #30002, debris from the Chinese satellite Fengyun 1C, currently classified as of low concern due to several tracking updates.  TCA will be tomorrow (10/6) at 10:04am EDT.  A DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver), which would have to be conducted at ~7:46am, is considered not necessary at this time. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) target uplinked for today was Harare, Zimbabwe (looking right for this capital city of 1.8 million [greater Harare - 2.8 million].  Cincinnati is its US “twin city.”   (Note: Due to cloudy conditions and crew awake timing there is only one feasible target for today.)
