Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) Hardware Replacement: FE-3 Hopkins used the Maintenance Work Area (MWA) for restraining the Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus (MDCA) Chamber Insert Assembly (CIA) while he installed fuel reservoirs, replaced two igniter tips and exchanged manifold bottles  to prepare for future operations.
ISS InterModule Ventilation (IMV) Airflow Measurement: In support of monitoring the health of the ISS InterModule Ventilation (IMV) system, FE-5 Mastracchio and FE-6 Wakata used the Velocicalc device and a set of measurement aids to measure the air flow outlets and inlets throughout the USOS modules. In addition to flow rate measurements, inspections were performed in selected locations including the Airlock IMV Panel Screen on the IMV air return port and Node 3 inlet vents.
USOS Airlock Restow and Deconfiguration Post US EVA 25: Mastracchio deconfigured the Airlock post US EVAs 24 and 25 and prepared the EMUs for long-term stowage.  EVA hardware that was moved out of the Airlock during the EVAs was moved back into the Airlock and reorganized items for future return or trash. Some items were left in the PMM in preparation for future vehicle staging.
