ISS On-Orbit Status 03/14/12 >>>Today 17 years ago (1995), Astronaut Norman Thagard, a medical doctor, became the first American to ride into space aboard a Russian rocket, in the Soyuz TM-21 spacecraft, to spend 115 days on the space station Mir as part of Expedition Mir-18.  Before that, Norm had flown on four Space Shuttle missions.<<< All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After breakfast, FE-2 Anatoly Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Ivanishin also conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  Anatoly will terminate the process at ~5:15pm EDT.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday.  (Done last: 2/23 & 2/24).       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hrs and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.] Shkaplerov ran a test session with the Russian biomed assessment MO-14 (Assessment of Orthostatic Endurance w/o LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) which examines the orthostatic stability of the crewmember’s cardiovascular system at rest using complex methods.       [The session was conducted at rest without the Chibis-M ODNT/LBNP and Holter BP (blood pressure) devices, using only the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex, to test its telemetry downlink at an RGS (Russian Groundsite) overflight at ~4:54am.] FE-4 Kononenko & FE-1 Shkaplerov spent several hours conducting the scheduled leak check of the newly installed (on 3/12) KVD Pressure Equalization Valve #109 in the hatch between the FGB’s PGO Instrumentation & Cargo Compartment (priborno gruzovoj otsek) and the SM PkhO (Transfer Compartment).  During the time of closed hatch, safety required the crewmembers to remain on the side where they could reach their particular Soyuz spacecraft in a contingency.  This had Dan Burbank (a crewmember of Soyuz TMA-22/28S) temporarily isolated in the SM.     [Soyuz 28S is docked at MRM2 which is connected to the SM PkhO.] Working in PMA-1 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 1) and PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), FE-5 Kuipers unstowed and readied CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) containing crew clothing for Dan Burbank to perform audits & consolidations of ISS-30 crew underwear during his isolation in SM.  After isolation ended, André continued the clothing consolidation of CTBs with crew athletic shorts, while FE-6 Pettit restowed the consolidated CTBs in PMA-1 and PMM endcone.     [The consolidation, which also helped clean out PMM, was guided by uplinked IMS (Inventory management System) listings.] Anatoly Ivanishin continued the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the FGB cleaning the TsV1 fan screen.  Later, FE-2 moved to the SM for cleaning the numerous Group A ventilator fans & grilles. Don Pettit used a Lenovo T61p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop to update the firmware and coefficients of the spectrophotometer of the CWQMK (Colorimetric Water Quality Monitor Kit), getting it ready for the upcoming next round of water sampling. Afterwards, Pettit configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 3rd (FD75) session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, assisted by André Kuipers in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres.  At ~8:05am EDT, FE-6 observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.        [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] Kuipers later concluded his own 3rd (FD75) ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~11:45am ED), then powered on the laptop and downloaded the data from the two Actiwatch Spectrums, copied the data from the 2 HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC and downloaded Cardiopres data.         [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] Don had ~40 min allotted to search for a missing WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) E-K pre-treat tank, going through the JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment). Pettit also continued the preventive inspection & cleaning of accessible AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) system bacteria filters in Node-1, Node-2, Node-3, Airlock and Lab, started earlier (3/8) by Kuipers. For CDR Burbank, it was the second of two days of Robonaut operations, covered by cabin video from Node-2 for ground monitoring, including H&S (health & systems) telemetry in real-time.  After reviewing instructional procedures and video, Don powered on Robonaut in conjunction with ground commanding.  The ground then took over to put Robonaut in its Ready Pose and run Velocicalc scripts, having the robotic crewmember measure air velocity at the Lab Fwd Stbd IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) outlet diffuser with the Velocicalc instrument.  Afterwards, Dan and André powered down and disassembled the equipment for re-stowage. Kuipers completed the periodic tape exchange on the two VTRs (Video Tape Recorders), removing old tapes from VTR1 & VTR2 for stowage in a trash bag in Node-3 and replacing them with new tapes from Node-2 stowage. Next, André relocated the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) from its Lab location at S1 to Node-2 for MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) activation. Later, FE-5 removed the desiccant packages in the MELFI-3 Dewars.  In the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Pettit installed cables and accessories between the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) and the VSCU (Video Signal Converter Unit) in the MSPR (Multi-Purpose Small Payload Rack).  VSCU will be used for downlinking video imagery from CBEF operations. Afterwards, André floated into the US A/L (Airlock) to torque the fasteners of the SDS (Sample Delivery System) sample probe which had become loose during ULF-6 and was up to now secured hand-tight. FE-1 Shkaplerov used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 and the overnight freshly charged FSS photo spectrograph battery, taking pictures of targets along the flight track during a one-hour segment, covering water & coastal area of Lake Manitoba, Winnipeg, Hudson Bay, Gulf of  Saint Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean.       [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] After switching STTS RS comm system to support MRM1 Rassvet occupancy, Anton Shkaplerov worked ~3 hrs in the module, outfitting it with a new framework designed to carry a yet-to-be-installed glove box sliding shelf.      [Hardware used: 2 arc-shaped pieces (to fit the shell curvature), 2 short longeron beams, two brackets (left & right), and fasteners.]  Anatoly & Oleg again had time set aside (FE-2: 1.5h; FE-4: 1h) for recording high-resolution video with the SONY HVR-Z7E  to be used in a joint project of Roskosmos TV Studio with Karusel (Carousel) TV Channel for children ages 8 to 12 years, the “It’s Time to go to space!” program, which has a segment where Russian cosmonauts are discussing their work &, answer viewers’ questions (currently they are working on a New Year episode).  The footage was then to be downlinked to TsUP-Moscow, Kononenko performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anatoly care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur) Burbank & Pettit again had a time slot reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.        [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] CDR & FE-6 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Don at ~1:30pm, Dan at ~1:55pm EDT. At ~2:00pm, Pettit powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 2:10pm conducted ham radio session with students at Liberty Junior High School, Burbank, IL. At ~2:30pm, the crew conducted their standard bi-weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office/CB (Peggy Whitson), via S-band S/G-2 audio & phone patch. Pettit performed a session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video was then downlinked via MPC.     [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2, with CEVIS, T2 (Treadmill Kinematics) following in the next 2 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Before sleeptime, Oleg will set up the battery of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment for overnight charging.      [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �CA ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Allalin Glacier, Kolka Glacier, the glaciers of the Pamirs: RGS, Bear & Mabuza, Lipetsk, volcanoes Levotobi, Stromboli, Mount Etna, Hierro, Krakatoa, Papandayan & Kilimanjaro, the Volga River Delta, the Caspian & Aral Sea, the Kerch Strait, Laganakskoe plateau, Krasnaya Polyana,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). MT Translation:    This morning during the 2-hr period of 10:30am-12:30pm EDT, the Mobile Transporter with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) was moved from WS2 (Worksite 2) to WS4 by Robotics ground control.  SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) and SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) remained inactive.  For the translation, Russian thrusters were temporarily disabled from 10:30am-12:30pm for load relief. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Calcutta, India (Capital Cities Collection: ISS had a mid-morning pass over the capital city of the Indian state of West Bengal in fair weather.  Looking just left of track to capture shots of Calcutta, which lies on the east bank of the Hooghly River, a smaller distributary in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta.  The Hooghly is the crew’s main visual cue since the city blends into the countryside.  Trying to capture the entire city in the shots), Bern, Switzerland (Capital Cities Collection: The Swiss federal capital lies in the rolling plateau region north of the Alps and northeast of Lake Geneva.  ISS had an early afternoon pass approaching from the NW in clear weather.  Looking left of track for this small city of about 125,000 in the valley of the Aare River), San Marino, San Marino (Capital Cities Collection: ISS had a nadir pass over this tiny capital city of this microstate.  Trying for a mapping strip to acquire useful views.  The Republic itself is land-locked and is located about 20 miles SW of the Italian coastal city of Rimini.  The crew’s best visual cues are Rimini's small but prominent bay and a light-toned river which reaches the sea at this point), and Cairo, Egypt (Capital Cities Collection: The Egyptian capital is a sprawling mega-city of over 12 million and located at the apex of the agricultural region of the Nile River delta.  ISS had an afternoon pass in fair weather with approach from the NW.  At this time as it reached the coast, the crew was to begin looking just right of track for this target and try for single frame views).
