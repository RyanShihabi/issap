ISS On-Orbit Status 02/18/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – Crew rest day. After wakeup this morning, CDR Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 29th for Dan, the 23rd for André & Don.     [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-6 Pettit serviced the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.  Sample 4 session reached its midpoint on 2/15.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 4 once every two hours for seven days.  Crew performs two camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike Fossum’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.] After yesterday’s Part 2 of MARES (Muscle Atrophy Resistive Exercise System) Commissioning, FE-5 Kuipers today relocated items removed in preparation of MARES deployment back to their original locations on the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) deck rack front.       [This included all bags, the MARES (Dynamometer, MARES EPM HD (European Physiology Module High Definition), WS2 Ethernet cable, Ziploc bag with 3 connector caps and the mainbox.] Later, André performed his 2nd session with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.       [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.] CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov, FE-2 Ivanishin, FE-4 Kononenko, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM. Dan Burbank conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Shkaplerov completed the standard purging & inerting of the SrPK (air supply tankage) Section 2 of Progress 46P (M-14M) by charging it with N2 (nitrogen).    [46P is scheduled for undocking on 4/19.]  Afterwards, Anton & Oleg had ~1 h for inspecting and stowing the Orlan-MK spacesuit equipment used in the EVA-30 on 2/16.      [This included the BK-3 oxygen bottles,.LP-9 absorber cartridges, the USZ (ORU) kit with VO separator, FOR-4, BOS-1 & IK filters and UdP drink containers, BK-10 underwear, MAGs, socks, 5PT containers, the ZIP-2M kit with the GP-10KM gloves, and the Orlan-MK suits.] Anatoly meanwhile performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Kononenko terminated the discharge process on the first Orlan 825M3 battery pack and started it on the second pack. At ~7:45am EST, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~9:25am, Burbank & Pettit conducted a phone conference with the PLUTO flight control team, discussing automated SSC (Station Support Computer) client reboots with the OpsLAN specialists. FE-4 & FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~7:00am, Don at ~11:55am EST. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6, and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). WRM Update:     A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (29-0008K) lists 23 CWCs (363.9 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (4 CWCs with 143.3 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria, plus 1 empty bag;  2. Condensate water (2 CWCs with 9.8 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (6 CWCs with 79.9 L; also 6 expired bags with 104.3 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 6.4 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Conjunction Update:   Flight controllers continue to monitor a conjunction with Object 29423 (Chinese CZ-4B DEB) with a TCA (Time of Closest Approach) on 2/19 at 4:02pm EST.  The conjunction is currently considered of Low Concern.  The decision point (Go/NoGo for maneuver data Cyclogram development) is tonight (2/18) at 4:32pm, for a DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) tomorrow (2/19) at 4:02pm EST, if required.

BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):     Sample 1 (Lynch and Kodger, P&G) – “Don when you used a laser pointer to coax information about the domain size from sample 1, this was a profound discovery, for this sample appears different in microgravity.  Ways of comparing the domain size of samples 1 and 2 (discussed in email exchanges between you and Matt Lynch) should help the scientists at P&G decide important product formulation questions that are not possible to examine in 1-g on earth.  Sample 4 (Weitz and Lu, Harvard) – Peter Lu has studied the pictures obtained so far and has concluded that this sample has yet to phase separate into colloid rich / colloid poor (model liquid / gas) phases.  While it will take more time to know for sure, if this condition persists, this will mean that we have reached or passed the critical point in the phase diagram.  If the particles and fluid in this sample were not so well index matched, the sample would look opalescent beyond the critical point; in this case, it may look wispy or cloudy, but in a very low-contrast kind of way.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.
