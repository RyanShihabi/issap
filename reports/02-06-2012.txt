ISS On-Orbit Status 02/06/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway:  Week 11 of Increment 30 (six-person crew). After wakeup this morning, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also at wakeup, FE-1 completed the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. CDR Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 27th for Dan, the 20th for André and Don.         [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Continuing their support of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment, Burbank & Kuipers logged their daily diet of the current Session 2 (Low Salt Diet) on their electronic log. FE-4 Kononenko conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~4:15pm EST.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 1/18 & 1/19).] Shkaplerov, Ivanishin & Kononenko completed the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg were joined by Dan, André & Don in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device set up (and later cleaned up and stowed away) by Shkaplerov.       [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ] Preparatory to upcoming ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) operations, Anton Shkaplerov retrieved the ATV PU control panel from its stowage location and installed it at its nominal location in the SM for ATV Rendezvous, Docking & Undocking, followed by documentary photography for subsequent downlink via OCA.   Afterwards, with STTS communications configured by FE-4, Kononenko & Kuipers successfully completed a pre-docking test for the ATV by checking command transfers from the ATV control panel and associated laptop to the Progress-mounted Klest KL-154 television camera and the functionality of the Simvol-Ts (“symbol center”) color monitor which also displays an overlay of rendezvous data from the onboard digital computer.  Afterwards, STTS was reconfigured to nominal settings.   Working about 3.5 hrs in Node-3 on the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System 2) rack, CDR Burbank removed components of the ARFTA (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) modification kit in order to reconvert the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) to nominal RFTA operations.       [Steps included unstowing the equipment, removing the ARFTA and associated filters from the WRS-2 rack, de-routing the mod kit hoses and then installing an RFTA and depress hose for UPA processing.] After activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) and setting up the G1 camcorder in the Lab, FE-6 Pettit configured the SLICE (Structure & Liftoff In Combustion Experiment) hardware and performed troubleshooting on the SPICE (Smoke Point In Coflow Experiment) Power/Video Unit.  MSG was then put on standby and its laptop powered off.  Testing will start next week.      [Don performed an internal inspection and removed the conformal coating from the Power/Video Unit in order to make jumper connections to switch/reset video titler settings.  The reset switched the video overlay from the hexadecimal trouble-shooting mode in which it was stuck to the normal display of data (e.g., flow conditions).  SPICE’s primary data are still photos of flames, but the corresponding flow conditions come from the video overlay and are not otherwise available (in normal ops).  Without these data, flame photos by themselves are not helpful for science.  The reset was accomplished by a sequence of jumper connections on the video unit.  Afterwards, Don cleaned the SPICE experiment assembly to remove the accumulated soot from the 2009 ops, followed by a fan calibration to verify that the air flow is recovered and to determine the new relationship between the fan data and the velocity profile within the assembly.  Objectives of SLICE are to characterize the structure of a flame from attached through lifted conditions, identify the liftoff velocity limits, i.e., where the flame separates from the burner tube and, in the final quarter of testing, conduct the SPICE which was last conducted in 2009.  Earth application: Increased efficiency and reduced pollutant emission for practical combustion devices, improved numerical modeling, hence improved design tools, hence improved practical combustion on Earth (currently, the good modeling-experiment agreement breaks down when flames are lean or heavily sooting).  Measurements: still images (with camera that was blackbody calibrated for pyrometry), video & radiometer.  Hardware:  SLICE is conducted in the MSG using the SPICE hardware.] FE-5 Kuipers conducted the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.       [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Also in Node-3, André serviced the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) by replacing its PT (Pretreat Tank) with a new spare. In preparation for the Orlan EVA-30 on 2/16, Shkaplerov performed an activation test of the KVD (PEV/Pressure Equalization Valve) of the DC1 airlock from the EVA support panel (POV) in the SM PkhO Transfer Compartment, followed later by a second activation test from the POV in the DC1 Docking Compartment. Afterwards, Anton & Oleg jointly reviewed EVA-30 procedures and then observed Oleg’s (EV1) translation paths and work zones outside the station through ISS windows, supported by ground specialist tagup. Also in preparation for their Orlan-MK dry-run on 2/14 and the spacewalk on 2/16, Oleg & Anton performed a 1-hr session each with the standard Russian MedOps procedure MO-6 (Hand-Cycle Ergometry) in the SM, assisting each other in turn and being supported by ground specialist tagup on two comm passes (Oleg: 11:45am & Anton: 1:20pm EST).      [Because cosmonauts in early Russian programs have shown noticeable decrease in arm muscle tone, TsUP/IBMP (MCC-Moscow/Institute of Biomedical Problems) physical fitness experts have groundruled the handgrip/arm tolerance test analysis (hand ergometry) as a standard pre-Orlan EVA requirement.  For MO-6, the subject dons the ECG (electrocardiogram) biomed harness, attaches three skin electrodes and plugs the harness into the PKO medical exam panel on the cycle ergometer.  The other crewmember assists.  The exercise itself starts after 10 seconds of complete rest, by manually rotating the cycle's pedals, set at 150 W, backwards until "complete exhaustion".] In the SM Stbd Kabin (CQ-2/Crew Quarters 2), FE-2 Anatoly Ivanishin performed maintenance on the RBO-3-4 Matryoshka-R radiation protection cover (RL) by installing four ID-ZMKS dosimeter assemblies and replacing packages of SLG wet wipes. Afterwards, Anatoly serviced the SM Rodnik water tank BV1 by draining the disinfectant solution from it into an EDV container and then starting the pumping equipment with the electric compressor for the standard BV1 bladder compression & leak check.      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.] On TsUP Go, FE-2 was to refresh ISS cabin atmosphere with another O2 repress from Progress M-14/46P (#414) SRPK tankage. Later, Ivanishin conducted another 30-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Eastern Pacific, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. Anatoly also spent ~2 hrs in the MRM1 Rassvet module, replacing three IDZ-2 electro-inductive smoke detectors with newer IDZ-3 units, trashing the old detectors. André Kuipers started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.        [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] Next, FE-5 printed out and deployed 6 updated procedures sheets for Respirator & Cartridge Changeouts.  A copy was deposited in each crewmember’s Ammonia Respirator Kit, preferably 3 in English and 3 in Russian.  Afterwards, André broke out and set up the PPFS MBS (Portable Pulmonary Function System / Mixing Bag System) in ESA’s COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for his first VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) with Thermolab session, scheduled tomorrow, configuring the necessary PPFS power, data, front panel, and gas connections. Oleg set up the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h5m session, his 2nd, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] Burbank undertook the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics.  At the end, Dan completed a self-assessment questionnaire.  Answers were then provided at test conclusion.        [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] Anatoly performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anton took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). André supported subsequent overnight ground commanding of video downlink of JAXA Marangoni experiment activities by activating the MSPR (Multi-Purpose Small Payload Rack)’s VRU (Video Compression & Recording Unit), MSPR Hub and the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) in MSPR. Dan & Don had another time slot reserved for making entries in their electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Before Presleep, Pettit will turn on the MPC and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don will turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4). Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on Volcano Huascaran, Volcano Cordon-Kaul, and Patagonian glaciers,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). No CEO targets uplinked for today. Conjunction Update:    Flight Controllers continue to track a conjunction with Object 27098 (PSLV debris) with two TCAs (Times of Closest Approach) at Tuesday, 2/7, at 10:50am & 12:22pm EST.  The debris has moved into the Green zone and is currently no longer of concern.    [PSLV = Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, an Indian four-stage launcher.  This object is a piece from the fragmentation of the fourth stage of the 2001 launch of this launcher type.  The breakup occurred approximately two months after its successful launch and payload deployment.]
