ISS On-Orbit Status 02/17/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sleep shift in effect:  The ISS crew’s workday began last evening at 4:14pm and ended this morning at 7:44 EST (see time table at bottom).  Mission 20A’s EVA-3 was completed successfully by EV1 Bob Behnken & EV2 Nicholas Patrick in 5h 48m, accomplishing all objectives plus two get-aheads.  Beginning last night at 9:15pm EST, the spacewalk ended at 3:03am.    [EV1 & EV2 began their “campout” yesterday evening in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe.  Last night, following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe (4:54pm-6:04pm) for Behnken & Patrick after spending the “night” on 10.2 psi, the A/L hatch was closed again by TJ Creamer for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge and prebreathe in the EMUs.]  During EVA-3, Behnken & Patrick –     Connected PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3) heater and data cables,Opened Node-3 ammonia loop B QDs (Quick Disconnects), to integrate the second channel of the Node-3 cooling system into ISS ETCS (External Thermal Control System), Disconnected the temporary Node-3 heater cable,Removed Cupola thermal covers and released launch locks,Installed several handrails and worksite interface fixtures on Node-3 to assist with future EVAs,Routed a video cable,Closed Node-2 Zenith CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System) flap (get-ahead task), Installed a gap spanner from ESP2 (External Stowage Platform 2) to the Lab, andCleaned up & ingressed.  Following the release of the Cupola launch locks, all seven Cupola window shutters were successfully cycled open/close, first one by one.  Then, at end of EVA-3, all shutters were opened simultaneously.  What a great sight!  (Congratulations, Thales Alenia Space/Italy!)  At wake-up last night, FE-4 Kotov did the regular daily “early-morning” check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-4 again inspected the filters this morning before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Later, Kotov also completed another periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]  FE-1 Suraev again downloaded accumulated data of the running TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) equipment, taking structural dynamics measurements, with Kotov photographing.  Later, Maxim checked on the equipment’s status.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]  Prior to the spacewalk, FE-5 Noguchi closed the protective shutters of the Lab and Kibo science windows and inhibited the CUCU C&T (COTS UHF Communications Unit / Command & Tracking) system to prevent interference with the EMU radios.  FE-6 Creamer assisted crewmembers Robert Behnken and Nicholas Patrick in completing their Campout stay in the A/L (Airlock) and preparing for their egress on EVA-3.  Steps included –  Supporting the hygiene break for the spacewalkers last evening (4:54pm-6:04pm),EVA preparations in the A/L (6:04pm-7:34pm)EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) purge in A/L (7:34pm-7:49pm),EMU prebreathe (7:49pm-8:39pm),CL (Crew Lock) depress (8:39pm-9:09pm),CL sortie for EVA-2 (9:15pm).  Post-ingress activities by Behnken, Patrick & Zamka included the usual post-EVA tasks like photographing EMU gloves for inspection, recharging EMUs with water, downloading & downlinking D2Xs EVA & glove photographs, recharging REBA batteries, reconfiguring the EVA cameras (FE-5), etc.  Continuing Node-3 outfitting, Williams worked on the Node-3 starboard IMV (Intermodular Ventilation) valve RMO (Remote Manual Override), adjusting the actuator handle for correct operating configuration.  In further Node-3 vestibule outfitting, the CDR installed the remaining Node-1 to Node-3 IMV and MTL (Moderate Temperature Loop) supply hoses.  Afterwards, Jeff closed Valve 2 of the THC IMV (Temperature & Humidity Control) IMV duct in support of activating starboard deck IMV.  Later, Williams had ~2.5 hrs for charging the Cupola ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) with ammonia coolant using the FSS (Fluid System Servicer).  Soichi Noguchi & Terry Virts configured the jumper equipment for transferring O2 from the Shuttle storage to the ISS, then initiated the transfer via ORCA (Oxygen Recharge Compressor Assembly) for ground-controlled operation.  Maxim Suraev prepared the DZZ-13 equipment for a run of the Russian RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) science experiment, then conducted another sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor) from SM window #9, later downlinking data and removing the hardware.     [RUSALKA ops involve calibration and tests of research equipment relating to the Sun and the Earth's limb at sunset (atmosphere lighted).  To be tested are the procedure for remote determination of Methane (CH4) & Carbon Dioxide (CO2) content in the atmosphere (in the First Phase), measurement of CH4 & CO2 content in the atmosphere and reception of data on NI2 and NI4 content over the territories subjected to natural and technogenic effects, reception of sufficient data on seasonal dependencies of tropospheric parameters being studied (in the Second Phase).  Equipment used:  Rusalka monoblock, Nikon D2X(s) digital photo camera; AF VR Nikkor ED 80-400f/4.5-5.6D lens with ultraviolet filter, bracket for attachment to the window, and Rusalka-Accessories set.  Support hardware: Device TIUS /DKShG/PNSK, Laptop RSK1, and Software Package loading disk.]  Suraev also started the new set of the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment, verifying proper operation of the BU Control Unit and MIS-LADA Module fans (testing their air flow by hand) and taking photography of the setup for subsequent downlink via OCA.     [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-15 greenhouse from Moscow’s IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]  The FE-1 had 2h50m for undertaking his 5th onboard session with the Russian biomedical MBI-15 "Pilot-M"/NEURO signal response experiment after setting up the workplace and equipment, with Kotov acting as Operator.  Later, the Pilot-M & Neurolab-2000M gear was disassembled & stowed away, and Max reported to TsUP-Moscow on his run.    [MBI-15 requires the Multipurpose Hardware Bench as a table, ankle restraint system, eyeball electrodes for an EOG (electrooculogram), and two hand controllers (RUO & RUD) for testing piloting skill in “flying” simulations on a laptop (RSK1) with software (v. 2.0) under stopwatch control, as well as for studying special features of the psychophysiologic response of cosmonauts to the effects of stress factors in flight.]  Oleg Kotov transferred the new Russian Glavbox (Glovebox) from Progress 36P and set it up in the MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2).  In the Node-3, FE-5 Noguchi uninstalled the AVM (Anti-Vibration Mount) launch bracket of the new CCAA (Common Cabin Air Assembly).  FE-5 Noguchi performed major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the ailing WRS (Water Recovery System) in the Lab, first clearing access to the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) work site, then removing the old RFTA and replacing it with a new 20A-delivered unity.  After closing out the work, Soichi filled the RFTA.  In the US Lab, Jeff Williams prepared the OGS (Oxygen Generator System) rack for its move to Node-3, accessing the OGS and purging it with the HOPA (Hydrogen Sensor ORU Purge Adapter), then disconnecting the O2 from the 3-way connection.  Kotov unstowed the Russian TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat #03 in the FGB, moved it to the MRM2 Poisk module and installed it for use with the new bioscience experiment BTKh-39 ACEPTIC, then took photographs and downlinked them via OCA for inspection.   Using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), Soichi performed the periodic WRS (Water Recovery System) sample analysis, after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.    [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.]  TJ Creamer performed another filling of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV flush water tank from Lab condensate.  With the Vozdukh CO2 scrubber failed yesterday, Oleg Kotov today performed IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the unit, replacing its BVK1 vacuum valve.  The repair was successful, and Vozdukh has returned to  nominal operation.    [The failure has been seen before, and the BVK1 valve was reported by the crew on 1/28 to have behaved irregularly.]   Soichi & TJ reviewed procedural material on the new medical experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), scheduled for them tomorrow.      [The experiment investigates samples from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crewmembers during pre/in/post flight periods for carrying out a detailed study of these samples, focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in a living environment.  Microbiota of these samples is thought to be strongly reflected by that of the ISS environment, which has a completely closed orbital living space under microgravity.  The MYCO experiment is one in a series of studies on exposure biology.   A number of microorganisms have already been detected in space stations such as the Russian Mir and the ISS.  Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. have been dominant fungal species in both of these space stations.  Both act as strong allergens in our living environment, and allergies that are caused by these molds are recognized as a serious problem from the medical point of view. Many researchers are studying the correlation between environmental microbiota and allergic reactions caused by an exposure to a living environment.]  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1/2x, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive device (FE-4), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6).  Reboost:  A reboost of the ISS stack by the Shuttle is scheduled tomorrow morning (2:29am-3:04am).   Sleep shifting started with the Progress docking on 2/4.  On 2/6, crew wake shifted earlier, to 5:40pm EST.
