ISS On-Orbit Status 10/31/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Crew rest day.   Ahead: Week 6 of Increment 25.  >>>>Today 10 years ago, Soyuz TM-31 launched in Baikonur at 7:52 GMT (3:52am EDT) with Yuri Gidzenko, Sergei Krikalev & William Shepherd, beginning the permanent occupancy of ISS two days later as Expedition 1.  TM-31 returned to Earth on May 6, 2001, with Talgat Musabayev, Yuri Baturin & Dennis Tito.<<<<   At wake-up, FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]    Also after wake-up, CDR Wheelock, FE-6 Walker & FE-3 Kelly performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]    Scott Kelly’s 2nd 24-hr urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol ended around ~5:00am EDT.  Samples were stored in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood & urine procedures for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]    FE-1 Alex Kaleri performed the standard one-hour leak checking of the docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and the DC1 Docking Compartment.   Afterwards, Sasha –  Opened the Progress/DC1 hatches (~5:15am), Installed      the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV)      of the docking & internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling, Powered down the      spacecraft and  Installed the      ventilation/heating air duct.    Fyodor Yurchikhin dismantled the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC1 (~6:25am).    [The StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB and DC-1].   Oleg Skripochka joined in by –  Performing the standard      air sampling inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M air sampler, and Taking photographs of the      internal surfaces of the docking cone of the passive docking assembly (ASP-B) of the DC1      nadir port, a standard practice after Russian dockings  [these images      are used to refine current understanding of docking conditions.  Oleg      subsequently downlinked the pictures via OCA assets.  The objective is to      take photo imagery of the scratch or scuff marks left by the head of the      docking probe on the internal surface of the drogue (docking cone, ASP) ring, now      rotated out of the passageway.  Before shooting the picture, the      cosmonaut highlights the scuffmark with a marker and writes the date next      to it.  As other crewmembers before him, Oleg used the Nikon D2X      digital still camera to take two pictures with the hatch partially      closed.]    Oleg & Fyodor then transferred two Russian high priority biotechnology payloads to the ISS, setting them up in the RS (Russian Segment) and taking documentary photography of each:  the BTKh-42 STRUKTURA      (Structure) with its Luch-2      kit  [BTKh-42      attempts to obtain high-quality protein monocrystals], and  ·         BTKh-43 KONSTANTA experiment with the Rekomb-K bioreactor  [BTKh-43 studies potential effects of spaceflight factors and their nature on the activity of a model enzyme relative to a specific substrate (bioreactors are specialized hardware for growing, cells, tissues, and microorganisms).]   A third high-priority payload, ESA’s SPHINX (SPaceflight of Huvec: an Integrated eXperiment) Biobox kit, was transferred to ISS/COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) by Skripochka and handed over to Scott Kelly for installation in the pre-heated KUBIK-6 thermo-controlled incubator in the EDR (European Drawer Rack), with VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) monitoring.     [Scott then reset the EDR and KUBIK drawer back to NOMINAL and initiated the SPHINX experiment.  SPHINX will determine how HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) modify their behavior in microgravity which could provide better knowledge of endothelial function, and be useful for clinical applications.]   Yurchikhin also began the transfer of other cargo delivered on 40P, tracked by IMS (Inventory Management System), an operation requiring several days.   Early in the Morning, Doug Wheelock swapped the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) EDV-U urine collection container with a recycled one (#499).   FE-5 completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].   Yurchikhin also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.   An additional task for Fyodor in the SM was the routine weekly inspection of the SVO SRV-K2M (Condensate Water Processor) hoses from the MF-R Diaphragm Separator Filter to the BRPK Condensate Separation & Pumping Unit.   FE-3 Kelly supported remote payload operations on the CFE (Capillary Flow Experiment) payload by turning on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starting the data flow, while POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center/Huntsville) routed the HRDL (High-Data Rate Line) system.  Scott deactivated the MPC after about 3h30m.     [CFE has applications to the management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.  ICF is one of three CFE experiments, the others being Vane Gap (VG) and Contact Line (CL).  Each of the CFE experiments is represented with two unique experimental units (1,2), all of which use similar fluid-injection hardware, have simple and similarly sized test chambers, and rely solely on video for highly quantitative data.  Silicone oil is the fluid used for all the tests, with different viscosities depending on the unit.  Differences between units are primarily fluid properties, wetting conditions, and test cell cross section.]   FE-6 Shannon Walker supported payload ops by deactivating the ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts) Shield dosimetry data collection for 10 min, then reactivating it.     [ALTEA-Shield uses existing ALTEA hardware to survey the radiation environment in the US Lab in 3D.  It also measures the effectiveness and shielding properties of several materials with respect to the perception of anomalous Light Flashes.]   Later, Shannon set up the equipment for the CSA (Canadian Space Agency) Vascular Blood Collection protocol scheduled tomorrow, her 2nd.    [Samples will be spun in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) prior to stowing them in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), after recording the blood tube bar codes.]   Wheels started another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.    [This was the 36th session with the GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 100 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]   Fyodor performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   CDR, FE-2, FE-3 & FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Fyodor at ~8:45am, Oleg at ~10:45am, Scott at ~11:30am, Wheels at ~4:30pm EDT.   The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]   No CEO photo targets uplinked for today.
