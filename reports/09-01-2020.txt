EXPRESS Rack Relocation:  The crew performed the activities necessary to relocate EXPRESS racks 8, 10B, and 11B to their final locations.  EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Racks are multipurpose payload rack systems that store and support research aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EXPRESS Racks support science experiments in any discipline by providing structural interfaces, power, data, cooling, water, and other items needed to operate science experiments in space.  ER 10B and 11B are two of three basic EXPRESS racks.  Basic EXPRESS Racks have been simplified to include only the most commonly required resources and feature more common connectors such as a standard Ethernet cable.
