01-10-2012January 10, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 01/10/12  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  After wakeup, FE-4 Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   FE-2 Ivanishin terminated his 3rd experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground. [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data. Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]   Before sleeptime, Anton will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 4th Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin. Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth. Anatoly will take documentary photography.  Shkaplerov, Ivanishin & Kononenko conducted the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement. Afterwards, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg were joined by CDR Dan Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device set up (and later cleaned up and stowed away) by Shkaplerov. [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants. By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ]  After setting up the necessary equipment in the morning, FE-6 Pettit was the subject for his first session with the periodic 30-min US PHS (Periodic Health Status)/Without Blood Labs exam, with FE-5 Kuipers acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer). Afterwards, Don assumed the CMO job to assist André with his first PHS w/o Blood Labs session. FE-6 then logged the data and stowed the equipment. A subjective evaluation was part of the test. [The assessment used the AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack), stethoscope, oral disposable thermometer and ABPC (Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff) from the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack). All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed. The PHS exam is guided by special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.]  After charging the FSS photo spectrograph battery, Shkaplerov used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9, taking pictures of targets along the flight track during a one-hour segment. [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module. FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.]  Anton & Anatoly joined up for an hour of preparation & execution of a session with the Russian experimental OBR-5 (Obrazovanie-5, Education 5) project VELIKOE NACHALO (“Great Beginning”), which addresses uplinked questions and comments from the Russian public on matters concerning human space flight. [Goal of this experiment is to develop a method to promote the accomplishments of national piloted cosmonautics using digital IT (information technology), for which RSC Energia has created a “Planet Korolev” website (http://gagarin.energia.ru/ ). The public inputs were/are the results of a questionnaire on this website. One interesting comment was the suggestion to create an Internet portal on which all still living participants of the first human space flight post their recollections. “This it is must to our descendants.”]  Oleg Kononenko worked in the Soyuz TMA-03M/29S (#703) spacecraft, docked at MRM1 Rassvet, taking out the ZU2A EA 025M memory/recording device (№ 62.073.014) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry system and replacing it with a new spare.  Afterwards, Oleg purged & inerted the SrPK (air supply tankage) Section 2 of Progress 45P (#413), docked at DC1, by charging it with N2 (nitrogen). [45P is scheduled for undocking on 1/24.]   Kuipers completed an inventory/audit of the ESA Thermolab Kit, to confirm that the on board stowage configuration is correctly reflected in the IMS (Inventory Management System), indentify how many consumables are left and locate a missing Thermolab Double Sensor (#001). [The items were to be extracted from their Kit, audited and re-inserted in the same Kit.]   Working in the Lab on ER1 (EXPRESS Rack 1), loc. O2, Don Pettit loaded new software (Release 8) for the RIC (Rack Interface Controller) on the ELC1 (ER1 Laptop Computer), with video camcorder activated to monitor the activity.   Later, FE-6 burned two R14 CDs (Compact Disks) and stowed them in the CD Library.  Don also worked with the ground in activating the SAMS ICU (Space Acceleration Measurement System Interim Control Unit) in the Lab ER1 (Drawer 2).  FE-4 Kononenko continued the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the MRM1 Rassvet module inspecting & cleaning “Group C” ventilator fans & grilles and replacing the SKPF1 & SKPF2 dust filter cartridges.  Ivanishin performed periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), verifying proper function of the Bubble dosimeters detectors and the LULIN-5 electronics box. [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (A21, A22, A27, A28, A33, A34, A35, A36) are deployed in the RS. The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies. Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]  Afterwards, Anatoly had ~2 hr set aside for conducting the periodic electrical plug-in audit in the RS, i.e. SM, FGB, DC1, MRM1, MRM2, plus PPS-31 & PPS-26 panels in SM, logging the specific hardware/equipment currently plugged in each power outlet. [Using an uplinked tracking list, FE-2 compared the onboard situation (panel locations, power outlet designations, users, operating mode, nominal current load) against listed plug-in data, updated the listing where necessary and prepared the file for downlink via OCA.]   After powering down UOP6 (Utility Outlet Panel 6) in the Lab with its connected equipment, Dan Burbank demated and removed the SPDA (Secondary Power Distribution Assembly) jumper that was installed last year for a possible decrewing scenario. UOP6 power users were then powered up again.  In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Don Pettit reconfigured the Ryutai Rack by powering off the Kobairo Rack MMA RSUs (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus Remote Sensor Units) and reconnecting the UDC (Utility DC-to-DC Converter) power cable to power on the Ryutai Rack MMA RSU for upcoming experiment work.  The CDR retrieved and pregathered equipment required for the extensive WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) yearly maintenance work scheduled for him tomorrow.  Then, Burbank completed the monthly maintenance of the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, checking its components, pin alignment, rack centering and the snubber jam nut witness marks. [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- & Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm; their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.]  Afterwards, Dan worked on the SODI-COLLOID (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument �C Colloid) hardware in the MSG WV (Microgravity Science Glovebox Work Volume) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), supporting ground-commanded operations by exchanging the DSC (Diffusion Soret Coefficient) Flash Disk with Disk 5 from the Colloid Flash Disk Container. [Colloid is part of the ESA triple experiment series of SODI (IVIDIL, DSC, Colloid) for advanced research in vibration effects on diffusion in liquids, diffusion measurements in petroleum reservoirs and the study on growth and properties of advanced photonic materials within colloidal solutions, respectively.]  FE-1 had another 1h 45m to stow trash and excessed equipment in Progress 45P.  Anton also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).  Anatoly performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM. [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]  Dan Burbank spent ~1 hr with Don Pettit in another handover session, which André Kuipers joined later for another hour, for their familiarization with USOS activities.  Shortly before sleeptime, FE-4 Kononenko makes preparations for a microbial air sampling session scheduled tomorrow and later with the MedOps SZM-MO-21 ECOSFERA equipment, initiating charging on the Ecosphere power pack (BP). [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger, power supply unit, and incubation tray for Petri dishes, determines microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies. Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge at one given time, the sample collection must be performed in two stages. Sample collection to Kit #А24 (Petri dishes Media 1 and 2) is performed tomorrow, after which the ECOSFERA battery pack must be recharged (charging time is 8 hours). On 11/20, air samples are collected to Kit #А25 Petri dishes per procedure.]  Burbank, Kuipers & Pettit took turns as subjects for their first onboard session with the 24S-delivered HMS (Health Maintenance System) Tonometry payload. First, Don acted as CMO to measure Dan’s & André’s intraocular pressure; then he was the subject with André as operator. The activities were supervised via live Ku-band video by medical ground personnel. [Data take was preceded by a skill refresher on an eye simulator, observed from the ground. Seven to 10 measurements are required for the Tonometer to calculate an eye pressure reading and the statistical confidence level. For the actual Tonometry, anesthetic eye drops (Proparacaine) are used that are effective in approx. 30 seconds and last for 20 minutes or longer. Tonometer measurements in micro-G will be used to assess the health of the crew’s eyes.]   FE-1 Shkaplerov performed his 5th collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file. [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log. Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]  In ESA’s COL, André Kuipers set up the partial equipment for the VO2max PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) equipment for his first VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) session, integrated with the Thermolab head sensors, scheduled tomorrow.[The partial gear comprises PPFS power, data, front panel, and gas connections. The experiment VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more. The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity. At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load. Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage. Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]  The three Russian Flight Engineers had ~1h reserved for more video shooting in support of the Roskosmos Television Studio’s project to prepare a film on onboard life.   Later tonight, the CDR will open the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment and activated the ISSAC laptop, so ground images can be captured by ground commanding. [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth. The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land. The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]  Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link). After about an hour, Dan will turn MPC routing off again. [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]  Before sleeptime, Shkaplerov will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 3rd Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin. Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth. Ivanishin will take documentary photography. [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data. Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 & FE-5 had their regular PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Anton at ~1:00pm, Anatoly at ~1:05pm, Oleg at ~1:35pm, André at ~2:40pm EST.  Before exercising on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser, Oleg Kononenko set up the G1 video camera to cover his workout session on the machine (not done yesterday), to meet the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.  Burbank performed his 3rd session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range. [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers. Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise. Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions. By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.]  The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).  The Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list for FE-1, FE-2 & FE-4 for today suggested more preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) target uplinked for today was Southeastern Australian Cities at Night (fair weather was expected for southeastern Australia at the time of this pass. As ISS approached the coast from the NW at this time, and for the next two minutes, looking for the large city of Sydney with Newcastle on the coast just left of track and the capital city of Canberra inland, just right of track), and Perth, Australia Area at Night (clear skies were expected at the time of the pass near the Perth, Australia area today. At this time, and for the next minute or so, as ISS approached and tracked northeastward over the coast, the crew was to look just left of track for this major coastal city).
