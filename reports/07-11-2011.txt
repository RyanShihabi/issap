ISS On-Orbit Status 07/11/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  Underway: Week 17 of Increment 27/28.  Crew sleep cycle shift:  Wake 2:59am, sleep 6:29pm EDT.  FD4 (Flight Day 4) of STS-135/ULF7. At ~5:53am-6:53am, the MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) Raffaello was transferred from the Atlantis cargo bay to the ISS and attached to the Node-2 nadir port.  The crew then activated the MPLM at ~11:57am and ingressed it at ~12:10pm to begin initial cargo transfers.   The successful transfer was concerted team work by ISS & Shuttle crewmembers:・         Ron Garan installed the CCR (Cupola Crew Restraint) at the CUP RWS (Robotic Workstation), activated VSW2 (Video Workstation 2) & VSW3 and SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) & SSC-19, and relocated VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) from COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to Node-2 for ground monitoring,・         Satoshi Furukawa was prime for powering up the CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System inside Node-2 prior to MPLM installation and removing it afterwards,・         With MS1 Sandy Magnus & PLT Doug Hurley at the controls, the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) grappled and unberthed the MPLM at ~5:10am and transferred it to the Node-2;・         Satoshi, stationed in Node-2, supported first & second stage capture of the MPLM by the nadir port CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism);・         Furukawa & Ferguson were prime for readying the vestibule between the Node-2 nadir hatch and Raffaello’s hatch for access, vestibule pressurization and vestibule leak checks; and・         Chris & Sandy then configured the MPLM for ingress and activated it. ・         Later, Ron removed the CCR, deactivated the workstations and returned VCA1 to COL. CDR Borisenko, FE-1 Samokutyayev & FE-4 Volkov conducted the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Andrey, Aleksandr & Sergei were joined by FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device set up by Samokutyayev.      [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ] Garan & Fossum began the day with a post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 24th for Ron, the 2nd for Mike.      [RST is normally scheduled one day out of every four with the morning test within 2 hours of wakeup and the evening test within 2 hours of sleep; however, in this round the crewmembers may complete as many as they wish.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Also right after wakeup, prior to eating, drinking & brushing teeth, Ron, Mike & Satoshi performed their first saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol of the new session, today again a liquid sample.  The collections are made every other day for six days.        [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] Satoshi & Mike undertook their 5th weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.       [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]  CDR Borisenko & FE-4 Volkov installed a new software application (PO) on the Russian RSS2 laptop for the automatic loading of uplinked antivirus software. The two crewmembers then performed the periodic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before today’s installation of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning will be verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Afterwards, Andrey removed and replaced the BPK transfer pump and line in the SM (Service Module), used to transfer condensate for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit. Borisenko verified proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data, then, after the MPLM transfer, downloaded the stored measurements.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises], Also as a post-MPLM transfer activity, the CDR performed the periodic task of downloading structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.     [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] Later, Borisenko supported the ground-commanded reactivation of the Elektron-VM O2 generator, first performing the usual buffer volume compression, then monitoring the external temperature of its BD secondary purification unit for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.      [The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H2) in the O2 line (which could cause dangerous overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.] Satoshi Furukawa transferred HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data files from the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for downlink to the ground.      [Since MEC files cannot be pulled down directly by the ground after the recent SSCv4 software transition, the crew has to transfer the files to a USB drive and from there to an SSC server for subsequent downlink.] Working with Doug Hurley, Ron Garan configured the Shuttle O2 supply equipment for PBA (Portable Breathing Apparatus) use on the ISS PBA ports for tomorrow’s EVA prebreathing. With VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) adjusted for covering his activities, FE-3 later extracted the PCDF EU (Protein Crystallization Diagnostic Facility / Electronics Unit) from the EDR ISIS (European Drawer Rack / International Subrack Interface Standard) drawer in the EDR rack and stowed it at COL Bay O2 (rack front). Other activities completed by Garan included �CPreparing the EVA cue card (printing & assembling), Retrieving a 300 mL sample from WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly / Waste Water Tank) via Process Line B,Cleaning NIKON D3s camera sensor,Calibrating the CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer �C Oxygen) units for their contingency use during pre-breathing in the Airlock prior to the EVA instead of the failed MCA (Major Constituents Analyzer), andPerforming the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose,  [after the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Mike Fossum collected condensate samples from WRM (Water Recovery & Management) condensate lines. FE-4 Volkov conducted his first onboard session of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (“Study of the Veins in the Lower Extremities”), using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex with orthogonal leads which Oleg Kotov had installed in the SM in February 2010.      [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Sergei set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump & valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a “body box”) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).] Afterwards, Volkov undertook his 2nd onboard session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.  Samokutyayev provided assistance and took documentary photography.      [For the session, Sergei donned the electrode cap, prepared his head for the electrodes, and applied electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] Later, after terminating the charging of the Piren battery started last night, FE-4 spent ~60 min with the Russian KPT-12 payload with its BAR science instruments suite, using the AU-1 ultrasound analyzer to check out microconditions of MRM1 Rassvet panel structures, then downloading the data.      [Objective of the Russian KPT-12/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-B is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] FE-5 Furukawa initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer) and deactivated the system ~5 hrs later.       [This was the 4th session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1001, after the previous instrument (#1004) was used for 37 runs after it had replaced the earlier instrument, #1002, which was used for approximately 7 sessions.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware. Afterwards, Satoshi deployed SODF (Station Operations Data File) book updates, for the Contingency Jumper Kit, E27/E28 Crew Handover instructions, and Medical Emergency Book revisions, plus WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) cue cards. FE-6 Fossum worked in the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment), performing the periodic changeout of the UR (urine receptacle) and IF (insert filter) with new units.      [WHC was unavailable for use during this activity.] Afterwards, Mike & Ron worked in the A/L (Airlock) to prepare the EL (Equipment Lock) for their EVA tomorrow (omitting drink bag filling for now) and reviewed the get-ahead task of PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3) thermal cover installation. Fossum later verified EVA tool configurations and prepared 3 D2Xs cameras for the spacewalk.    [Two cameras use 28mm EVA lenses, the third has a 10.5mm “Fisheye” lens].  Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Samokutyayev took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-1 used the Russian АК-1М absorber for the standard air sample collection during MPLM ingress.   Sasha also took samples of the cabin atmosphere with GSCs (Grab Sample Containers). FE-4 Volkov completed the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways to ensure the ventilation/circulation system performs adequately with the new ten-member station crew.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)�CRO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)�CRO, PkhO�CDC1, PkhO�CFGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO�CFGB GA, and FGB GA�CNode-1.]  Samokutyayev continued the current round of monthly preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, today cleaning the V3 fan screen in the DC1.  Andrey conducted a comprehensive 2-hr audit/inventory of SSGO SLG sanitary-hygiene systems, either for pre-packing used/expired items for disposal on Progress 43P or designating others (e.g., wet wipes, wet towels, dry wipes, dry waffle-weave towels, body washing kits, etc.) for priority use pending approaching expiration dates. Mike Fossum & Rex Walheim had ~1h set aside for Middeck transfers from Atlantis to the ISS. At ~3:00pm EDT, Garan, Fossum & Furukawa got together with the four-member Shuttle crew, Ferguson, Hurley, Magnus & Walheim, for a one-hour review of EVA procedures for Mike’s & Ron’s spacewalk tomorrow, with egress scheduled early at ~8:49am.  Instead of going through the usual overnight Campout procedure, Garan & Fossum will use the new ISLE (In-Suit Light Exercise) protocol for denitrogenation, designed to create efficiency in spacewalk preparation and tested by Fincke & Feustel on ULF6/EVA-3.    [They will perform light exercise for 100 minutes while partially suited, using masks to breathe pure O2 (oxygen) to facilitate purging of N2 (nitrogen) from blood stream and tissues.  This eliminates the need for campouts in the future.] For their ~6h30m spacewalk, Mike Fossum & Ron Garan plan to �CSet up SSRMS & tethersRemove the PM FRAM (Pump Module Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism) from ESP 2 (External Stowage Platform 2)Transfer the PM FRAM to the Atlantis cargo bay & install it on the LMC carrier,Remove the RRM (Robotics Refueling Mission) FRAM from LMC,Transfer RRM to SPDM EOTP (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator / Enhanced ORU Temporary Platform) and install it there,Install the MISSE 8 ORMatE-III (Materials ISS Experiment 8 / Optical Reflector Materials Experiment III) on the ISS, Clean up the SSRMS,Conduct FGB PDGF (Power & Data Grapple Fixture) troubleshooting, andInstall thermal cover on PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3) (get-ahead)Clean up & ingressRepress Airlock.] CDR, FE-1 & FE-4 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Sasha at ~11:44am, Andrey at ~1:09pm, Sergei at ~1:09pm EDT.  In addition, FE-3 & FE-6 had their pre-EVA PMCs via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Ron at ~11:59am, Mike at ~1:24pm. Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron Garan powers on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-1).  Mike’s ARED session was cancelled due to lack of time. No CEO targets uplinked for today.
