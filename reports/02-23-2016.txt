Space Automated Bioproduct Laboratory (SABL):  Today, for the NASA SABL facility,  Peake set up two SABL units in in the US Laboratory module and configured power, data, and thermal connections to the rack.  SABL is an upgrade to the long standing ISS incubator, Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA). SABL supports a wide variety of experiments in the life, physical and material sciences with a focus on supporting research of biological systems and processes.  SABL is capable of supporting life science research on microorganisms, small organisms, animal cells, tissue cultures and small plants.
 
Fine Motor Skills:  Peake completed a session of the Fine Motor Skills experiment today.  He performed a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet. This investigation is the first fine motor skills study to measure long-term microgravity exposure, different phases of microgravity adaptation, and sensorimotor recovery after returning to Earth gravity.
 
Water Processing Assembly (WPA) Catalytic Reactor Remove and Replace (R&R):  Kelly and Kopra performed a WPA Catalytic Reactor R&R this morning.  In addition, they took advantage of the access and replaced a degraded Gas Separator and Reactor Health Sensor within the Water Recovery System (WRS)-1 Rack, then cleaned the rack’s Avionics Air Assembly (AAA) inlet.   The crew was ahead of today’s timeline and proceeded with activities originally scheduled for tomorrow by installing a filter kit and performed an inspection on the failed Catalytic Reactor, then dried free standing water which was found within the unit.  The WPA Catalytic Reactor had been suspected of leaking since November, and had shown signs of increased leakage the past few weeks.  Ground teams have since activated WPA and will be performing a series of checks on the system overnight.
 
Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) Rope Replace:  As part of routine maintenance, Peake replaced both ARED cable arm ropes.
