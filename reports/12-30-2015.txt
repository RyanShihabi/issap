Cardio Ox Ultrasound: Kopra, with Peake assisting, performed his first (Flight Day 15) of three ultrasound and blood pressure measurement sessions for the Cardio Ox experiment. The objective of Cardio Ox is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis in astronauts. Twelve crewmembers provide blood and urine samples to assess biomarkers before launch, 15 and 60 days after launch, 15 days before returning to Earth, and within days after landing. Ultrasound scans of the carotid and brachial arteries are obtained at the same time points, as well as through 5 years after landing, as an indicator of cardiovascular health.
 
On Board Training (OBT) Emergency Procedures Review: The USOS crew practiced/reviewed emergency mask don/purge technique and demonstrated the ability to communicate with Mission Control Center-Moscow (MCC-M) from the Soyuz wearing an emergency mask. The crew also reviewed locations of equipment and positions of valves used in emergencies. During training, crewmembers consulted and coordinated with specialists at MCC-Houston, MCC-M, Columbus Control Center (COL-CC) and JAXA Space Station Integration and Promotion Center (SSIPC).
