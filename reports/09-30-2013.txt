Cygnus Status:  Following the completion of the Node 2 Vestibule outfitting activities yesterday, Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Parmitano and FE-6 Nyberg opened the Cygnus Hatch at 03:10am CDT today. The crew has since ingressed, photo documented cargo configuration, and started cargo transfer operations.
Emergency Procedure Review:  All six crewmembers took part in an onboard training session to review emergency procedures associated with Cygnus.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Mobility Unit (EMU) Hard Upper Torso (HUT) Water Line Vent Tube Assembly (WLVTA) Remove and Replace (R&R):  Parmitano successfully performed an R&R of the Water Line Vent Tube Assembly (WLVTA) on EMU 3010.  The task was originally scheduled last Tuesday. However, the crew had experienced complications with the removal of the Vent Tube Shield. The task was rescheduled for today, giving ground teams’ sufficient time to review photographs taken by the crew and modify the procedure steps accordingly. The preventative maintenance task is performed once every 4 years.
NanoRacks Module-9 Module Operations:  To prepare for NanoRacks Module-9 experiments, Parmitano along with Nyberg retrieved two modules delivered on Cygnus and reviewed NanoRacks On-Board Training (OBT) material for mixing tubes. The crew then activated the mixing tubes in both NanoRacks modules. This investigation results from a commercial Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) education program overseen by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education (NCESSE), called the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP). Student teams from across the United States design their own experiments using flight approved fluids and materials. The investigation consists of 17 different science experiments flown in a NanoRacks Module onboard the ISS.
