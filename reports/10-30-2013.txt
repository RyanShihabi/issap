Spinal Ultrasound Scans: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Hopkins supporting as the operator conducted Flight Day 150 cervical and lumbosacral ultrasound scans of FE-5 Parmitano with remote guidance from the ground team.  This investigation aims to characterize microgravity-associated spinal alterations during and after spaceflight using in-flight ultrasound. Results from this research will provide data to enhance crew health for long duration space missions.
Human Research Facility (HRF) Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device (SLAMMD) Body Measures:  Each of the three USOS crewmembers set up software and performed body mass measurements.  These measurements are used in support of Pro K and the Body Measures experiment.  SLAMMD provides body mass through the application of Newton’s Second Law of Motion (force is equal to mass times acceleration).  Two springs are used to generate a known force against a crewmember mounted on an extension arm and the resulting acceleration is used to calculate the subject’s mass.
In-Flight Maintenance (IFM) Crew Quarters (CQ) Clean: FE-6 Nyberg cleaned the Starboard CQ intake and exhaust ducts as well as fan and flow sensors. The activity is performed once every 6 months as preventive maintenance.
Periodic Fitness Evaluation (PFE): Hopkins and Parmitano successfully performed their PFEs today.  PFEs monitor crewmembers’ overall fitness levels, to ensure that cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health and performance is satisfactory. The activity consists of performing a graded exercise test on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS).
