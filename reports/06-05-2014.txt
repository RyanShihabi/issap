Microbiome Sample Collection: Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Gerst collected body and perspiration samples as well as surface samples in the ISS for the Microbiome investigation and stowed samples in the MELFI. The Microbiome experiment investigates the impact of space travel on both the human immune system and an individual’s microbiome (the collection of microbes that live in and on the human body at any given time). 
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) 3010 Return To Service (RTS): Commander (CDR) Swanson completed a 4-part checkout of the suit today. He verified successful installation of the Fan Pump Separator (FPS) component by performing visual water leakage inspection, structural gas leakage test at the maximum operating suit pressure and a long duration leak check. Ground teams will review data collected during the test to determine if the suit is ready to be returned to service.
Remote Power Switch Controller Module (RPCM) Remove & Replace (R&R):  FE-5 Wiseman replaced two RPCMs today:  LA1B-G, which powers the Rack Flow Control Assembly (RFCA) in the Combustion Integration Rack (CIR) and LA1B-A which powers the a General Luminaire Assembly (GLA) in the US Lab.  LA1B-G tripped open on May 13, 2014, and LA1B-A tripped open on May 26, 2014.  Both exhibited signs of the FET Controller Hybrid (FCH) known defect and R&R was determined to be the best route to recovery.
