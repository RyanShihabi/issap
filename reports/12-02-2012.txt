[After reporting the status of the SMPA/Charger 1008 after overnight charging, Kevin removed battery #1053 from it and let it discharge itself by powering the Driver Drill at high speed, later reporting the run time. The procedure was then repeated for battery #1051, to be left charging overnight regardless of indicator lights.]  Evgeny Tarelkin completed the routine daily & weekly servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.     [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings of SM & FGB for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers as required.] CDR & FE-1 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~6:00am, Kevin at ~12:15pm EST.
