ISS On-Orbit Status 04/16/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew rest day. Upon wake-up, CDR Kondratyev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 (oxygen) generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).      [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] FE-1 Samokutyayev completed his 2nd session of the MedOps PZE MO-2 24-hour protocol with ECG (electrocardiograph) & BP (blood pressure) measurements.      [After the ECG recording and BP measurements with the Kardiomed system, Alexandr doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Nespoli & FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 3rd for Ron, the 26th for Paolo & Cady.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] The crew joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of the uborka house cleaning, CDR, FE-1 & FE-2 completed regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM (Service Module). Kondratyev conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-5 Nespoli worked on the ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) hatch at the SM aft port, securing it on its intended support points using an adjustable bungee assembly from Node-1 stowage.    [The hatch has proven difficult to be positioned as intended.  New instructions were uplinked to Paolo for an alternate method of securing it.] FE-3 Garan spent ~50min with FE-6 Coleman in another handover session, their 4th, during which Cady familiarized her compatriot with USOS (US Segment) activities. At ~8:20am, Alex Samokutyayev had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). At ~9:00am EDT, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~1:10pm, Dima, Sasha & Andrey engaged in a PAO phone interview via S-band with Ekaterina Beloglazova, Editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos (Russian Space) Magazine and an old friend of ISS cosmonauts.  Jobs listed for CDR Kondratyev today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andA ~15-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining NIKON D3 photos with Nikkor 80-200 mm lens and the SONY HD video camcorder on oceanic color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Eastern Pacific, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5).

GENARA-A (Gravity Regulated Genes in Arabidopsis A/ESA):     No report. GEOFLOW (ESA):    For each of the first executed runs, set-points with high delta_T were skipped by the automatic script due to a PID control time-out on one of the parameters.  A second anomaly affecting the science execution is the occurrence of a FSL TEC power board trip.  Engineering teams concluded that the hardware can tolerate the trips.  Both anomalies are under investigation by the engineering teams.  In anticipation of a work-around, the engineering teams gave the go-ahead to execute runs which have a lower risk of tripping and which are restricted to a maximum delta_T which is lower than the desired scientific set-point.  Those runs are the so-called “rotation runs” and have the lowest priority for science.  Depending on the rotation speed of the experimental fluid cavity, the runs are classified as low (0.008 Hz – 0.16 Hz), medium (0.2 Hz – 1.0 Hz) or high (1.2 Hz – 2.0 Hz) rotation runs. On 4/11, a first low rotation run was started and successfully executed, followed by a successful medium rotation run on 4/12.  During the last 2 rotation set-points of the high rotation run on 4/12, the tray did not rotate anymore and the run was aborted.  Engineering teams reported that a possible root cause is slippage of the belt for the rotating tray belt, due to low tension on the belt.  On 4/13 the engineering teams decided that all rotation runs up to 1.6 Hz are allowed to be executed.  Together with the 2 previous anomalies, this further restricts the options parameters ranges (Delta T, rotation speed) to perform science runs for the moment.

SOLAR (Solar Monitoring Observatory):    Out of Sun Visibility Window.The SolACES team reported that they observed a significantly higher degradation of the spectrometers than before.  The suspicion is that external venting particles reached the optics. They requested to raise the temperature of the instrument around +42degC to +45degC for the current dark period in the hope this strategy would remove the particles.  SolACES temperature was changed on 4/7.  Later on, the science team reconsidered their strategy because they are concerned that the efficiency of the 2 affected spectrophotometers might improve, but this continuous heating might have a negative impact on the third spectrophotometer (this spectrophotometer showing the lowest degradation for the moment).  To preserve the functionality of the third spectrometer, the temperature of the SolACES instrument was set back to the standard value on 4/13.  The effect of the heating can only be evaluated at the start of the next Sun Visibility Window (currently planned on 4/29). The root source of the particles is not yet known and it is important to identify any venting, thrusters, vehicle traffic or any other contamination events from Columbus and/or ISS that occurred from February to March 2011.

CEO (Crew Earth Observation):    For Increment 27 through 4/13, 5,735 ISS CEO frames were received on the ground for review and cataloging.   “We are pleased to report your acquisition of the following target with a time corresponding to one of our daily CEO Target Request list:  Aurora Borealis, Alaska, NW Canada - a nice series of views of the rather limited display at the time of your pass - we will continue to ask for views of this  beautiful phenomena as conditions permit.  As a bonus within your Aurora session you also acquired several crisp views of Edmonton, Alberta.  Based on your interest and ability demonstrated in this nice imagery we will begin requesting city-at-night views in our future target lists.  Your striking, sun glint-enhanced view of agricultural fields along the Shebelle River, Ethiopia was published on NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  This semi-arid plateau region of southeastern Ethiopia is a most unlikely place to spot surface water features, but with your alert timing and exposure, a fairly elaborate agricultural irrigation grid near the river comes sharply into view.  Very nice shot! CEO targets uplinked for today were Bangkok, Thailand, at night (looking left.  The lights and coastline of this large port city should have stood out), Woollya Cove, Chile (HMS Beagle site.  Looking right among small islands south of Tierra del Fuego.  Charles Darwin stopped here in 1833.  Overlapping frames of the islands were requested), and Tehran, Iran, at night (looking left of track for this capital city at night).
