Gene, Immune and Cellular Responses to Single and Combined Space Flight Conditions-B (TripleLux-B):
Today Cristoforetti initiated the first of two TripleLux-B runs. The second run will be scheduled for next week. She placed the thawed Experiment Container (EC) Handling Mechanism (HM) in the BioLab (BLB) rotor and activated the rotor. TripleLux compares the mechanisms of vertebrate and invertebrate cells at a cellular level which causes impairment of immune functions in microgravity through induction of gene activation, phagocytosis (ingestion of foreign material), and DNA repair in vertebrate and invertebrate immune cells. TripleLux-B examines the immune function of the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), hemocytes (cellular component of invertebrate blood), compared to rodent macrophages (white blood cells responsible for eating foreign material) to function in microgravity.
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Window Inspection: Virts performed inspection and photo documentation of the JEM windows. Emphasis was placed on the exterior surface of the debris pane and interior surface of the pressure pane. Inspections were performed during both day and night passes and the crew reported no dirt or debris were observed.
Water Recovery System Recycle Tank Remove & Replace (R&R): Virts completed this planned maintenance to R&R the recycle tank in the WRS.
Lab Intermodule Ventilation (IMV) Cleaning: Virts completed inspection and photo documentation of dirt buildup on and inside the Lab IMV diffusers and inlet.
Columbus (COL) Centralized Cabin Filter (CCF) R&R: Cristoferetti gathered equipment and R&Rd the High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) CCF in the COL Cabin Heat Exchanger (CHX).
