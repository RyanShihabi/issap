Space Studio KIBO: The crew performed the KIBO studio setup with the X305 camera setup and recorded a live stream session for a JAXA TV show. The Space Frontier Studio KIBO is a broadcasting studio that is constructed and operated in the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), also known as Kibo. The studio can livestream activities, interactive entertainment, and communication from space. The program can receive uplinked video and audio from a ground studio to Space Frontier Studio KIBO, and downlink video and audio from space to ground.
Packed Bed Reactor Experiment-2 (PBRE-2): The crew performed PBRE-2 hardware setup and connected the cables and hoses in the Micro Gravity Science Glovebox (MSG). The ground will then initiate a run for several months using 2 science modules. The PBRE-2 investigates the forces acting on and created by a gas and a liquid flowing simultaneously through a column filled with glass spheres in microgravity. Known as two-phase flow, this side-by-side movement of a gas and liquid is used in a variety of space-based systems and equipment. Results could help improve the design of future mass and heat transfer equipment used in space.
