Radiation Dosimetry Inside ISS-Neutrons (RADI-N2): The crew retrieved all the RADIN-N2 dosimeters from the Russian crew and installed them in the Cupola. The objective of this Canadian Space Agency investigation is to better characterize the ISS neutron environment, define the risk posed to the crew members’ health, and provide the data necessary to develop advanced protective measures for future spaceflight.  It’s been recognized that neutrons make up a significant fraction (10-30%) of the biologically effective radiation exposure in low-Earth orbit.  The bubble detectors used in the investigation are designed to detect neutrons and ignore all other radiation.

S6 Battery Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations:  Today, the crew continued preparing for the S6 channel 1B battery upgrade EVA #1 by performing their equipment lock preps for Extravehicular Activity Mobility Units (EMU) 3004 and 3006.  This is a continuation of the equipment lock prep started Monday. The crew also completed their EVA tool audit, and Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) / Robotic Workstation (RWS) setups. Finally, the crew completed their EVA procedure reviews and participated in a pre-EVA procedure review conference.  The first of the two planned S6 channel 1B battery EVAs is set for tomorrow, Friday, June 26, 2020. The crew is scheduled to egress the Quest Joint Airlock shortly after 6:40 am CT.
