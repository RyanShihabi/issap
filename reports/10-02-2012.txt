ISS On-Orbit Status 10/02/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. CDR Sunita Williams started the day with another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 27th for her.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 & RSS2 laptops. Afterwards, Malenchenko completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~5:15pm EDT.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 9/12 & 9/13.] Akihiko Hoshide performed his 3rd (FD75) ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Resting Echo Scan in the US Lab, assisted by Sunita Williams who served as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) to operate the USND (Ultrasound) scans.       [Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable & VOX, Aki underwent the USND scan for ICV assessment, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera.  Heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor).  There are dietary constraints, and no exercise is allowed 4 hrs prior to scan.  After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed.  Later, the data from the two HM-2 (Holter Monitor 2) HiFi Cards and two Actiwatch Spectrums were transferred from the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) hard drive to the USND-2 USB drive.  Voice required last 5 minutes for crew to inform ground copy process is complete.  The USND echo experiment uses the Image Collector software on the laptop and requires VOX/Voice plus RT Video downlink during the activity.  Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD15, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).] Akihiko also downloaded the accumulated data from Suni’s 3rd (FD75) 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session of 9/23, from two Actiwatch Spectrums and two HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1).  The laptop was then powered off.     [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] FE-4 Malenchenko undertook the periodic (generally monthly) health test with the cardiological experiment PZEh MO-1 (“Study of the Bioelectric Activity of the Heart at Rest”) on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation & Stabilization), his 2nd.     [Equipments used were VPG/Temporal Pulsogram and 8-channel ECG/Electrocardiogram Data Output Devices (USI). MO-1 is scheduled 30±3 days after launch and 1-2 days before or after PHS (Periodic Health Status), always before exercise.] Afterwards, Yuri ran a test of the new Russian experiment TEKh-62 ALBEDO, using the FSS Photo Spectrum System at an SM window. Before sleeptime, Malenchenko initiates charging the battery of the TEKh-62 payload. FE-4 also supported the overnight test of the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) in the SM by copying the test data collected overnight from the RSE-SLS A31p laptop to the RSS2 laptop for data downlink and log file dump. After yesterday’s removal & stowage of the PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) Z0000 unit in SM (behind panels 225 & 226) after departure of the European ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3), Malenchenko today also dismantled the MBRL BUAP/Antenna Switching Controller and ATV CP (Control Panel) for stowage in the FGB. Sunita started preparations for tomorrow’s scheduled R&R (removal & replacement) of the OGS ACTEX (Oxygen Generation System Activated Carbon/Ion Exchange) filter cartridge, first gathering equipment & hardware items, then pre-flushing the new filter to remove contaminants (leachates) that may have accumulated during ACTEX cartridge transportation.       [Before the pre-flush, the WRS (Water Recovery System) hardware lines, i.e., PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Aux Port lines and WPA (Water Recovery System) water transfer common hose at Lab O4, also had to be flushed to ensure fresh iodinated water was used for the ACTEX flush.] Aki went looking for two CBPD Resupply Kits (#1003 & #1005) for upcoming ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) activities and located them in JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), loc. A5_D1, leaving them at this easy-to-reach site. To prepare for a possible repeat of a trip of the Lab RWS RPCM (Robotic Workstation Remote Controller Module), required for Dragon berthing, Suni gathered material to provide for an alternate power source, if needed, and reviewed CEU procedures that use pre-built cables from the ISS Pin Kit to re-route power to the CEU. After yesterday’s failed attempt by CDR Williams to remove & replace (R&R) the E-K Pre-Treat tank (resulting in several “Bad Quality” indications), Aki Hoshide today performed troubleshooting by performing an R&R of the DKIV water pump & the E-K tank with its hose.      [E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), CrO3 (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H2O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.] Suni’s work on the ER2 RIC EXPRESS 2 Rack Interface Controller) yesterday to install a new software load (Revision 8.0) on the RIC ran into an issue with loading the cards.  Suni will re-seat the cards and re-attempt the software load.    [If necessary, the ground will review old methods for software updates.  This is required for the ESA Meteron activities later in October.  The old method is a card-by-card method and time intensive.  Ground teams are reviewing steps for updating.]  Yuri had several hours set aside for more cargo transfers to the Progress M-16M/48P ship for transferring cargo for stowage (i.e., not for disposal).      [Since 48P is scheduled to remain docked to the station until February next year, it serves as a temporary stowage location for selected cargo items, all of which must be documented in the IMS (Inventory Management System) database.] Afterwards, Malenchenko completed the periodic (~monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control & Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO2 filter assembly (BF) with a new spare.  The old unit was discarded as trash and the IMS updated.        [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO2, O2, and H2O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.] Malenchenko also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] In addition, FE-4 took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). The CDR deactivated radiation dosimetry data collection with the Italian ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts)-Shield. Williams also set up the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) equipment in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) in front of the HRF-1 rack with Calibration Arm and Calibration Mass, then used it to measure her body mass, followed in suit later by Hoshide.  Suni powered off, disassembled and stowed SLAMMD hardware including the SLAMMD Accessories Kit.  This is a monthly activity.      [SLAMMD, performed first on Expedition 12 in December 2005, provides an accurate means of determining the on-orbit mass of humans spanning the range from the 5th percentile Japanese female to the 95th percentile American male.  The procedure, in accordance with Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion, finds the mass by dividing force, generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer, by acceleration measured with a precise optical instrument that detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing.  The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.  To calculate their mass, crewmembers wrap their legs around a leg support assembly, align the stomach against a belly pad and either rest the head or chin on a head rest.  For calibration, an 18-lbs. mass is used at different lengths from the pivot point, to simulate different mass values.  Crew mass range is from 90 to 240 lbs.] After setting up the Lab video camcorder to provide live “over-the-shoulder” viewing from the ground, Sunita configured the laptop-based Dragon ROBoT trainer and started it up for the 3rd Dragon Rendezvous & Capture OBT (Onboard Training) with Akihiko.  Afterwards, Suni & Aki debriefed with the ground (~12:00pm) and stowed the video gear.     [The training focuses on rendezvous operations from 30 m through capture, practicing roles & responsibilities for rendezvous and capture, executing the Back-away Cue Card, and practicing good hand controller techniques and successful captures with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System).] Yuri Malenchenko broke out and readied the equipment for his next session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), scheduled tomorrow right after wake-up.  It will be Yuri’s 2nd session.     [MO-10 measures the red cell count of the blood.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.] At ~1:50pm EDT, FE-4 had his periodic exercise-oriented PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- & Ku-band audio/video. Before Presleep (~3:30pm), Williams powers up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.] Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �CMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) to exercise recording target positions on the surface of the Earth, andA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.
