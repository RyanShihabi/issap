ISS On-Orbit Status 06/01/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sleep cycle is back to normal:  2:00am �C 5:30pm EDT. After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also during the morning inspection, the CDR conducted the periodic checkup of the circuit breakers & fuses in the DC1 Pirs module.      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 & MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 & BPP-36.  MRM2 & MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.] FE-3 Acaba started his workday with Day 5 of his first suite of sessions with the medical Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  Early in the morning Acaba concluded his first NUTRITION w/Repository 24-hr urine collection period, with samples deposited in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).  Joe also underwent the associated generic blood draw, then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the JPM MELFI (JEM Pressurized Module Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  FE-5 Kuipers assisted with the blood draw as CMO (Crew Medical Operator).           [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.] FE-2 Revin configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h 15m session, his first, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] In the RS, FE-1 Padalka supported the ground-controlled shutdown of the Elektron O2 generator.     [As part of the standard deactivation process Gennady purged the Elektron with N2 (nitrogen), controlled from laptop.  Elektron was turned off because of the deactivation of the BITS2-12 onboard measurement telemetry system and VD-SU control mode, required by today’s installation of the new BPI NU (Low Frequency Data Receiver) system.Note:  When VD-SU is turned off (and consequently BITS telemetry is not forwarded to the SM), the following equipment must be turned off to avoid operation in the absence of real-time telemetry:1. Elektron (shutdown by crew or ground).2. SKV air conditioning system (shutdown by crew or ground).3. Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal unit (no telemetry if in automatic mode, no impact if in manual mode).4. BMP micropurification unit (automatically shutdown).5. SRV-K condensate water processor (can be shut down by crew or ground, usually not required).6. BRI data conversion unit (smart router) is power cycled when VD-SU mode is cycled. 7. Due to the lack of telemetry, there is no dP/dt (pressure drop) detection in the RS. 8. Fire & smoke alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the PSS (Caution & Warning) panel speaker.9. Total pressure alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the PSS speaker.]Continuing his major outfitting work in the SM for the new BPI NU, CDR Kononenko today installed a new cable tree, replacing an old one which he prepacked for disposal.      [On 5/28, Oleg loaded new software (Version 3.1) for BPI on the associated RSS1 laptop and updated the BRI (Smart Switch Router) configuration file (v.4.2.2), supported by ground specialist tagup.  The software upgrade involves the BPI-NU, TVM-N1 (Terminal Computer), BSPN (Payload Server) and updated BRI applications.  On 5/29, the CDR then installed the new BPI NU and routed the required cable connections for the SUBA/Onboard Control System and SBI/Onboard Measurement System behind panels.  The new system will enable the RS (Russian Segment) to send telemetry data through USOS (US Segment) assets.  Testing will begin after 6/6.] After conducting a communications (“Ping”) test between the Russian RSS1 laptop and BSPN using the RSCE PingMaster application, Gennady supported the BPI NU installation by upgrading the software on the BSPN Payload Server hard disk backup partition with the new software version 3.1 from RSS1. André Kuipers worked in the JAXA Kibo JPM preparing the Ryutai Rack for its tilt-down, required for upcoming IFM to replace the failed fuse of the IPU (Image Processing Unit) valve motor, scheduled on 6/4.    [Removing and relocating cables and objects, disconnecting umbilical cables and connecting a Drip Bag in preparation for the rack tilt-down.] Afterwards, FE-5 made handwritten changes on four ICV HM2 (Integrated Cardiovascular Holter Monitor 2) placards when unable to find new placards launched on Soyuz 29S.      [The old placards had a misprint (erroneous color coding).] Later, André serviced the newly arrived CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) units, changing out their batteries and updating internal clock settings.       [The CSA-CP units will sit deactivated with new batteries for at least 24 hrs for sensors to re-establish bias voltages, and for 5-7 days in an open environment for sensor off-gassing.] FE-1 Padalka & FE-2 Revin had ~40 min set aside to familiarize themselves with the IUS BKS Auxiliary Computer System laptops in the RS, supported by ground specialist tagup (S-band).[The current laptop complement in the RS comprises:・        RSS1 (T61p):  Support computer , stays on 24 hrs; monitoring BRI and SM WAP, SW for BSPN, LF Data Receiver (BPI NU);・        RSS2 (T61p): Support computer, stays on 24 hrs; communication with BSR-ТМ, RSPI, Sigma, photo/video processing SW;・        RSE-Med (A31p): Medical experiments; not on network;・        RSE1 (A31p): Relaksatsiya, BAR and others; SW for Photo/video processing; not on network;・        RSK1 (T61P): Simulators ATV, TORU, RUS, Tipologiya Experiment; Sigma, SW for photo/video processing;・        RSK2 (T61P): ТК telemetry via SPR-TMI; Sigma, SW for photo/video processing;・        RSE-LCS (A31p): Deactivated until activity is resumed; SLS tests (Laser Communication System); US Laptops in RS:・        SSC2: Central Post �C US Network Support, MCC-H・        SSC1: port CQ (Crew Quarters)・        SSC3: starboard CQ;・        CSL5: Crew Support Laptop; Internet support; MCC-H・        CSL6: Crew Support Laptop; Internet support; MCC-H.] Using the SLM (Sound Level Meter), FE-6 Pettit conducted the periodic acoustic survey of several ISS modules for Week 5, taking a total of 54 measurements, then transferring the data for downlink (same location as SpaceX Dragon measurements).         [General background noise measurements were taken in the ATV-3 (4 locations), SM (12), Node-3 (8), Node-1 (5), US Lab (10), Node-2 (10), JPM (5).] Pettit also relocated a cable connection for the SAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System), moving it from ER1 (EXPRESS Rack 1) to ER2, then reconnecting a SAMS cable to the RTS/D1 (Remote Triaxial Sensors/Drawer D1) in ER1. Later, Don used the VelociCalc instrument to take IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) flow measurements in the JAXA JPM (Ovhd Aft Inlet, Stbd Aft Inlet, Stbd Fwd Outlet). With the SpX Dragon capsule departed from Node-2 nadir and recovered intact from the Pacific yesterday, Pettit powered down the RWSs (Robotic Workstations) in the Node-3/Cupola and Lab, disconnecting their DCP (Display & Control Panel) bypass power jumpers to conserve operational lifetime. The CDR took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Kononenko also conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Afterwards, Oleg performed standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in the MRM1 Rassvet, downloading the latest batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of yesterday’s Dragon unberthing ops to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] Later, Kononenko & Revin had ~1.5 hrs to begin the major task of outfitting the MRM1 Rassvet module with structural enclosures/containers (GK) for crew cargo items. Gennady finished his SPOPT (Fire Detection & Suppression System) IFM in the FGB, started 5/30, to access & remove three OSP-4 fire extinguishers and replace them with new units.     [The removed items were discarded, and the IMS database was updated accordingly.}  André Kuipers worked in the Kibo module, relocating stowed cargo to optimize stowage availability for new cargo to be arriving with the HTV-3 (H-2 Transfer Vehicle) next month.        [André consolidated hardware/bags to reduce stowage volume, gathered infrequently-used CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) for relocation behind hard dummy panels in the JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment) and moved temporarily stowed ATV-3 trash to the ATV-3 spacecraft.] FE-3, FE-5 & FE-6 conducted a session each with the U.S. HMS VIS (Health Maintenance Systems / Visual Acuity) testing program which uses an eye chart for both far & near visual acuity and an eye questionnaire (DCT/Data Collection Tool), to be filled out with test data and downloaded on a laptop for ground access.  It was Joe’s first, Don’s 2nd, André’s 3rd time.Oleg, joined by Sergei & Gennady for handover, completed the periodic (~monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control & Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO2 filter assembly (BF) with a new spare.  The old unit was discarded as trash and the IMS updated.        [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO2, O2, and H2O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.] Revin had ~1h35m assigned for another round of filming onboard “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7E camcorder and the NIKON D2X & D3 still cameras, part of the ongoing effort to create a “Life on the Station” photo & video documentary database on the flight of ISS-31 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include running experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] Making up for yesterday’s lack of time, Acaba had an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. Working on the MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) in the Lab, Don installed the EU (Electronic Unit) in the location for the spare unit.  Pettit also performed the periodic (~monthly) reboot of the SLT (System Laptop Terminal) laptop in the Kibo JPM. Kuipers filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), his 16th.        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~4:15am EDT, the crewmembers, except for Acaba, held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Main Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~6:30am, Don Pettit powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 6:40am conducted a ham radio session with students at St Mary's Catholic Primary School, Hay, NSW, Australia. At ~8:45am, André conducted the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with the EAC (European Astronaut Center) near Cologne /Germany. At ~10:00am, Oleg linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~12:50pm, FE-6 held the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists. At ~1:25pm EDT, Joe, André & Don conducted a 30-min teleconference with the ground to debrief their experiences and recommendations after the Dragon visit. At ~3:10pm, the crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston. Before Presleep, FE-6 will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (CDR, FE-2).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Joe Acaba performed his session on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill with the Treadmill Kinematics protocol, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video was later downlinked by Joe via MPC.       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] Tasks listed for Kononenko, Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C・        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop (Oleg+Gennady), and・        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb) (all). ATV/POTOK Deconflict Isolation:   With the recent (5/28) decision by TsUP/Moscow to swap the location of the two Russian POTOK Air Purification Systems of the SOGS Air Revitalization Subsystem and check out the SM POTOK (currently scheduled on 6/4), it became prudent as a precaution to isolate the ATV-3 temporarily from ISS power during POTOK operations and set it on autonomous power, to be returned to ISS power immediately after end of POTOK operation.      [The SM POTOK may have been involved in the loss of RECS (Russian Equipment Control System) power feed from the SM to ATV-3 on 3/30.] WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.    [The new card (31-0005F) lists 9 CWCs (70.7 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (no CWCs);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (4 CWCs with 56.7 L; and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets (number reduced due to weather systems, orbit geometry [low light in northern hemisphere] & crew availability) uplinked for today were Flagstaff, AZ (Cities at Night), Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs), and Kunene River Fan, Namibia-Angola (detailed mapping imagery left of track was requested to document the recent flood cycle.  The fan surface is lighter toned than surrounding landscapes.  Very large inland fans [radii hundreds of km], such the Kunene Fan, have only recently been discovered to be widespread on all continents.  Researchers are still in discovery mode in understanding river patterns and flood behavior on these vast low-angle conical landforms).
