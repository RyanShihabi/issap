ISS On-Orbit Status 04/10/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  FD6 (Flight Day 6) of STS-131/19A. Crew sleep shifting in effect – see below.   Saturday – full work day.    At wake-up (9:21 pm last night), FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime this noon, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]   FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson conducted her first session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]   The crew’s day was dominated by MPLM Leonardo cargo transfers, making excellent progress.  Main goal was to get all Lab rack transfers done before tomorrow’s EVA-2 in order to avoid spatial conflicts in the Lab with SSRMS ops:  Tracy Caldwell-Dyson      transferred the VCA-1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) camcorder from the COL      (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to the Node-2, mounting it on the zenith      “ceiling” for monitoring cargo transfer activities in the      MPLM/Node-2 area.    [Tracy returned it to the COL at the end of the      crew day and installed it on its seat track at the Port Endcone, aft      side.] Noguchi & MS4 Naoko      Yamazaki completed the transfer of five racks,- viz., WORF (Window      Observational Research Facility) to the Lab/D3, ER7 (EXPRESS Rack 7) to      Lab/P2, and 3 ISPRs (International Standard Payload Racks) from Node-3 to      the MPLM where they were installed by ~8:08am. Transfer of one ZSR      (Zero-G Stowage Rack) & installation at Lab/P4, scheduled for today,      was already completed yesterday.   [    For the WORF installation at the Lab science window (loc. D3) –  Tracy deinstalled &      relocated the CEVIS cycle ergometer, restoring it in its nominal place      after the WORF installation, and  Timothy Creamer removed      the Lab window flex hose cover and installed a pivot fitting for the      rack.     [The flexhose U-jumper, to fix a persistent mini-leakage      problem with the window, was delivered on Progress 13P and installed by      Mike Fincke in 2004 (9/17) along with its new protective cover.  The      vacuum jumper connects Ports C & D on the window frame.  The      interstitial volume “D” between the window’s pressure      panes was then evacuated to vacuum.  Part of the procedure was a leak      check of the frame with the ULD (Ultrasonic Leak Detector) equipment.]    The FE-6 continued his support of the APXC (Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit-Cambium) payload, today conducting Plant 2 operations.    [Steps included configuring the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) work surface area and retrieving the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System)  Root Tray and replant kit from stowage in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) for planting Segment 2.]    Afterwards, Creamer worked on the JAXA MyoLab (Molecular Mechanism of Microgravity-Induced Skeletal Muscle Atrophy - Physiological Relevance of Cbl-b Ubiquitin Ligase) payload, retrieving MEU (Measurement Experiment Unit) sample containers from stowage and inserting them in the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) for incubation, following detailed instructions.   [MyoLab studies a rat muscle gene modified cell line to determine the effects of microgravity.]   A third payload support task for TJ dealt with the DECLIC payload (Device for the Study of Critical Liquids & Crystallization) in ER-4 in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), in which he installed the dedicated DSI (Directional Solidification Insert).   [The French (CNES)/NASA-sponsored DECLIC, taking up two lockers, is a multi-user facility to investigate low & high temperature critical fluids behavior, chemical reactivity in supercritical water, directional solidification of transparent alloys, and more generally transparent media under micro-gravity environment.  DECLIC uses the standard infrastructure offered by the ER-4 rack.  Typical experiments for DECLIC include fluids (CO2, SF6) close to their near ambient critical point engineered in a dedicated insert (ALI), directional solidification of transparent materials (succinonitrile alloy) engineered in the dedicated DSI insert, high temperature, and high pressure critical fluids (H2O, NH3, etc.) engineered in the dedicated HTI insert.  DECLIC is designed for remote science control, commonly called "Telescience".  Operation capabilities offer scientists the possibility to remotely visualize and modify their selected experiment conditions in the ISS from User Home Base through the CADMOS User Support & Operation Centre.]   CDR Kotov performed the functional check of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the docked period.  Afterwards, Kotov copied the data to a USB drive, cleared the archive and downlinked the files.  The hardware was then restarted to continue taking data.     [Data calldown to TsUP/Moscow must be done once a day during joint flight of 19A with the ISS, the file downlink and restart every third day.  IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]   Later, Oleg powered down the equipment (BU/Control Unit, RBS/Power Outlet) of the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment in the SM (Service Module), removed its two KM root modules (A21, A22) and prepacked them for return on 19A.  The LADA greenhouse was then deinstalled and stowed after situational photography.     [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-16 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP), currently planted with Mizuna seeds.  Mizuna (Brassica rapa nipposinica) is a tasty variety of Japanese mustard greens, also known as California Peppergrass, eaten as a salad.]    The CDR also relocated three standard Russian TZK-14 Thermal Protection Jackets from the Soyuz TMA-17/21S spacecraft to the RS (Russian Segment) for stowage.     [These warm coats, always ready for an emergency return in cold climate, would be required for the landing in Russia or Kazakhstan in winter time.  21S is scheduled to undock on 6/2 with Kotov, Noguchi & Creamer, winding up Increment 23.]    FE-1 Skvortsov worked several hours performing his first preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems in the SM, using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush to clean first the Group A ventilation fans & grilles, then replacing the PF1-4 dust filters and later also cleaning Group B1 ventilators & inlet screens.   Later in the day, FE-3 Kornienko did his share by cleaning the Group B3 fan screens VV1RO & VV2RO in the SM.   Alex Skvortsov completed a periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]   The FE-1 also did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   CDR Kotov took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).   TJ Creamer offloaded the Lab condensate tank (to neutral point), filling a CWC, then also offloaded the WPA WWT (Waste Water Tank) contents into an EDV container from WWT Process Line B, taking distillate samples for return on 19A.       Tracy & TJ filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]   CDR, FE-2 & FE-3 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~7:26am, Misha at ~9:11am, Tracy at ~10:36am & 12:11pm.   Shortly before his sleep time, Misha Kornienko changed out the battery in CDM (Carbon Dioxide Monitor) 1020, installed the pump filter and then set up the activated instrument in relative vicinity (~2 ft) of his head in his new sleep quarters in the Kibo JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment).    [CDM will alarm if CO2 levels are greater than 1%.  The Kibo JPM is being sampled for CO2 levels, but not the JLP, and the ground wants to ensure that Misha is sleeping in a well ventilated area.]    At ~12:16am EDT, Skvortsov, Kotov & Kornienko downlinked two PAO TV messages of greetings, one to the participants of the Ninth Youth Delphic Games of Russia, entitled “We Remember”, to be held in the Moscow Region in commemoration of the 65th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War (World War II) of 1941-1945, the other to the participants in the celebration of Cosmonaut’s Day and the 50th anniversary of the founding of GCTC (Gagarin  Cosmonaut Training Center) at Star City, scheduled for 4/10.   At ~7:46am, after TJ had set up the HD TV equipment in the USOS (US Segment), he and Misha ran an end-to-end voice & video test of the comm setup in preparation for a Russian VIP Event from the VIP’s residence in Moscow on April 12, Cosmonautics Day.  The test was successful.   At ~9:16am this morning, the Shuttle crew held an in-depth one-hour review of procedures for the EVA-2 spacewalk, with egress scheduled early tomorrow morning at ~2:16am.   At ~11:46am, Rick Mastracchio (EV1) & Clay Anderson (EV2) began their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) in the A/L with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe (~11:46am-12:51pm) and sleep from 12:51pm-9:21pm tonight.  A hygiene break, with temporary repress to 14.7psi and depress back to 10.2psi, is scheduled for 10:01pm-11:11pm.   [Sleep for the ISS crew began at 12:51pm.]   The crew completed today’s physical workout regime on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE1, FE-3).  SSRMS Walkoff:   Starting at ~12:26pm, ground controllers “walked off” the Space Station Remote Manipulator System from Node-2 to the (MBS (Mobile Base System / Power & Data Grapple Fixture) 1.   Mission Extension:   The docked mission will be extended by a day, with undocking on FD13 (4/17).  The reason for the extension is that due to the failed Shuttle Ku-band, Orbiter TPS inspection will be done as a DLI (Docked Late Inspection), inserted on FD12, so that the ISS Ku-band assets can be used to downlink the imagery.     [Inspection and then undocking the next day protects the normal review cycle to landing time and allows 18+ hrs to downlink imagery before undock.  The late inspection data downlink and review do not have to be completed before undocking.  An existing minimum clearance limit of 5 ft between OBSS and the Orbiter has been waived since today’s ability to detect, correct and safe the SRMS (Shuttle Remote Manipulator System) for unexpected motion has been enhanced since the original 5 ft clearance requirement was specified.  Adequate view of clearance is available to the crew.  Minimum clearance during the late inspection will be approximately 41 inches.]  Wake/Sleep schedule on ISS (EDT):     FD   WAKE    SLEEP       FD6     9:21pm     12:51pm       FD7     9:21pm     1:21pm       FD8     9:51pm     1:51pm       FD9     10:21pm     2:51pm       FD10     11:21pm     3:51pm       FD11     12:21am     3:51pm       FD12     12:21am     3:51pm       FD13     12:21am     3:21pm       Weekly Science Update (Expedition Twenty-Three -- Week 3)   3-D SPACE:    No report.
