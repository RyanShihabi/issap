ISS On-Orbit Status 03/04/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FD9 (Flight Day 9) of STS-133/ULF-5. Sleep cycle shift:  Crew wake/sleep cycle continues to shift, returning to “normal” on 3/8.. Current schedule for ISS crew (EST): DateWAKESLEEP3/44:23am6:53pm3/53:23am6:53pm3/63:23am6:53pm3/73:23am4:33pm3/81:00am4:30pm  FE-4 Kondratyev started the day by undertaking the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] Before breakfast & exercise, Kaleri, Skripochka, Kondratyev & Nespoli each completed a 10-min session with the periodic Russian MedOps test MO-10 "Hematokrit", which measures the red cell count of the blood, with one of them acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer, Russian: “Examiner”).  Alex then stowed the equipment.  It was the 2nd session for FE-4 & FE-5, the 3rd for FE-1 & FE-2.     [The blood samples were drawn from a finger with a perforator lancet, then centrifuged in two microcapillary tubes in the M-1100 kit's minicentrifuge, and its hematocrit value was read off the tubes with a magnifying glass.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.  After the exam, the data were saved in the IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).] For Scott Kelly, Cady Coleman, Paolo Nespoli, Steve Lindsey, Eric Boe, Al Drew, Steve Bowen, Mike Barratt & Nicole Stott, it was PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) Reconfiguration Day 2, with a very busy schedule of back-to-back activities lasting most of the day.     [Activities included Lab cleanout, relocating a rack bay’s worth of cargo from the Lab to PMM endcone, i.e., opposite from hatch end (Kelly, Coleman & Lindsey), ZSR (Zero-g Stowage Rack) transfer & installations (Cady, assisted by Bowen), A1 Rack hardware installation for rack rotation (Boe, Coleman & Nespoli), A4 rack activities (Bowen), P4 ZSR transfer with cargo (Al & Mike), MELFI stowage shuffle and PMM F3 stowage reconfiguring (Nicole), etc.  Trash such as packing foam was to be stowed in the HTV2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 2) for disposal; other hardware such as FSE (Flight Support Equipment) brackets are to be returned on Discovery.] At ~6:23am EST, Alex & Oleg tagged up with their KTO Technical Support Team at TsUP-Moscow on S-band to discuss crew interaction issues during Soyuz 24S (#701) landing. Afterwards, Kaleri started a new round of monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems.     [In the FGB, Sasha used the vacuum cleaner and softy brush to clean the detachable VT7 fan screens of the three SOTR gas-liquid heat exchangers (GZhT4) plus the fixed GZhT4 grill.  The old cartridges were discarded and the IMS (Inventory Management System) updated.] In the SM (Service Module), FE-2 Skripochka performed the daily monitoring of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment which is taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle docked phase.  The data were later copied from the BUSD Control & Data Gathering Unit to a USB-D-M-3 stick for downlink to the ground.  The BUSD archive was then deleted and the DAKON-M restarted.       [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.] Dmitri Kondratyev concluded his 2nd session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiograph) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2 protocol, started yesterday.     [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Dmitri doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] Nespoli serviced the new CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) units which arrived on ULF-5, performing zero calibration on those sensor units which exhibited signs of sensor contamination after arrival.     [New CSA-CPs usually require time for decontamination (“outgassing”).  CSA-CP measures O2 (oxygen), CO (carbon monoxide), HCN (hydrogen cyanide), and HCl (hydrogen chloride)] FE-5 also completed the regular 30-day inspection of the AED (Automated External Defibrillator) in the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) rack.      [AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient.  It then can treat them through defibrillation, i.e., the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.] Later, Paolo worked in the A/L (Airlock), inspecting and photographing hardware that had issues during EVA-2, i.e., Steve Bowen’s leaky LiOH (Lithium Hydroxide) O-ring and Al Drew’s EHIP/ERCA (EVA Helmet Interchangeable Portable Light / EVA Radio Frequency Camera Assembly) suit disconnection, responding to specific uplinked questions. Also in the A/L, FE-6 Coleman cleaned up after the last ULF-5 spacewalk, stowing the EVA tools & equipment. Cady also took documentary photography of two Area Dosimeters deployed by her on 2/27 in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) at the aft deck starboard corner. Later, Coleman conducted routine service on the WRS (Water Recovery System) by offloading the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) storage tank from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary port to a CWC-I (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine) bag.  The PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) could not be used during the offloading.      [Estimated offload time: 23 min.] The CDR conducted the periodic manual filling of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV flush water tank in Node-3 (which took about 30 min).    [As always, WHC was unavailable during this time.] Working with MS-4 Stott, CDR Kelly swapped the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) units on ISS and Shuttle.     [After powering down GLACIER #003 on the ER2 (EXPRESS Rack 2), Scott replaced it with GLACIER #004 which Nicole deinstalled on the Aft Middeck.   Refrigerator #003 was then installed on the Aft Middeck, #004 in ER2, with power interrupts limited to 30 min for the Shuttle-to-ISS transfer and 120 min for the ISS-to-Shuttle GLACIER.] After reviewing sample transfer instructions, Scott & Nicole transferred return samples from the ISS MELFI to the Shuttle and stored them in the Fwd Middeck GLACIER. Scott also performed another weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.        [The current card (26-0045J) lists 114 CWCs (2,278.7 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (18 CWCs with 674.3 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 346.3 L in 10 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 170.8 L in 4 bags for transfer into EDV-RP containers via US/RSA-B hose, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only;  2. potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (84 CWCs with 1,555.6 L for reserve, of which 271.9 L in 15 CWCs are listed as “expired”;  4. condensate water (22.9 L in 2 bags, with 6.3 L in 1 bag to be used only for OGA, plus 8 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (22.9 L in 2 CWCs from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Kelly later completed the 2nd on-board CFS-A (Colored Fungi in Space) Fungi-A photo session.  After installing & preparing the photo & light equipment in COL plus mounting the camera at the Bogenarm fixture, Scott took pictures of all samples with different views.  The equipment was then dismantled and stowed, and the images prepared for downlink.     [CFS-A (Colored Fungi in Space A) determines the effect of microgravity and cosmic radiation on the growth and survival of coloured fungi species.  The Romanian experiment "Growth and Survival of Colored Fungi in Space" is based on experiments both on the Earth and in Space inside of microcapsules made by experts from the Romanian Institute of Space Science.  The fungal species chosen for experiments belong to 6 genera selected as organic material decomposers and potential contaminants of materials destined for interplanetary travel.  The experiment, which uses examination by photography in space (growth and morphology) and by post-flight analyses, should provide a better understanding of the survival of potential contaminants on space vehicles and of the growth of fungi in space for the solution of practical problems, e.g., disintegration of space waste during long missions.] Kaleri & Skripochka again had ~2h for another session with the Russian KPT-12 payload with its BAR science instruments suite, continuing to use the Piren-B instrument to check out micro conditions of FGB panel surface material to assess the necessity of panel replacement.  This was a repeat inspection behind FGB panels in areas where the Exp 23 crew had spotted signs of microflora growth on the pressurized shell.  Problem area monitoring is necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data were downlinked via OCA, and the activities were supported by ground specialist tagup as required.       [Objective of the Russian KPT-12/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-B is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] Dmitri Kondratyev completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Oleg Skripochka handed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Kaleri performed the (currently daily) checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways which is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently twelve persons.       [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1]. Kondratyev ran some test on the Elektron O2 (oxygen) generator, which remains off, to provide additional data to ground specialists who are determining whether to develop new troubleshooting activities or undertake an R&R (removal & replacement) of the unit prior to 3/9.      [Last night, Elektron experienced an uncommanded shutdown just after begin of crew sleep.   Russian specialists are looking at the data to develop a forward plan.  This Elektron unit was already operating on the back-up pump.  The primary pump had failed many months ago.  There is one remaining spare BZh Liquid Unit (#056) onboard, but its functionality is questionable since it has parts that were scavenged from previously failed Elektron Liquid Units.] After the completion yesterday of a four day Vozdukh R&R, the CO2 removal system was successfully activated and has continued to operate nominally.  For the first time on ISS, Vozdukh will be utilizing all three beds instead of being limited to only two.  Kondratyev today switched the machine to manual control mode.  Dima deployed the dosimeters of the new Russian radiation experiment Lulin-ISS for exposure, which he had broken out yesterday for battery charging.  Lulin-ISS is a part of the complex Matryoshka suite designed for sophisticated radiation studies.      [Dima set up the Lulin-ISS kit with four dosimeters (201, 202, 203, 204) with its BUI Interface Control Unit behind panel 121 and started battery charging for a preliminary data dump from the RSS1 laptop via the BSMM Multiplex Bus Synchronization Unit/computer.] After first flushing the sampling gear, FE-6 Coleman collected one urine specimen from each available Russian EDV-U urine container for return to Earth for analysis. Postponed from last evening, Paolo Nespoli supported the JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air) by unstowing three MYCO kits and distributed them to Mike Barratt, Cady Coleman & himself, along with 100 mL of drinking water from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) for each, followed by a joint review of the MYCO sampling procedures scheduled tomorrow morning.      [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO body samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss.] Dmitri & Oleg again had ~1h reserved for shooting more video footage on life onboard the station for Roskosmos, particularly for the Russian TV Channel Karusel (Merry Go-round).       [Footage today focused mainly on personal hygiene, station cleaning, and food, including crew interactions during the meal.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] Using the NIKON D2X digital camera with flash, Kaleri, Kondratyev & Skripochka took pictures of each other with the TEKh-43 Radioskaf-B “Kedr” microsatellite after setting it up in the MRM2 Poisk module.      [The small satellite was named Kedr in honor of the call sign of Yuri Gagarin.  It will be activated onboard the station on April 12, 2011, i.e., Cosmonautics Day, when the world celebrates the anniversaries of the first human flight into space and the first Space Shuttle flight.  Development, manufacturing and launch of Kedr is the first phase in Russia’s integrated program approved by UNESCO, with the goal to create and operate mini-satellites with a mass less than 100 kg by combined efforts of students across the world.  Once Kedr is activated, it will transmit 25 greetings in 15 languages, pictures of Earth, and telemetry data from science hardware and support systems, as well as historical audio recordings.  50 years after Gagarin’s flight all ham radio operators across the world thus will have a unique opportunity to hear the famous “Poyekhali” (Let’s Go!) from Earth orbit.] At ~7:08am EST, CDR Kelly, FE-6 Coleman, CDR Lindsey, PLT Boe, and MSs Drew, Bowen, Barratt & Stott supported a PAO/Educational TV exchange with student interns from POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) and NETS (NASA Educational Technology Services) team members at MSFC, Huntsville, AL. At ~10:38am, the combined ISS/Shuttle crew got together for a symbolic PMM Banner Signing with picture/video-taking, as an expression of gratitude to the Italian and US teams who built the three MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) modules, supported the past 10 MPLM missions, and converted Leonardo to the PMM configuration now on ISS.  The PMM Banner will be sent to Italy for exhibition.  At ~10:50am, the Exp-26 & STS-133 crewmembers held the traditional Joint Crew News Conference with U.S. media (~30 min.) and ESA/Italian media (10 min.). At ~11:33am, the 12 station occupants joined for the customary crew photo. The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1/2x, F-2/2x, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6).        [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is done regularly after the last T2 session of the day.] Transfer Status:   97% resupply complete, 73% return complete, 85% overall. Mission Timeline Look-Ahead:Mar 5 (FD 10) Extra day for PMM outfitting, OGS & CDRA maintenance, etc.Mar 6 (FD 11) Final transfers, crew off duty time, hatch closureMar 7 (FD 12) Undock, flyaround, late inspection, OBSS berth Mar 8 (FD 13) Orbiter FCS checkout, RCS hot fire, cabin stowageMar 9 (FD 14) Deorbit and Landing (nominal landing).
