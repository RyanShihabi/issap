ISS On-Orbit Status 02/07/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup this morning (~1:00am EST), FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-2 Ivanishin completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  Anatoly will terminate the process at ~4:05pm EST.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday.  (Done last: 1/18 & 1/19).       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hrs and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.] CDR Burbank & FE-5 Kuipers completed Day 4 of their (currently) daily electronic logging of diet for the Low Salt Diet protocol of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment and taking BMMs (Body Mass Measurements) with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device).  André then disassembled the equipment.  Blood and urine samples will be collected tomorrow.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included), the crewmember is ingesting one of two special diets (low salt & high salt content).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.  SOLO was also part of the experiments done on the recent Russian Mars500 long-duration flight simulation.] Anton Shkaplerov performed his 3rd MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) test, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, along with PZEh-MO-8 body mass measurement using the IM device.       [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM, the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with Sergey’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.] After setting up the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) and the Lab camcorder for recording his activities on MiniDVCAM tape during live downlink, FE-6 Pettit installed an expansion port on each of the three SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold, Engage & Reorient Experimental Satellites) satellites.  The expansion port cover plates were stowed, not trashed.     [Deferred from 1/27.] In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Don Pettit conducted another session with the CFE-2 VG1 (Capillary Flow Experiments 2 / Vane Gap 1) experiment, first preparing the MWA WSA (Work Surface Area) and then running the 2-hr test with the VG1 “A” vessel.  The session was recorded on HD (high definition) video, and the equipment was afterwards torn down and stowed away.     [CFE has applications to the management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.  VG1 is one of three CFE experiments, the others being ICF (Interior Corner Flow) and CL (Contact Line).  Each of the CFE experiments is represented with two unique experimental units (1,2), all of which use similar fluid-injection hardware, have simple and similarly sized test chambers, and rely solely on video for highly quantitative data.  Silicone oil is the fluid used for all the tests, with different viscosities depending on the unit.  Differences between units are primarily fluid properties, wetting conditions, and test cell cross section.]   André Kuipers reviewed background material on a new run with the JAXA “LEGO Bricks” EPO (Education Payload Activity), scheduled tomorrow for another demo session to build a model of a windmill. In the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), André configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware including MBS (Mixing Bag System), including calibrating the PPFS software and checking instruments, and then conducted his 2nd session with the VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, integrated with Thermolab (head sensors).  After the session, FE-5 powered down, cleaned up & partially stowed the equipment, and downloaded the data to a PCS laptop.       [The experiment VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.] Later, Kuipers reviewed procedures and hardware configuration for HRF2 PFS (Human Research Facility 2 / Pulmonary Function System) operations, then set up the PFM/PAM (Pulmonary Function Module/Photoacoustic Analyzer Module) and GDS (Gas Delivery System) and powered the hardware on for a thorough health check, with the ground monitoring via real-time telemetry.  Operations were captured with the COL camcorder on cabin video.  Afterwards, André turned the equipment off and disassembled it for stowage. Anatoly Ivanishin continued the current round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today inspecting & cleaning “Group B1” ventilator fans & grilles in the SM with the vacuum cleaner. Continuing their paced preparations for the Orlan EVA-30 spacewalk next week (2/16) and the suited dry-run on Tuesday (2/14), Kononenko & Shkaplerov –·       Activated Orlan suits #4 (Oleg) and #6 (Anton),·       Checked out the BSS Orlan Interface Unit in the SM PkhO Transfer Compartment,·       Checked out the BSS in the DC1 airlock compartment,·       Readied Orlan ORUs (Orbit Replaceable Units),·       Staged EVA gear (tools, equipment) in the DC1,·       Performed gas-liquid separation on the BSS cooling loops in PkhO,·       Performed gas-liquid separation on the two Orlan suits and the DC1 BSS cooling loops, and·       Configured two DSXs digital photo cameras, set up with 28mm-lenses and handed to them by CDR Burbank, for the in-suit dry-run on 2/14. Kononenko also photographed and took troubleshooting steps on the SSVP docking mechanism at the MRM1 StA-Soyuz TMA-03M/29S (#703) interface where an anomaly has existed since the docking on 12/23/11 (viz., a telemetry parameter showing the transfer hatch sealed/unsealed).      [For now, Oleg was to manually rotate the mechanism with a handle toward the Open position.  Software will be cycled, which should recover the monitoring capability.] In preparation for the Russian spacewalk, CDR Burbank took Anton & Oleg through another training session on the POC DOUG (Portable Onboard Computer / Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) software, especially set up for tutoring Russian crewmembers. .    [DOUG is a special application running on the MSS (Mobile Service System) RWS (Robotics Workstation) laptops that provides a graphical birdseye-view image of the external station configuration and the SSRMS arm, showing its real-time location and configuration on a laptop during its operation.] Dan had ~1h to restow the equipment taken off during yesterday’s ARFTA (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) mod kit removal.       [The return to RFTA use was made to use up spares.  The UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) will remain on RFTA operations until the RFTA consumables have been depleted (approximately 6 months).]  Afterwards, Burbank performed the periodic nitrogen pressure check on all three MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) units.      [Results: MELFI-1: 9,250 kPa (kilo Pascal), MELFI-2: 10,050 kPa, MELFI-3: 10,300 kPa.] CDR also performed regular service on the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment), changing out its UR (Urine Receptacle) hose and IF (Insert Filter), then vacuumed the entire WHC and cleaned it with disinfectant wipes.     [The old UR & IF were double-bagged and stowed for disposal.] Later, Dan took baseline radiation readings on two passive HRD (High Rate Dosimeter) devices, #1014 & #1015, by checking their memory registers. FE-1 Shkaplerov undertook the regular monthly session of the NASA CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics.  At the end, Anton completed a self-assessment questionnaire.  Answers were then provided at test conclusion.        [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] FE-2 Ivanishin completed the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWC (Collapsible Water Container) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV will be connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.     [Condensate was drawn from CWCs #1083 (5 L), #1077 (40 L) & #1071 (40 L).  The 40-minute procedure is specially designed for gas/liquid separation, i.e., to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.] Anatoly also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Oleg took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). André had ~1h for more transferring & unpacking US cargo delivered on Progress 46P. On TsUP Go, FE-2 was to refresh ISS cabin atmosphere with another O2 repress from Progress M-14/46P (#414) SRPK tankage. After draining disinfectant solution from the SM Rodnik BV1 water tank yesterday, Anatoly today set up the pumping equipment with electric compressor #41 and transferred water from Progress 46P stores to the SM BV1, then conducted the standard bladder compression & leak check on the emptied Progress BV1 tank, preparatory for receiving liquid waste (urine).      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.] Ivanishin performed periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), verifying proper function of the radiation detectors by taking readings from the LULIN-5 electronics box located in the MRM1 Rassvet module near the spherical “phantom”.      [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (A21, A22, A27, A28, A33, A34, A35, A36) are deployed in the RS.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.] Kononenko performed his 4th data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.         [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] Don Pettit was to address a number of questions by ground personnel analyzing the failure of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) rope on 1/26.    [When the ARED cable arm ropes were replaced on 1/26, the exercise rope was found failed and was also replaced.  The failed rope was a redesigned model that was intended to have longer life and not fray as easily as the previous design.  Engineers were surprised at the premature failure as ground testing certified the exercise rope for approximately 2.6 years with six crew use. This rope failed after 187 days of use.] FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 & FE-5 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, André at ~4:35 am, Anton at ~11:00am, Oleg at ~12:00pm, Anatoly at ~12:35pm EST. Before Presleep, Don Pettit will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don will turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Don had another time slot reserved for making entries in their electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Before sleeptime, Anatoly will initiate battery charging for the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware.     [The FSS system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).  After his T2 session, Pettit closed down the T2 software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display. Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Papandayan volcanoes, Volcanoes Galeras, Reventador, Tanguraua, Sangay Volcano, Hudson volcano and Patagonian glaciers,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). RS Propellant Transfer:     After yesterday’s transfer of fuel (UDMH/unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) transfer from the 46P cargo ship to the SM BG1 tank (10:22am-7:43pm) with compressor K3 and today’s transfer of oxidizer (N2O4 or NTO, nitrogen tetroxide) to SM tank BO2 (9:25am-6:47pm) with compressor K2, another fuel transfer will take place tomorrow (8:28am-5:50pm) to BG1, followed later by oxidizer transfer to BO2, with BITS2-12 onboard realtime telemetry system and VD-SU mode off.    [When VD-SU mode is deactivated and BITS is powered down, affected equipment must be turned off to avoid operation in the absence of real-time telemetry. The most notable impacts are: Elektron oxygen generation system (shutdown by crew or ground),SKV air conditioning system (shutdown by crew or ground).Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal unit (no telemetry if in automatic mode, no impact if in manual mode).BMP micropurification unit (automatically shutdown).SRV-K condensate water processor (can be shut down by crew or ground, usually not required).BRI data conversion unit (smart router) is power cycled when VD-SU mode is cycled. After VD-SU activation, the crew may execute a test to assess the impact of VD-SU mode cycling on the BRI,No dP/dt (pressure change) detection in RS due to the lack of telemetry, Fire & smoke alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the C&W panel (PSS) speaker,Total pressure alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the C&W panel (PSS) speaker.]CEO (Crew Earth Observation) target uplinked for today was Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, Western Pacific Ocean (DYNAMIC EVENT:  Looking right, off track, for 4–5 mins for this well-formed storm, located west of Vanuatu.  Jasmine was expected to become a category 1 storm by the time of this pass, when it will start impacting islands in Vanuatu.  Low dawn sun angles should reveal its structure well.  The next pass provided another opportunity to see the storm, look to your left during this past.  [Note: Ocean hemisphere passes, restricted imaging times and regional clouds in many parts of the globe precluded numerous targets for today.])
