ISS On-Orbit Status 11/07/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway:  Week 8 of Increment 29 (three-person crew)   After wakeup, FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Next, the Russian Flight Engineer conducted the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Sergey was joined by Mike Fossum & Satoshi Furukawa in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device set up (and later cleaned up and stowed away) by Volkov.       [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ] Also early in Postsleep, Furukawa & Fossum undertook their 21st weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.        [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]  Fossum checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera & flashlight battery charge and again 8 hrs later at midday and before sleeptime.  The Nikon D2Xs camera with EarthKAM software running with the Intervalometer on SSC-18 is taking automated flash photography.       [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking one photo each hour of Sample 2 (since 11/2).  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.] Preparatory to the scheduled installation of a jumper cable for the SPDA (Secondary Power Distribution Assembly) at LA1B, Fossum powered down all equipment connected to the Lab UOP-6 (Utility Outlet Panel 6).  This affected SSC-12 (Station Support Computer 12) and SSC-18 laptops plus the dual Li-Ion (Lithium-Ion) battery charger.  Afterwards, Mike had 2h set aside for an IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of installing the Lab SPDA jumper and Node-1 Y-jumper to power the SPDA using Lab Payload Rack power (at P1).      [The Lab SPDA jumper consists of two jumpers mated together with the connection taped over due to grounding concerns. One end was to be mated to the LA1B SPDA located in the Fwd Stbd Endcone, the other end to the Node-1 Y-jumper.  One end of the ‘Y’ of the latter was then to be mated to the J1 connection at P1, the second end was capped.  The IFM required safing steps, rotating the MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) rack at S1 down for access after demating its umbilicals, removing the shear panel in front of the SPDA at LA1B (38 fasteners), then installing the jumpers and reversing the activities (without re-attaching the shear panel).  The temporarily deactivated Lab UOP-6 was powered up later in the day, and ground teams then were to recover the powered-down UOP-6 loads.] Later, Mike swapped quarter box modules in MELFI-3 Dewar 2/Tray D with a half-box module after relocating the -32 degC Ice Bricks (green) from the former into the latter. Meanwhile, Volkov & Furukawa spent ~2 hrs in the Soyuz TMA-02M/27S (#703) Descent Module, docked at MRM1, to conduct the Soyuz descent drill, a standard training exercise for every crew returning on this spacecraft, supported by ground tagups.  Each of the two crewmembers had three runs.  Results of the exercise, which strictly forbids any command activation (except for switching the InPU display on the Neptun-ME console), were subsequently reported to ground control at TsUP/Moscow.  Return equipment list and stowage were also discussed with the ground.       [The session includes a review of the pertinent ODFs (operational data files), specifically the books on Soyuz Ascent & Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situations, crew responsibilities when executing the flight program, visual crew recognition of SUS (Entry Control System) failures, spacesuit procedures, etc., with special emphasis on operations with the Neptune-ME cockpit console.  The training uses a Descent Simulator application (Trenasher Spusk =”descent trainer”) on the RSK1 laptop.  27S will undock on 11/22 at ~9:21pm EST and land in Kazakhstan shortly afterwards. ] Sergey Volkov took his 5th MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) test, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, along with PZEh-MO-8 body mass measurement using the IM device.       [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM, the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with Sergey’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.] Later, FE-4 checked out proper MKSD Control & Data Acquisition Module communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, then copied science & service data, accumulated from the GFI-17 Molniya-GAMMA (“Lightning-GAMMA”) experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28, over to external media (16 GB flash card).  Later (~12:25pm EST), he initiated their downlink from the RSK1 laptop to the ground via OCA.       [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.] In preparation for their return on Soyuz 27S in 15 days, Sergey, Mike & Satoshi donned their intravehicular Sokol pressure suits and performed a fit-check in their body-contoured Kazbek couches in the spacecraft, a 20-min job. Furukawa began his 4th (and final) Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment, assisted by Mike Fossum as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres. At ~10:05am EST, Satoshi observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.         [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Satoshi started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] In Node-3, Fossum serviced the WRS (Water Recovery System) Rack 2, filling the WSTA (Waste Storage Tank Assembly) to top off the Recycle Tank, then reconfigured the ARFTA (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) with QD (Quick Disconnect) hose from the periodic backfill mode to UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) processing mode. After reviewing applicable payload procedures and training material, Satoshi visually inspected and activated the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), adjusted the G1 video camera to transmit his activities on Ku-band to the console team on the ground and then set up the SODI-COLLOID (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument – Colloid) hardware in the MSG WV (Work Volume) for ground-commanded operations.       [Colloid is part of the ESA triple experiment series of SODI (IVIDIL, DSC, Colloid) for advanced research in vibration effects on diffusion in liquids, diffusion measurements in petroleum reservoirs and the study on growth and properties of advanced photonic materials within colloidal solutions, respectively.] Sergey completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Mike powered on the laptop of the ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera) laptop for ground commanding, after coordinating, via telemetry, with the PRO (Payload Rack Officer) at POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center).      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] Sergey, Mike & Satoshi again had an hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers. Before Presleep, Fossum will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Mike will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5). Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Taking care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), andConducting the daily inspection of the running Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. RS Propellant Transfer:     Starting this morning at ~12:24am EST, TsUP/Moscow transferred fuel (UDMH/unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) from the 45P cargo ship’s propellant system via the DC1 (Docking Compartment) to the SM BG1 fuel tank of the ODU (Integrated Propulsion System).  Later tonight, at ~11:23pm, transfer of oxidizer (N2O4 or NTO, nitrogen tetroxide) to SM tank BO1 will be started. KURS-P Test:    Also this morning, Russian ground controllers conducted a test of the KURS-P automated docking system via Regul VHF and RGS (Russian Groundsites) using the Approach Test Program (CSB) to check out the recent (11/3) switch of the KURS antenna feeder cables to the SM +Y-side (MRM2) for next week’s Soyuz 28S docking (11/16). No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
