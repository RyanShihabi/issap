ISS On-Orbit Status 07/28/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      For today and tomorrow, the crew has again been split in two shifts, in order to provide support to the Progress M-15M/47P redocking activity:   Crew 1 (Padalka, Revin, Malenchenko):Wake1 –  2:00am EDT (this morning)Sleep1 –  11:15am (today) Wake2 –  4:15pm (today)Sleep2 – 10:30pm (today)Wake3 – 7:30am (tomorrow)Sleep3 – 8:40pm (tomorrow)Wake4 – 2:00am (Monday) – returning to nominal. Crew 2 (Acaba, Williams, Hoshide):Wake1 –  2:00am EDT (this morning)Sleep1 –  5:30pm (today) Wake2 –  7:45pm (today)Observe 47P Re-dock – 7:45pm-9:15pm (today)Sleep2 – 9:15pm (today)Wake3 – 3:30am (tomorrow)Sleep3 – 5:30pm (tomorrow)Wake4 – 2:00am (Monday) – returning to nominal. At wakeup, Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  FE-2 also conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. In preparation for the re-docking of Progress M-15M/47P (#415) at the DC1 port after more ground-controlled tests of its new Kurs-NA antenna (tonight at ~9:00pm EDT), Malenchenko & Padalka worked through the standard 3h15m OBT (Onboard Training) drill for the TORU teleoperator system, which provides a manual backup mode to the Progress’ KURS automated rendezvous radar system.    [TORU will not be used any earlier than 400m from the ISS.]   After the successful capture & berthing of JAXA’s HTV3 (H-IIB Transfer Vehicle 2) “Kounotori 3“ (Stork 3) yesterday at 8:23am EDT, the HTV3 was successfully transitioned from internal batteries to ISS power to prevent further drain on its non-rechargeable batteries.   FE-6 Hoshide & FE-5 Williams performed the vestibule outfitting, including removal of the CDC (Center Disk Cover), mating of a power jumper and a MIL-STD-1553 data jumper from Node-2 to HTV, etc.   HTV3 hatch was opened today at ~4:05am.  Suni Williams, Aki Hoshide & Joe Acaba ingressed the HTV at ~4:15am.  FE-2 Revin sampled the air in the HTV using a Russian AK-1M absorber.    [The crew used gray tape to secure the Node-2 nadir/HTV Radial Port Closeout in place to avoid interference with the HTV hatch alignment guides.] FE-6 Hoshide started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.       [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] During his first work period (2:00am-11:15am), Sergei Revin completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] During their workhours (2:00am-5:30pm), FE-5 Williams deactivated the amateur/ham radio stations in the SM and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to prevent RF interference during Progress re-docking, and FE-6 Hoshide closed the shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows as protection against thruster effluent contamination. Joe, Suni & Aki began with the transfer of cargo items delivered on HTV3.    [Between the three of them, they spent ~12 hrs above the scheduled time today on HTV Cargo Ops.] With Joe taking documentary photography, Suni unstowed the critical new YTSL (YouTube SpaceLab) payload with its live occupants from HTV3 and installed its Spider Habitats 1 & 2, with running commentary.      [Both spider habitats were installed in CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4), followed by feeding of the spiders, with video & still photographs being taken.  Recorded HD video is required during entire activity, to be downlinked when resources are available.] Williams & Hoshide had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) scheduled, via S-and/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Aki at ~11:25am, Suni at ~3:55pm EDT. The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).  Progress 47P Redocking:   All activities are on schedule for the 47P redocking for 9:00 pm EDT tonight.  The Russian crewmembers are standing by for taking over with TORU if necessary.  Joe, Suni & Aki are also awake to observe the automated docking.  Kurs activation was at 7:00 pm EDT.  At ~7:54 EDT, there is an important check of the Kurs system at ~45 km out.      [Main cause for the Kurs anomalies during the first re-docking attempt was the thermal environment impact on the Kurs-NA system.  If the Kurs-NA equipment is warm enough then it behaves nominally.  This was verified by ground testing.  The Russians also successfully activated Kurs-NA on orbit the other day after letting the equipment warm up first.  Other than temperature, the configuration of the Kurs-NA equipment for re-docking will be exactly the same as the first attempt.] Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-Two – Week 4). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD Shielding (NASA/ASI):     On GMT201, one of the Silicon Detector Units (SDU #1) went off.  “Thank you, Aki, for recovering on GMT202!”  However on GMT203-204, SDU#2 went off, this is the reference detector without shielding tiles.  Since this removes the comparison reference for the detectors with shielding tiles, this has science impact.  Recovery activity is in work.  To date, around 42 cumulative days of measurements have been performed.  Session#1 must be pursued for a minimum of 40-60 cumulative days, hence the minimum required duration on the first location has been met.       [Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):    No report.

Asian Seed 2010 (JAXA):    Returned on ULF6. BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      We ran four tests this week at different air and GN2 flows.  The first test was a high flow rate test.  The flame did not blow off, but instead became a sooty, comet-shaped flame that surrounded the sphere.   Gaseous nitrogen blew out the stagnation region but not the wake region.   Lower flow rate tests were also performed with incrementally increasing nitrogen suppressant, and we determined the nitrogen flow rate where the stagnation region blew off.  In one of these lower flow rate tests, we blew off the entire flame with nitrogen, but for a duplicate test with a longer burn time (more preheating) the nitrogen was not able to blow off the flame at the same 5 cm/s air flow.  This demonstrates that fuel preheating increases the difficulty to suppress the flame.  Unfortunately, we broke another igniter wire.   We have two left, one standard length and one long, each with a coil igniter geometry.  We are replanning the test priority and test matrix order given the limited number of remaining igniters.  We have manifested more igniters on the first SpaceX launch which should enable us to complete our test matrix.  The most recent flow calibration performed this week indicated increased resistance, so we will perform soot removal next week.  Recent images show the effect of nitrogen application on a flame burning a 2-cm acrylic sphere in the wake configuration.  The flame is established for a few seconds, and then nitrogen is applied at the maximum flow rate of 500 cc/min.  The nitrogen weakens the flame substantially and nearly extinguished it, but it is then able to recover, even with the nitrogen flowing.  When the nitrogen is shut off, the flame intensifies.  Finally, turning the air flow off extinguishes the flame. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
