Sally Ride Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle Schools (EarthKAM): The crew deactivated and stowed the EarthKam hardware. EarthKAM allows thousands of students to photograph and examine Earth from a space crew’s perspective. Using the Internet, the students control a special digital camera mounted on-board the ISS. This enables them to photograph the Earth’s coastlines, mountain ranges and other geographic items of interest from the unique vantage point of space. The EarthKAM team then posts these photographs on the Internet for viewing by the public and participating classrooms around the world.

Northrop Grumman (NG)-14 Mission:  NG-14 Cygnus vehicle (S.S. Kalpana Chawla) rendezvoused with the ISS and was captured by the ISS Crew utilizing the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) at 4:32 am CT.  Following capture, the Cygnus spacecraft was maneuvered and berthed to the Node 1 nadir Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) by Robotics Ground Controllers and fully integrated with the ISS.  Once integrated, the crew ingressed the Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM) to transfer time critical payloads and cold bags from Cygnus to the ISS. The Cygnus NG-14 mission is part of the Commercial Resupply Services-2 (CRS-2) contract and is expected to be berthed to ISS until December 16, 2020.
