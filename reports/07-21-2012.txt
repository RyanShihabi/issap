ISS On-Orbit Status 07/21/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew light duty.  Sleep cycle shift (1 hr fwd) –  Sleep: 6:30pm (last night); wake: 3:00am today; sleep: 5:30pm (back to normal).   Today one year ago (2011), Shuttle Atlantis landed at KSC, marking the end of the magnificent 30-year Space Shuttle Program. HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3) Launch:   The H-IIB carrier rocket with the HTV3 launched successfully from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan last night at 10:06 pm EDT.  HTV3 activation and initial checkout were completed successfully after launch.  HTV3 capture & berthing are scheduled for 7/27. At wakeup, Sergei Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-3 Acaba had Day 2 of his 2nd (FD30) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording his diet input today, Joe will begin the urine collections for pH value on Monday (7/23) and blood sampling on Tuesday (7/24).      [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15th day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 & 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.] Later in the day, FE-6 Hoshide unstowed the Pro K pH kit and prepositioned it with controlled diet menu items and daily consumables in preparation for his upcoming first (FD15) Pro K Controlled Diet activity, starting tomorrow with the first pH test and diet log entry. Padalka, Revin, Acaba, Malenchenko, Williams & Hoshide joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Sergei & Gennady also completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), and the grilles of the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System and SKV air conditioner in the SM. In COL, for her on-going first Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular), FE-5 Williams reached midpoint at about 7:30am EDT, after which she began the second 24h data collection period, with Makita batteries swapped and recharged during the day.       [For the second 24 hr period, the Cardiopres was temporarily doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery were changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).  (ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.)] The CDR performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Joe Acaba conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. At ~9:00am EDT, the entire crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~11:10am, Aki Hoshide had his daily post-launch PMC (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video. FE-3 & FE-5 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Joe at ~12:15pm, Suni at ~3:40pm, EDT. Williams & Hoshide brushed up on their ARED exercise proficiency by watching Joe Acaba use the machine, and Aki also observed Joe working out on the CEVIS cycle. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4).  UPA Failure:   The UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) failed last night, requiring the ground to switch the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) from UPA to storage in the internal EDV container.  While engineers are discussing a forward plan, the internal EDV is expected to have sufficient capacity until tomorrow before it is filled. Tasks listed for Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,EKON Earth photography of the current flooding conditions in Russia’s Kuban region, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-Two – Week 3). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD Shielding (NASA/ASI):     On GMT160, André successfully relocated the ALTEA instrument from Destiny to Columbus. He reconfigured the instrument in the so-called “shielding” configuration. The first measurement session was started right away, aiming at characterizing dedicated shielding tiles. On GMT201, one of the Silicon Detector Units (SDU #1) went off. SDU#1 is required for scientific data acquisition and, at the time of this reporting, the recovery of the unit is being worked. To date, 40 cumulative days of measurements have been performed. Session#1 must be pursued for a minimum of 40-60 cumulative days, hence the minimum required duration on the first location has been met.       [Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):    The Amine Swingbed team is continuing the fault tree analysis, and the leading indicator to the anomaly experienced on in June is that the design of our control circuit is not providing sufficient power to the Swingbed valve motor.  This, combined with the motor speed limitations programmed into the software/firmware, is not allowing the motor to provide enough torque to overcome resistive forces within the valve.  Position sensor misalignment cannot be ruled out without on orbit troubleshooting.

Asian Seed 2010 (JAXA):    Returned on ULF6. BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      This week we performed six tests.  In the first test, we tested if a burning flat fabric sample could be blown out just using a high air flow.   In the second test, we reversed the flame direction and repeated the test.   In both tests, the flame was able to survive the high flow rate and consumed the entire sample.  The third and fourth tests studied the flammability limits of two different kinds of nomex that are not flammable on earth in air.  One sample, at low flow, ignited briefly but extinguished, and the other one, at high flow, did not ignite.   Since this sample ignited and burned at a lower flow rate, we attribute this to the cooling effect of the flow.   A fifth ultem film sample was also tested for flammability, and ignited but self-extinguished before any significant flame spread occurred.  Notice the difference in the flow effects for samples that are burning versus samples that are igniting.  If a flame is present, this range of flows enhances the heat transfer and helps sustain the flame.  However, for samples trying to ignite, the flow acts to cool the sample, making it harder for the sample to ignite.   Lastly, a previously-burned acrylic sphere was tested in the wake configuration.  The igniter broke before ignition was achieved.    We have 3 of 9 igniters remaining, but we are making some contingency plans including using SPICE igniters and modifying spent igniters from the used flat sample tests. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
