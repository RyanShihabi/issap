ISS On-Orbit Status 04/25/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking & brushing teeth, CDR Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit continued their first liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 3), followed by dry saliva sample collections throughout the day and taking documentary photography.  The collections are made every other day for six days.        [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] FE-4 Kononenko terminated his 5th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  FE-2 Ivanishin collected the regular air samples for return on 28S, using a Russian AK-1M absorber in the SM for air, plus IPD-CO Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (Carbon Monoxide) and subsequently also for NH3 (Ammonia). Dan Burbank supported the JAXA 2DNT (2D Nano Template) Experiment-2 by retrieving the 2D Nano Template Kit2 with its bags from MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) at +2 degC for return.      [Objective of 2DNT is to produce high-quality “2D nano peptide arrays” under microgravity, and to manufacture substrates for electronic devices on the ground by using the template.  Background:  Peptides are arranged on the base plate slowly.  Microgravity means no convection, which makes for an ordered array.  Only small peptides are used for growth (the membrane shuts out big grains which would cause disordered array).] Later, Dan serviced the VIABLE experiment (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS), touching and blowing the top of each of 4 VIABLE bags in the FGB (loc. 409) where they are stowed to collect environment samples.      [This investigation evaluates microbial biofilm development on space materials.  Objectives are to determine the microbial strain producing the anti-biofilm product, evaluate the chemical nature of the anti-biofilm product, study the innovative materials which are chemo-physically treated, and address the biological safety issues associated with microbial biofilms.  Background: Most surfaces are covered with microorganisms under natural conditions.  The process by which a complex community of microorganisms is established on a surface is known as biofilm formation.  Microbial biofilms can exist in many different forms by a wide range of microorganisms.  The process of biofilm formation is a prerequisite for substantial corrosion and/or deterioration of the underlying materials to take place.  VIABLE samples are composed by both metallic and textile space materials either conventional or innovative (Aluminum, Armaflex and Betacloth).  They are placed inside four foam lined Nomex bags, specifically:  Pouch 1 - untreated space materials; Pouch 2 - space materials pre-treated with biosurfactants; Pouch 3 - space materials pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide; Pouch 4 - space materials chemo-physically pre-treated with silica and silver coating.] Assisted by Kononenko, Shkaplerov conducted the MO-22 Sanitary-Epidemiological Status check, part of the Russian MedOps program done on structures and crewmembers usually before Soyuz departures.       [To monitor for microflora, Anton collected samples from surface areas of interior panels and hardware at numerous locations in the SM, FGB, MRM1, MRM2 and DC1, also from himself, FE-2 Ivanishin & FE-4 Kononenko using cotton swabs and special test tubes which were then stowed in 28S for return to the ground.] In preparation for their return to gravity early Friday morning (4:19am EDT), Anton Shkaplerov & Anatoly Ivanishin undertook Part 2 of their 5th and final exercise/training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the TVIS treadmill, assisted by Oleg Kononenko as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Medical telemetry monitoring on the ground was at 6:05am for FE-2, 7:41am EDT for FE-1.  The activity was then closed out.       [The assessments, lasting one hour each, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground sites, uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -30, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each, then -25, -30, and -40 mmHg (Torr) for 10 min. each plus -30mmHg for 5 min. while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] In preparation for today’s ISS/ATV reboost, André closed the protective shutters of the USOS (Lab, Node-3/Cupola, Kibo module) windows. Kuipers & Pettit each completed the (approx.) monthly O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, their 5th, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.        [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There has been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.] Later, Don printed out new SODF (Station Operation Data File) cue card updates.In the Lab, André Kuipers accessed the NanoRacks Modules and collected data for subsequent transfer to the ER-1 (EXPRESS Rack 1) laptop. Shkaplerov had ~3 hrs set aside for packing & loading return cargo on Soyuz 28S. Ivanishin took documentary photography of the transfer & stowage of the BTKh-44 Kaltsiy (Calcium) biotechnology payload on the Soyuz descent capsule. Ivanishin also removed the ID-3MKS dosimeter assemblies of the RBO-3-4 Matryoshka-R radiation payload from the RL protective covers of the right (#2) Kabin (Crew Quarters) for return to Earth Before sleeptime, FE-2 will close out operations in the BIO-1 POLYGENE payload and transfer it to 28S. For the Exp-30 undocking, Anatoly set up the Motorola Iridium-9505A satellite phone of the Soyuz TMA-22M/28S for recharging.  Later, FE-2 terminated the process, stowed the phone in the 28S Descent Module and closed out.   (Done last time: 1/12).          [After retrieving the phone from its location in the spacecraft Descent Module (SA, spuskayemyy apparat), the crewmember initiated the recharge of the lithium-ion battery, monitoring the process every 10-15 minutes as it took place.  Upon completion, the phone was returned inside their SSSP Iridium kits and stowed back in the SA’s ODF (operational data files) container.  The satphone accompanies returning ISS crews on Soyuz reentry & landing for contingency communications with SAR (Search-and-Rescue) personnel after touchdown (e.g., after an “undershoot” ballistic reentry, as happened during the 15S return).  The Russian-developed procedure for the monthly recharging has been approved jointly by safety officials.  During the procedure, the phone is left in its fire-protective fluoroplastic bag with open flap.  The Iridium 9505A satphone uses the Iridium constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to relay the landed Soyuz capsule's GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates to helicopter-borne recovery crews.  The older Iridium-9505 phones were first put on board Soyuz in August 2003.  The newer 9505A phone, currently in use, delivers 30 hours of standby time and three hours of talk, up from 20 and two hours, respectively, on the older units.] Performing standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in the MRM1 Rassvet, Anatoly downloaded the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the Progress docking to a laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] Anton took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Before exercising on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), Don Pettit serviced the workout machine, performing periodic maintenance by evacuating its cylinder flywheels to reestablish proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration. After tagging up with ground specialists to discuss upcoming SpaceX Dragon cargo transfer operations at ~4:35am EDT, Dan, Don & André spent several hours retrieving & pre-packing equipment to be loaded on the Dragon capsule for return. Dan also conducted maintenance on the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment), removing & replacing its expired ACTEX (Activated Carbon/Ion Exchange) filter cartridge in the WHC flush water jumper at the Node-3 F4 rack UIP (Utility Interface Panel).    [Deferred yesterday.] FE-6 performed regular maintenance on the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment), changing out its UR (Urine Receptacle) hose and IF (Insert Filter), then vacuumed the entire WHC and cleaned it with disinfectant wipes.  (Deferred yesterday).     [The old UR & IF were double-bagged and stowed for disposal.] After yesterday’s major modification work on his Kazbek-UM couch seat liner, Ivanishin today performed a fit check on the new liner, donning his Sokol KV-2 space suit, positioning himself in the Kazbek seat in the Soyuz 28S SA Descent Capsule, tightening the restraint system and assessing the fit, using a ruler to measure clearances. Kononenko took documentary video/photography of Anatoly’s Kazbek fit check activities. Oleg also removed the Pille-ISS duty radiation dosimeter in the SM, deactivated the reader, removed the memory card with the accumulated data and stowed it for return on Soyuz 28S. Don Pettit had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] At ~1:35pm EDT, Kononenko, Pettit & Kuipers teamed up for the standard one-hour Crew Emergency Roles & Responsibilities Review (peredacha smeniy po bezopasnosti), to familiarize themselves with their new emergency roles & responsibilities as Expedition 31 three-person crew during, including escape routes.       [Baseline emergency response actions are covered in the EMER-1 book.  Emergencies may arise due to ammonia (NH3) leak, non-ammonia toxic spills, fire or rapid depressurization, and one or more members of the 29S crew could become incapacitated during such an emergency response.] At ~10:10am, Burbank, Kuipers & Pettit supported an Educational PAO TV downlink, chatting with grade 6-7 students and educators at “Destination Station” at Research Triangle Park Neal Middle School, Durham, North Carolina. At ~3:00pm, all six crewmembers will join up for the traditional “Change of Command” ceremony, officially marking the transfer of the baton from Increment 30 to Increment 31, with Oleg Kononenko taking over Command from Dan Burbank who temporarily will become FE-3. At ~3:20pm, the crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H. CDR & FE-6 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Don at ~11:30am, Dan at ~1:20pm EDT. Before Presleep, Pettit will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime Before sleeptime, FE-6 will configure onboard C&T (Communications & Tracking) for his Node-2 CQ (Crew Quarters) as the new “On-Call” crewmember by connecting the Node-2 port-side ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) #15 and verifying speaker functionality. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  CDR Burbank performed a session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video was to be downlinked by Dan via MPC.      [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] After Dan’s T2 session, Anton Shkaplerov closed down the T2 software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display.     [After the display shutdown, the T2 rack is power cycled (turned off/on) from the ground, and T2 is then ready for use.  These power cycles allow for the T2 data to be transferred to the Server for downlink.]  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the South shores of Lake Baikal, Krasnaya Polyana, Terek River delta, the Volga, the Caspian Sea, Kolka glacier, volcanoes Hudson Mount Etna, Arenal, Stromboli, Huascaran, Arenal, Poas & Popocatepetl, glacier Allalin, and Darwin Island,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).ISS/ATV Reboost:  Today at 8:13am EDT, a one-burn ISS reboost with ATV-3 “Edoardo Amaldi” OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters was conducted for a duration of 16min 8sec and a delta-V of 2.3 m/s, resulting in a predicted mean altitude increase of 4.1 km.   Purpose of the reboost was to set up phasing for Soyuz 30S launch. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Bigach Impact Crater, Kazakhstan (ISS had a fair weather pass over this target as it approached from the SW.  The crew had a nadir-view over this feature.  This 8-km in diameter impact is a roughly circular structure and somewhat subtle to recognize.  At this time, just after crossing Lake Balkhash, the crew was to begin looking for Bigach.  Overlapping mapping frames, taken along track, were suggested in order to obtain imagery of the challenging crater), Volga - Ural Delta (the water level of the Caspian Sea, the world’s largest lake, is variable due to its land-locked condition and climate induced changes in the discharge of its major rivers.  This causes significant changes in the coastal wetlands in the north and northwest parts of the sea.  ISS had a fair weather pass for this target today.  At this time as ISS tracked northeastward over the open waters of the Caspian the crew was to look left of track and try for an overlapping mapping strip of the wetland areas), Conakry, Guinea (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  ISS had a fair weather pass with its approach from the SW for this target area.  Conakry is also a port and largest city of Guinea.  At this time as ISS approached the African coast, the crew was to look just right of track for this urban area located on the Kaluoum Peninsula with the Loos Islands just off shore), Bay of Callao, Lima, Peru (HMS BEAGLE SITE:  Darwin and the Beagle arrived at this port city, just west of Lima on July 19, 1835 to take on provisions.  The city is built on and about a small peninsula, La Punta, and just opposite the offshore island of San Lorenzo.  At this time, as ISS tracked northeastward, towards the coast of South America in fair weather, the crew was to look near nadir for this target), Bridgetown, Barbados (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:   Bridgetown is the capital and largest city of the island country of Barbados with the population of the metropolitan area at 96,578 [2006].  As ISS approached the island from the SW in fair weather at this time, the crew was to look towards nadir for this target.  Barbados is the easternmost of the Lesser Antilles Archipelago.  The city is located on the southwestern coast of the island along Carlisle Bay), and San Jose, Costa Rica (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  ISS had a fair weather pass today for this target with approach from the SW.  San Jose is the largest city in Costa Rica, with a population near 400,000.  It is located in the mountainous interior of the country.  At this time, as the crew approached the coast of Central America, the crew was to begin looking near nadir for this urban area and try to capture it all within a single frame).
