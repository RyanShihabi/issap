ISS On-Orbit Status 11/28/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Underway: Week 2 of Increment 30 (three-person crew). Today 47 years ago (1964), NASA launched Mariner 4 which accomplished the first successful flyby of Mars and returned the first close-up photographs of its surface (which changed the common view about life on Mars). After wakeup, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-2 Ivanishin conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. Next, FE-1 & FE-2 conducted the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Anton & Anatoly were joined by CDR Dan Burbank in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device set up (and later cleaned up and stowed away) by Shkaplerov.       [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ] Later, Shkaplerov started his first session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2-1 protocol which monitors human cardiovascular performance in the space flight environment.       [After 24 hrs of ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed (CDM) system, Anton will doff the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads and recorded on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results will then be downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data will be downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] CDR Burbank uninstalled & removed the three alignment guides from CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) at Lab bay S3, engaged the snubber pins and locked the safety pins to allow the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be active before begin of ground-commanded CIR operations requiring a microgravity environment. Afterwards, Dan performed regular maintenance calibration on the sensors of the two CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1043 & #1048.Anatoly Ivanishin conducted the regular monthly/quarterly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation & Stabilization).          [Required was an inspection of the condition of harnesses, belt slats, corner bracket ropes, SLD (Subject Load Device) cables & exit pulley housing, IRBAs (Isolation Restorative Bungee Assemblies) and gyroscope wire ropes for any damage or defects, lubricating as required plus recording control panel time & date values, and making sure that the display cable and skirt were properly secured afterwards.] Later, FE-2 completed the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO2 (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit.       [The AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO2 during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP).] CDR Burbank underwent his first session with the U.S. PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol as subject, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on BP (blood pressure) & ECG (electrocardiogram) during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with BP/ECG equipment and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.  FE-1 Shkaplerov assisted as Operator/CMO.  The BP/ECG recordings were later transferred from the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) via USB thumb drive to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for downlink to the ground.        [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.]  In the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment), Dan removed the air filter and replaced it with a fresh one. Anton had ~2 hrs allotted for more unloading of Progress 45P and transferring cargo to the ISS for stowage, guided by an uplinked loading plan.      [Of the approximately 1166 listed entries on 45P, about 404 are USOS items.  Progress M-13M is to remain docked at the DC1 for about 3 months, and its unloading continues as a long-term activity.]  Meanwhile, Anatoly had another 1h 15m for IMS (Inventory Management System)-logged cargo transfers from Soyuz 28S (#232), guided by an uplinked Cargo Loading manifest listing 147 items.  These transfers are being spread over the long-term, to maximize making use of Soyuz stowage room over time. In the US A/L (Airlock), the CDR inspected a PBA (Portable Breathing Apparatus, #1021) air bottle for which a low pressure reading was reported on 11/21.  Documentary photographs were taken and copied to SSC-8 (Station Support Computer 8) for downlink to the ground. In Node-3, Burbank protected the PBA O2 port (which had been found by the crew on 11/21 to be without a cap) with a Teflon bag and vinyl tape. In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Dan prepared MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) units for upcoming preservative storage needs, first retrieving 11 white (+4 degC) Ice Bricks from MELFI-3 Dewar 3 trays/sections and inserting them in Dewar 4  (thus making Dewar 3 available to support a colder temperature).  An additional 5 Ice Bricks, from stowage, were also inserted in Dewar 4.   Next, Dan retrieved 16 green (-32 degC) Ice Bricks from MELFI-3 for insertion into Dewar 3. Afterwards, the CDR went on a search for 3 missing CIR Manifold Bottles needed for upcoming operations and located them in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), one (#2015) in loc. O2_C2, the other two (#2022, #2023) in loc. O2_G. The two Russian FEs started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, with Anton removing & replacing the four dust filter cartridges (PF1-4) in the SM and Anatoly working in the FGB to swap its two dust filters (PS1-2) with new spares, discarding the used cartridges and updating the IMS. Working in the SM, Ivanishin removed the POTOK-150МК (150 micron) Air Purification Unit of the SOGS Air Revitalization Subsystem and replaced it with a new unit. Burbank pre-gathered required hardware items of the CUCU (COTS UHF Communications Unit) and restowed it in Node-2 for the upcoming (11/30) Combined Demo software update and checkout, which will involve the CUCU software and SpaceX “Dragon” CCP (Crew Command Panel) firmware, followed by a checkout of the changes.       [For the new Dragon Combined Demo (Demo 2 & 3 being merged), “Commanding from ISS” via the CCP will be demonstrated while the spacecraft flies 2.5 km under the ISS.] Ivanishin conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anatoly also took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Shkaplerov set up & readied the equipment for his first session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), to be conducted tomorrow right after wake-up.       [MO-10 measures the red cell count of the blood.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.] The three crewmembers had about an hour of free time each for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. Early in the morning, the CDR set up the G1 video camera in Node-3 to cover the workout sessions of himself, Anatoly & Anton on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), to meet the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status. Burbank performed his first session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] Before Presleep, Burbank will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR). The Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list for Shkaplerov & Ivanishin today suggested more preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were.
