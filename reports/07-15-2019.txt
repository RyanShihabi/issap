Muscle Tone in Space (Myotones): The crew gathered hardware for tomorrow’s scheduled Myotones operations. The investigation observes the biochemical properties of muscles during long-term exposure to the spaceflight environment. Results from this investigation are expected to provide insight into principles of human resting muscle tone which could lead to the development of new strategies for alternative treatments for rehabilitation both on Earth and for future space missions.
EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments for Space Station Racks (EXPRESS Rack) 9B: During the SpX-17 mission, Columbus Power and Data Unit (PDU) 1 Outlet 7 which provides auxiliary power to the rack, tripped and could not be closed. Troubleshooting was unsuccessful and it was determined that the Biological Research Program Solid State Power Control Module (BSSPCM) needed to be replaced. Today the crew replaced the BSSPCM Sold State Power Converter Module to recover auxiliary power. The EXPRESS Racks support science experiments in any discipline by providing structural interfaces, power, data, cooling, water, and other items needed to operate science experiments in space. 
Robotics Onboard Trainer (ROBoT) Dragon On-Board Training (OBT): In preparation for SpX-18 arrival, the crew practiced a 30 meter approach, two Capture Point hold runs and numerous two meter runs. Later in the day the crew studied the OBT big picture and reference summary. SpX-18 is scheduled to launch on July 21 and berth on July 23.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Yesterday, Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS and performed a survey of the future International Docking Assembly (IDA3) EVA worksite. The SSRMS was then maneuvered to the Offset Grapple Start position and is now in ready for crew offset grapple practice on Thursday in preparation for SpX-18 berthing.
