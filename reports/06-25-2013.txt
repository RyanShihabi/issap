USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA)-22 Preparations:  Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy, FE-5 Parmitano, FE-6 Nyberg and CDR Vinogradov reviewed procedures for US EVA #22 scheduled for July 9th and US EVA #23 scheduled for July 16th. The review included detailed timelines and a briefing package. Following this activity they participated in a conference with ground teams. The crew also performed a Portable Onboard Computers (POC) Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software review.
Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)-4 Hatch Open and Cargo Operations:  CDR Vinogradov performed a leak check, then he and FE-5 Parmitano re-opened the ATV hatch and re-connected the quick disconnect screw clamps. The hatch was closed on Sunday, June 23rd for Russian EVA #33. Following the hatch opening, Cassidy, Nyberg, and Parmitano completed this week’s ATV4 cargo operations completing 7 hours and 15 minutes of cargo operations in six crew hours and are approximately 51% complete with cargo operations.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) and maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to grapple the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator System (SPDM). They will next release the SPDM from Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF) 2 and maneuver SPDM Arm 2 to pick up the Robot Micro Conical Tool (RMCT) 2 from the SPDM Tool Holder Assembly (THA) with On-Orbit Replaceable Unit (ORU) Tool Changeout Mechanism (OTCM)-2. Finally the Robotics Ground Controllers will maneuver the SSRMS and SPDM into position for the start of the Secondary Power Distribution Assembly (SPDA) Door Checkout operations tomorrow.
