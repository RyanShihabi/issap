ISS On-Orbit Status 12/25/10 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Crew rest day. Merry Christmas!  FE-4 Dmitri Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dima will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] FE-1 Alex Kaleri completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] With POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center/Huntsville) closed down over the holiday, CDR Scott Kelly is charged with verifying the health of MELFI -1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) and MELFI-3 by checking dewar temperatures on their PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop displays.     [MELFI-1 dewars 1, 2, 3, 4 should show -95 degC, -95 degC, -95 degC, +2 degC; MELFI-3 dewars 1,2,3,4 -95 degC, -95 degC, +2 degC, +2 degC.] The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]  CDR, FE-5 & FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Paolo at ~4:50am, Scott at ~9:30am, Cady at ~11:05am EST. OGS Up and running:   Flight controllers successfully activated the Oxygen Generator System yesterday, for the crew’s “breathing pleasure”.  It is planned to run it for approximately 2 days to increase the cabin oxygen content and then deactivate it nominally.

We are now really looking forward to the images from sample 3.  Needless to say, the excitement we're seeing for samples 2 and 3 is shared by the other BCAT-5 scientists who have the other BCAT-5 samples you'll be running.  They have different science and interesting questions to address in microgravity and we're looking forward to working with you on these in the coming weeks.” BIOLAB (ESA):    No report.
