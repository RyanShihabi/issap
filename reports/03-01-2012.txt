03-01-2012March 01, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 03/01/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Also during the morning inspection, Anton conducted the periodic checkup of the circuit breakers & fuses in the DC1 Pirs module.      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 & MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 & BPP-36.  MRM2 & MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.] After wakeup, CDR Burbank & FE-5 Kuipers each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 32nd for Dan, the 26th for André.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] In the JAXA Kibo laboratory, FE-6 Pettit serviced the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 5 (homogenized on 2/27) once every two hours for seven days.  Crew performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike Fossum’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.] Ivanishin completed his 5th session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.    [A crewmember stood by to assist Anatoly in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Don Pettit powered up MSPR (Multipurpose Small Payload Rack) components and then performed a checkout of the IEEE1394 and video communication connections of the CC (Combustion Chamber).  Afterwards, MSPR was powered off.     [IEEE1394 is a very fast external comm bus standard that supports data transfer rates of up to 400 Mbps (in 1394a) and 800 Mbps (in 1394b).  The technology was originally developed by Apple under the name Firewire.] With the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) activated and the G1 camcorder set up in the Lab for real-time ground monitoring, Pettit configured the SLICE (Structure & Liftoff In Combustion Experiment) pyrometry hardware and performed the 5th flame test operation, today lifting tests with 40% methane and without the BG7 dimming filter (since these flames are very dim).  Later, FE-6 installed another burner tube in the SPICE Experiment Assembly, replaced the flash/memory card with a new one and ran the flame test a second time.  MSG was then deactivated.       [The research goal is to gain unique data to extend scientists’ predictive capability.  Earth application: Increased efficiency and reduced pollutant emission for practical combustion devices, improved numerical modeling, hence improved design tools, hence improved practical combustion on Earth (currently, the good modeling-experiment agreement breaks down when flames are lean or heavily sooting).  Measurements: still images (with camera that was blackbody calibrated for pyrometry), video & radiometer.  Hardware:  SLICE is conducted in the MSG using the SPICE hardware.] With FE-1 Shkaplerov assisting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer), FE-4 Kononenko performed the Russian biomed assessment MO-14 (Assessment of Orthostatic Endurance during LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) which examines the orthostatic stability of the crewmember’s cardiovascular system at rest using complex methods.  The session was monitored from the ground during a RGS (Russian Ground Station) window at ~5:03am EST.     [Equipment used includes the Chibis-M ODNT device, CDM/Kardiomed unit, Doppler unit, CDP/Kardiopres with pump, belt & control units, cuffs, etc.] In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), CDR Burbank unstowed and set up the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware with power, data, front panel, and gas connections, including MBS (Mixing Bag System) for his next session with VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions), scheduled tomorrow.       [The VO2max assessment uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.] Anatoly continued his major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of removing old SMOK condensate lines (smennykh magistralej otkaachki kondensata) of the SOTR Thermal Control System in the SM and replacing them with new spares (last time done: August 2010).      [FE-2 today replaced SMOK sections from the KR1 control valve (pressure regulator) to the SK1 valve assembly and then from SK1 to the VU trap insert of the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor of the Russian Water Recovery System, supported by ground specialist tagup. The IFM will be concluded on 3/3.] André Kuipers performed the periodic module hatch seal inspection in all USOS (US Segment) modules, for which he had ~3hrs 5min.    [FE-5 checked the hatches at JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment) Deck, JPM Ovhd & Stbd, COL Port, Node-2 Port, Stbd & Aft, Lab Fwd & Aft, A/L (Airlock) Stbd & Port, Node-1 Fwd, Stbd, Deck, Aft & Port, and Node-3 Stbd & Deck.] Afterwards, André conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.     [The new card (29-0008L) lists 23 CWCs (368.4 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (4 CWCs with 129.8 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria, plus 1 empty bag;  2. Condensate water (2 CWCs with 9.8 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (7 CWCs with 97.9 L; also 6 expired bags with 104.3 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 6.4 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Shkaplerov performed the (currently daily) inspection of the KOB-2 cooling loop #2 of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System in the SM, checking a liquid connector on the 4SPN2 panel for coolant leaks.     [In case there were any large droplets (10-20 cm3), the crew was to report to TsUP-Moscow.] In the JAXA Kibo laboratory, Dan Burbank conducted another session with the CFE-2 VG2 (Capillary Flow Experiments 2 / Vane Gap 2) experiment, first preparing the MWA WSA (Maintenance Work Area \ Work Surface Area) and then running the 2-hr test with the VG2 “B” vessel.  Afterwards, the equipment was torn down and stowed away.         [CFE has applications to the management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.  To predict the behavior of liquids in microgravity, one tool scientists use is an open-source computer program called SE-FIT (Surface Evolver Fluid Interface Tool), which is an accurate predictor of the liquid-surface shape in space.  For the CFE experiment, engineers are using SE-FIT to predict the behavior of liquids with varying test container shapes. The program's predicted liquid-gas behavior has explained extremely small changes or even imperfections in container shape during the on-orbit study that led to large changes in liquid behavior.  By using these predictions, engineers can design tanks & equipment to keep the fluids flowing with the correct distribution of liquids & gases in microgravity.  This also means that under certain conditions pumps and other mechanical equipment, such as centrifuges or thruster firings, will not be necessary to move liquids through the plumbing structure of space vehicles.  VG1 is one of three CFE experiments, the others being ICF (Interior Corner Flow) and CL (Contact Line).  Each of the CFE experiments is represented with two unique experimental units (1,2), all of which use similar fluid-injection hardware, have simple and similarly sized test chambers, and rely solely on video for highly quantitative data.  Silicone oil is the fluid used for all the tests, with different viscosities depending on the unit.  Differences between units are primarily fluid properties, wetting conditions, and test cell cross section.]   Ivanishin performed a 30-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. Kuipers undertook the periodic manual transfer of urine from an EDV-U container (#974) to the UPA WSTA (Urine Processor Assembly / Waste Storage Tank Assembly) for UPA processing.       [During such transfers, the crewmember always wears protective safety goggles, dust mask and nitrile gloves.] Later, André performed regular maintenance on the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment), changing out its UR (Urine Receptacle) hose and IF (Insert Filter), then vacuumed the entire WHC and cleaned it with disinfectant wipes.     [The old UR & IF were double-bagged and stowed for disposal.] Oleg conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anton meanwhile took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), Don unstowed a spare RIC (Rack Interface Controller) in JPM and set it aside for tomorrow’s scheduled replacement of the ER4 (EXPRESS Rack 4) RIC. Anatoly executed the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA. Before Presleep, Burbank will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Before sleeptime, Kononenko will set up the battery of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment for overnight charging.      [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).     [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for CEVIS.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Before exercising on the ARED, the crew set up the G1 video camera in Node-3 to cover the workout sessions of Anton & Anatoly on the machine, to meet the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.  Afterwards, the video footage transferred to VTR (Video Tape Recorder) for ground downlink. At ~4:30am, André performed the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with COL-CC (Control Center) at Oberpfaffenhofen/Germany.     [This conference is scheduled once every week, between ISS crewmembers and Col-CC via S/G2 (Space-to-Ground 2) audio.] Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on Aral Sea, Lake Baikal, the Laganakskoe plateau, Krasnaya Polyana, the Volga River Delta, Volcano Cordon-Kaul, Allalin Glacier, Lipetsk and Auckland,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). MT Translation:    Tonight during the 2-hr period of 6:40pm-8:40pm EST, the Mobile Transporter with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) will be moved from WS5 (Worksite 5) to WS2 by Robotics ground control in preparation for next week’s ground-controlled RRM (Robotics Refueling Mission).  For the translation, Russian thrusters will be temporarily disabled from 6:40pm-8:40pm for load relief. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Dakar, Senegal (the capital city of Senegal has a population estimated at just over 1 million and dominates the promontory known as Cape Verde, Africa's westernmost point.  ISS had a morning pass in fair weather for this target as it approached from the SW over the Cape Verde Islands.  Trying for a complete mapping of the urban area of the city), Rome, Italy ("The Eternal City" and capital of Italy [population ~2.7 million] lies just inland from sea on the western coastline of the Italian peninsula.  As ISS tracked NE on this early afternoon pass over the Italian peninsula, the crew was to look nadir for a context view of the Rome metropolitan), San Salvador, El Salvador (ISS had a mid-morning pass over the capital city of El Salvador with a fair-weather approach from the SW.  The sprawling urban area of the city of over 2 million lies in an interior mountain valley surrounded by volcanoes and is prone to earthquakes.  As ISS crossed the Pacific coast, the crew was to look for this city just west of Lake Ilopango), and Nassau, Bahamas (ISS had an early afternoon pass over Nassau, capital city of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.  Some scattered clouds may have been present.  The city of Nassau proper is located on the eastern half of New Providence Island; however, the metropolitan area encompasses the entire island. Overlapping mapping frames of the island, concentrating on the eastern half, were requested).
