ISS Reboost: Overnight a planned reboost using the 58P 8R&D thrusters was performed.  This reboost is the second of two to set up 4-orbit rendezvous for 43S launch scheduled for July 22.  The reboost is also the first of three scheduled to set up 4-orbit rendezvous conditions for 44S launch and 42S landing in the primary landing zone in September, 2015.  The next ISS reboosts are scheduled for August 7 and August 24.
NanoRack Cubesat Deployer (NRCSD) Preparations:  Today Kelly continued preparations begun yesterday for a series of deployments of CubeSats from a NRCSD.  The deployments will be made via the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS), beginning on Monday, July 13.  Kelly completed the cable configuration and installation of Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) to the deployers.  Initially there were some difficulties with the MLI coverage of the deployers due to a new deployer cable configuration.  The problem was resolved with the use of an additional piece of MLI secured with existing velcro attachments.  The slide table was then retracted into the JEM Airlock (AL).  Depressurization will be completed tomorrow.  Once depressurization is complete Kelly will perform a leak check and vent residual air. A total of 16 cubesats will be deployed next week:  14 Planet Lab Doves, 1 Arkyd 3 and 1 Centennial-1.
