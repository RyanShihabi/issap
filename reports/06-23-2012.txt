ISS On-Orbit Status 06/23/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off duty. After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Joe Acaba, André Kuipers & Don Pettit completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 10th for Joe, the 50th for Don & André.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] FE-5 conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Kuipers also had Day 1 of the pH test and diet log entry for the Pro K pH plus controlled diet menu protocol of his 5th (FD180) Pro K Controlled Diet activity with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  André will start the urine collections for pH value on Monday (6/25) and blood sampling on Tuesday (6/26).       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] The six Exp-31 crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg, Sergei & Gennady completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP). The CDR handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sergei Revin worked on the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, mixing a new sample in the KT thermal enclosure in the GB/Glavboks-S (Glovebox-S) and transferred it to the TBU-V incubator (+29 degC), as  Gennady Padalka took documentary photography. At ~10:30am EDT, Joe Acaba activated the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) routing to downlink the recording of his Treadmill Kinematics session of yesterday, stopping it at ~3:25pm. Pettit & Acaba out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Joe’s 5th, Don’s 18th.      [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Padalka completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~5:15pm EDT.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 6/2 & 6/3).] FE-6 Pettit broke out and set up the hardware for the INTEGRATED IMMUNE saliva samplings, to be collected of André & himself every other day for six days, scheduled to start tomorrow.        [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] CDR & FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~6:30am, Don at ~2:40pm EDT. At ~12:55pm, Joe Acaba powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 1:05pm conducted a ham radio session with Scouts Canada, Nova Scotia Council, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada.     [Involved were youth from Cubs, Scouts, and Ventures (Ages 8-15).  In addition this event was held in conjunction with Scout groups earning their Science Badge Awards.  Participants have been selected through application from various Nova Scotia Scouting Council members across central Nova Scotia.] At ~2:05pm, the three Russian crewmembers conducted an amateur/ham radio exchange with participants of the Slavic Fellowship International Forum-2012 (Slavyanskoye Sodruzhestvo-2012), with students from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine participating.     [Questions from the ground:  ”Would you want your children to become cosmonauts?”; “What did you dream to see in space and did your dream come true?”; “What is the hardest work at ISS?”; “Are dreams in space different from those on the ground?”; “A mundane question about UFOs – do they bother you?”; “What did you find unexpected and fascinating once you found yourselves in space?”] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR/2x, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-2).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic/continuous), with CEVIS (aerobic/interval), ARED+T2 (Kinematics), T2 (aerobic/interval), ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic/continuous) and CEVIS (aerobic/interval) following in the next 5 days.]  Tasks listed for Kononenko, Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic coast of Africa and the South-East Pacific coast of South America, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,·        Recording high-resolution video with the SONY HVR-Z7E to be used in a joint project of Roskosmos TV Studio with Karusel (Carousel) TV Channel for children ages 8 to 12 years, the “It’s Time to go to space!” program, which has a segment where Russian cosmonauts are discussing their work &, answer viewers’ questions; the footage was then to be downlinked to TsUP-Moscow,·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). CDRA Update:   Yesterday, ground teams re-activated the Lab CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) with a new PPL (pre-positioned load) software patch which allows CDRA to operate without temperature feedback from the absorbent bed.  Lab CDRA is now working nominally.  The Node-3 CDRA was then deactivated (it provides the CO2 used by the Sabatier reactor which was therefore shut down beforehand). Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-One – Week 7). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD Shielding (NASA/ASI):     The first measurement session has started right away after the setup of the instrument on 6/8.  The experiment is running smoothly and to date, 13 cumulative days of measurements have been performed. Session#1 must be pursued for minimum 40 cumulative days.      [Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):      The Bead Check was successfully completed on 6/15.  This was the validation that both the motor and fuse replacement activities were successful, as well as verification that the structural integrity of the Amine Swingbed is good (no beads found).  We would like to express our sincere thanks to both Joe and Don for their quick work resolving the anomaly when the Amine Swingbed valve would not activate one of the end-of-motion position sensors.  Don did an outstanding job installing the Amine Swingbed into the Double Locker on 6/20, especially given the need to handle multiple pieces of hardware and tools while trying to mate the critical vacuum sealing surfaces.  We appreciate the careful inspection of all of the internal parts and we enjoyed all of the photos.  The extra few tasks Don did at the end of 6/21 to secure the vacuum and outlet air hoses were critical to getting us up and running the final leak check in time to start the planned test cases on 6/23.  So far the leak check is going well. AMS-02 (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer):     AMS Payload and Laptop operations are nominal.  As of 6/13, the AMS POCC has received data for over 18 Billion particle events.  Certification is complete for the AMS Asia POCC, located in Taiwan, which will perform science instrument monitoring for one shift per day starting July 3, 2012.  The other two shifts of science instrument monitoring, as well as all three shifts of AMS payload command and data operations, will continue to be performed at the AMS POCC located at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. APEX (Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit) -Cambium:    No report. APEX-TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System):   No report. Asian Seed 2010 (JAXA):    Returned on ULF6. BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      This week we burned a new 2-cm diameter PMMA sphere in the wake configuration.  Four tests were planned, and all were successfully completed.  Joe Acaba was able to get the hardware set up well before our expected start time so operations proceeded rapidly and we finished a bit early.  For each test, ignition was achieved at an air flow speed of 5 cm/s.  For the first test, the air flow was held constant.  For tests two and three the air flow was changed to 3 and 10 cm/s respectively.  All three tests were allowed to burn for several minutes, allowing the flame to spread and cover the entire sphere before turning the flow off to extinguish it.  For the last test only, the air flow was set to 1.5 cm/s after ignition, and then nitrogen flow was turned on to maximum.  The nitrogen was unable to extinguish the flame.  Instead, the flame grew, although in a non-symmetric way because of the presence of the nitrogen jet.  After a few minutes, the nitrogen was turned off, and the flame began to spread to cover the sphere symmetrically before the flow was again turned off leading to extinguishment.  After these tests, Joe performed a fan calibration, which indicated nominal behavior of the air flow system.  We have received images from 6/14, during which Joe burned a 1-cm diameter PMMA sphere in the normal configuration.  In the BASS tests so far, the effect of air flow speed is very dramatic.  The small spheres have the added effect of solid phase temperature rise, which causes the fuel vaporization rate to go up and cause some unusual and energetic flame shapes. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
