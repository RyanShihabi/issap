Personal CO2 Monitor Sensor Calibration: Today the crew will perform a single point calibration of the Personal CO2 monitors using and iPad and readings from a Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA) sample port. The Personal CO2 Monitor demonstrates a system capable of unobtrusively collecting and downlinking individual crew members’ CO2 exposure for weeks to months. This investigation evaluates wear ability principles in microgravity and also demonstrates Modular Wearable Architecture Base Board, allowing rapid certification of future wearable devices. 
Rodent Research 6 (RR-6):  The crew will remove the mice and restock both of the rodent habitats with new food bars in addition to cleaning the lids and interiors cages of the habitats in support of the on-going RR-6 investigation The Rodent Research-6 (RR-6) mission uses mice flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) and maintained on Earth to test drug delivery systems for combatting muscular breakdown in space or during disuse conditions. RR-6 includes several groups of mice selectively treated with a placebo or implanted with a nanochannel drug delivery chip that administers compounds meant to maintain muscle in low gravity/disuse conditions.
Condensate Water Separator Assembly (CWSA) Desiccant Module (DM) Inspection/R&R:  This morning, the crew will inspect the CWSA DM and determine if the salt is saturated.  If so, the DM will be replaced. 
ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) Operations:  Today the crew is performing activities to deconfigure the airlock and Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs).  Yesterday’s EVA was deferred, but much of the preparation had already been completed already.  The activities today include EMU water loop scrubs and Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) battery R&Rs. 
Russian EVA support:  Today the USOS crew assisted with preparations for the Russian EVA planned for Friday.  They gathered USOS tools and inspected tethers and bags that will be used by the Russian crew.
