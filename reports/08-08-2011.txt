ISS On-Orbit Status 08/08/11    All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Underway: Week 21 of Increment 27/28.     As part of the regular daily Morning Inspection, FE-1 Samokutyayev checked out the SM (Service Module) PSS caution & warning panel.   As his first activity of the day, FE-5 Furukawa started the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, taking three dosimeters and deploying them for static measurements in the USOS (US Segment).   Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum undertook their 9th weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.       [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]    CDR Borisenko, FE-1 Samokutyayev & FE-4 Volkov conducted the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Andrey, Aleksandr & Sergei were joined by FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device set up (and later stowed away) by Volkov.      [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ]   After donning their Sokol flight suits, Borisenko, Samokutyayev & Garan, due to return on 9/8, conducted the periodic 30-min. fit check of their Kazbek couches, the three contoured shock absorbing seats in the Soyuz TMA-21/26S spacecraft’s SA Descent Module.      [For the fit check, crewmembers remove their flightsuit cabin apparel and don Sokol KV-2 suit & comm caps, get into in their seats and assess the degree of comfort and uniform body support provided by the seat liner.  Using a ruler, they then measure the gap between the top of the head and the top edge of the structure facing the head crown.  The results are reported to TsUP.  Kazbek-UM couches are designed to withstand g-loads during launch and orbital insertion as well as during reentry and brake-rocket-assisted landing.  Each seat has two positions: cocked (armed) and noncocked. In cocked position, they are raised to allow the shock absorbers to function during touchdown.  The fit check assures that the crewmembers, whose bodies gain in length during longer-term stay in zero-G, will still be adequately protected by the seat liners for their touchdown in Kazakhstan, either emergency or regular return.]   FE-5 performed another session of the psychological POMS (Profile of Mood States) experiment, completing his questionnaire for downlink to ground specialist.   Later, Satoshi tested the JAXA SSHDTV (Super Sensitive High-Definition Television) camera for night views, first transferring it from Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) to the Node-3 and installing it in the Cupola, then equipping it with its zoom lens, setting the automatic recorder clock & time code and starting the recording for about 5 minutes of night view video, focused on the Japanese islands.    Mike Fossum opened the protective window shutters of Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Mike will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]   In the Lab, FE-6 removed the 4 alignment guides from CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to allow the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be activated before begin of ground-commanded CIR operations requiring a microgravity environment.   Afterwards, Mike continued his work with the SHERE (Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment) payload for a new series of sample runs.      [Activity steps included activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) from its laptop (SSC-12) and powering up the hardware, unstowing an FM (Fluid Module) from the CGBA (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus) for the first experiment run, then stowing the FM and retrieving another FM from CGBA for the second run and subsequent stowage.  The experiment data were transferred to the MLC (MSG Laptop Computer) for downlink, and the MSG was powered down.  Background:  Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of an applied stress (“preshearing” = rotation) which might be, for example, a shear stress or extensional stress.  In practice, rheology is principally concerned with extending the "classical" disciplines of elasticity and (Newtonian) fluid mechanics to materials whose mechanical behavior cannot be described with the classical theories.  SHERE is designed to study the effect of preshear (rotation) on the transient evolution of the microstructure and viscoelastic tensile stresses for solutions with long chains of monodisperse dilute polymer molecules in the MSG.  Collectively referred to as “Boger fluids,” these polymer solutions have become a popular choice for rheological studies of non-Newtonian fluids and are the non-Newtonian fluid used in this experiment.  The SHERE hardware consists of the Rheometer, Camera Arm, Interface Box, Cabling, Keyboard, Tool Box, Fluid Modules, and Stowage Tray.]   FE-1 Samokutyayev completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]   Sasha also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).   After familiarizing himself with the procedures for the SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites) research program by reviewing reference files, FE-3 Garan conducted a teleconference with the PD (Payload Developer) at ~4:45am EDT to discuss procedures.  Garan then had several hours set aside to relocate a wireless SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop the Kibo JPM to run the SPHERES GUI (Graphic User Interface), configure the equipment, cameras & beacons in the JPM work areas for the experiment and conduct a test run featuring several objectives, from simulating satellite inspection maneuvers to testing Zero Robotics code for the upcoming student competition.  The SSC was then returned to the USOS.  This was the first SPHERES session this year.       [SPHERES was originally developed to demonstrate the basics of formation flight and autonomous docking, using beacons as reference for the satellites, to fly formation with or dock to the beacon.  A number of programs define various incremental tests including attitude control (performing a series of rotations), attitude-only tracking, attitude and range tracking, docking with handheld and mounted beacons, etc.  The payload consists of up to three self-contained 8-inch dia. free-floating satellites which perform the various algorithms (control sequences), commanded and observed by the crew members which provide feedback to shape algorithm development.  Each satellite has 12 thrusters and a tank with CO2 for propellant.  In addition, there are 5 beacons, one beacon tester and a seat track extender for Beacon 5.  The first tests, in May 2006, used only one satellite (plus two beacons – one mounted and one hand-held); a second satellite arrived on ULF1.1, the third on 12A.1.  Formation flight and autonomous docking are important enabling technologies for distributed architectures.  Per applicable Flight Rule, SPHERES operations have no CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) output constraints if the CDRA (CO2 Removal Assembly) is operating in dual-bed or single-bed mode.  The experiment run is time-critical since Ku-band is required for real-time video downlink.]   Later, Ron set up the equipment for his next 24-hour urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood & urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]   Early in the day, CDR Borisenko checked out proper communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, and then downloaded data accumulated from the GFI-7 Molniya-GAMMA experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28.       [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.]   Afterwards, Andrey started the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, planting the first seeds (wheat) in two root modules (KM23, KM24), then wetting the modules with a pump and starting the operation of the greenhouse, using the RSK2 T61p laptop, supported by ground specialist tagup.     [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]    Later, the CDR also performed periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), initializing & re-deploying new Bubble dosimeters detectors and verifying proper function of the setup with the LULIN-5 electronics box, supported by ground specialist tagup.     [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (A21-A28) were initialized in the Bubble dosimeter reader in the SM and positioned at new exposure locations.  The deployment locations of the detectors were photo-documented with the NIKON D2X camera and also reported with initialization data to TsUP via log sheet via OCA.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls], Andrey performed periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), initializing & re-deploying new Bubble dosimeters detectors and verifying proper function of the setup with the LULIN-5 electronics box, supported by ground specialist tagup.

The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls],   Activities completed by Satoshi Furukawa included –  A configuration inventory      of MELFI 1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) dewars, followed by      reporting the results, Replacing the HRF Rack 1      Lenovo A31p laptop with a T61p machine, after removing the A31p’s      hard drive for stowage, then decabling & stowing the A31p, Installing the Integrated      Load software on the new HRF1 laptop by loading a DVD, checking the hard      drive for fitness and beginning the HRF Load software installation;      afterwards, Satoshi configured the serial adapter, verified good comm with      the Actiwatch Reader and then stowed the latter, Installing the Japanese      Flag, JAXA Flag and “Good Design Award” label on the Port      endcone of Kibo JPM, Reviewing OBT (Onboard      Training) material on the Lab VCAM (Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor)      system, then gathering tools from the IVA (Intravehicular Activity)      toolbox for the upcoming IFM (In-flight Maintenance) of VCAM cabling, Closing the JPM window      shutters as protection again solar heating [must be closed ~12 hrs      before Beta angles exceed +60 degrees], and Using another 90 min for      finishing up the stowage of US EVA tools used by Sasha & Sergei in the      recent Russian EVA-29 and by Ron & Mike on the earlier ULF7 spacewalk.    Fossum meanwhile –  Modified the WHC (Waste      &Hygiene Compartment) spare hygiene panel to be installed during      tomorrow’s UMS (Urine Monitoring System) assembly, Removed & replaced the      WHC’s EDV-U      container to support UMS checkout, i.e., swapping EDV-U #975 with EDV-U #933 (#933 will expire end of      August),  Changed communications      settings on an SSC’s COMM port for the UMS Interface Cable, and Reviewed UMS reference      material preparatory to tomorrow’s and Wednesday’s IFM, during      which Mike will assemble UMS hardware and perform a validation of the      system.    As a remaining post-EVA-29 activity, Andrey Borisenko re-integrated the Progress M-10M/42P (#410), docked at the DC-1 Docking Compartment, with the ISS by –  Conducting the standard      one-hour leak checking of the SU      docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between      Progress and DC1, Opening the DC-1/ SU transfer hatches, Opening the Progress/ SU transfer hatches      (on TsUP/Moscow      Go), Installing the BZV quick disconnect      screw clamps of the docking & internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) which rigidize      the joint, and Deactivating the      spacecraft’s electronics and installing the ventilation/heating air      duct (Russian thrusters were inhibited during the BZV installation).     FE-4 Volkov meanwhile performed post-EVA-29 closeout activities in the SM PkhO transfer tunnel and DC-1, reconfiguring the systems to nominal condition.   Sergey also had 1h 40m set aside for loading waste & excessed hardware on Progress M-11M/43P (#411) for disposal, plus updating the IMS database concurrently.     [43P is scheduled for undocking on 8/29.]   Later, FE-4 performed the periodic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before today’s installation of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning will be verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.]   Ron stowed three of the laptops reported as unused by the crew on 6/27 and gathered additional identifying information on two of them (for which no MCC-H record exists).        [The two “unknown” laptops are A31p machines #1106 & #1126 (they may be Russian A21p or A22p laptops; final location will depend on ownership).  A31p laptops #1096, #1108, #1104, #1128, and #2214 are “missing”, and if discovered are to be stowed for future return or disposal.]   Borisenko concluded his day by initiating recharge on the SONY HVR-Z7 camcorder battery for the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment.      [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from windows #9 & #6, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]   Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron Garan powers on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]   Shortly before sleep time, Aleksandr Samokutyayev will prepare the Russian MBI-12 Sonokard payload and start his 4th experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]   Sasha & Sergei had another hour to film documentary video of ”The Orbital Station. Life On Orbit”, to be used by Roskosmos on its TV channel.   At ~11:00am, Satoshi powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 11:10am conducted a ham radio session with students at the Caribbean Youth Science Forum in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, West Indies.     The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).   No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
