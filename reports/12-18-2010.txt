CSI-3/CGBA-5 (CGBA Science Insert #2/Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5):    Ongoing. CGBA-2 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 2):  Complete. CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), MDCA/Flex:    The goal of this investigation is to provide definition and direction for large scale fire suppression tests and selection of the fire suppressant for next generation crew exploration vehicles.On 12/8, three test points were successfully performed with four counting towards the science matrix (one test point was skipped).  The test points were performed with methanol fuel at a 1 atm chamber environment of 18% O2, 15% CO2, and 67% N2.  None of the test points used the support fiber.•  Test #1 - Droplet diameter of 4 mm. Good dispense with no bubbles.  There may have been some debris or particles in the droplet.  A very long burn (~ 30 sec) with no disruption.  The flame got dimmer throughout the early part of the test.  There appeared to have been some flame instability with definite flame oscillations in the first half of the test, but no flame extinction.  The flame then became stable with some small oscillations just prior to flame extinction.•  Test #2 - Droplet diameter of 3 mm.  Good dispense with no bubbles.  A few cloudy filaments appeared in the droplet briefly.  A good burn (no flame disruption) that lasted ~ 20 sec. •  Test #3 - Droplet diameter of 2 mm.  Good dispense with no bubbles.  A few cloudy filaments appeared, then moved around on the droplet.  A good burn with no disruptions visible.  The droplet drifted then burned to completion/extinction.On 12/9, four test points were successfully performed from the science matrix.  The test points used heptane fuel at the same chamber environment discussed above.  Once again, none of the test points used the support fiber.•  Test #4 - Droplet diameter of 4 mm.  Small particles were moving around in the droplet.  Very good deployment.  Very quick burn and flame extinction, very likely radiative extinction.  A vapor cloud formed some time after flame extinction.•  Test #5 - Droplet diameter of 3 mm. A few small particles were moving around in the droplet.  Droplet may have been slightly cloudy.  Very good deployment with very little motion after ignition.  Radiative extinction after about 2 sec of burn time.  A vapor cloud formed ~ 15 sec after the flame extinguished.•  Test #6 - Droplet diameter of 2.5 mm.  Observed contamination in the droplet during the fuel dispense.  Poor deployment.  The droplet moved quickly out of camera view shortly after (~ 1-2 sec) ignition. The flame oscillated then burned steadily.•  Test #7 - Droplet diameter of 2 mm.  Some residue still apparent on needles.  Droplet left camera view before flame extinction.  This could have been diffusive extinction.On 12/14, four test points were successfully performed from the science matrix.  The test points were performed with methanol fuel at a 1 atm chamber environment of 16% O2, 25% CO2, and 59% N2.  No support fiber used again.•  Test #8 - Droplet diameter of 4 mm. Excellent deployment with almost no residual motion.  Droplet burned with a flame that continued to grow and get dimmer.  Burn time was ~ 10 sec.  Flame oscillated before extinction, but the oscillations did not have the typical preferred (i.e. candle flame like) direction usually observed.  This may be because the droplet had almost no residual motion and there was no preferred direction (like in the direction of translation).•  Test #9 - Droplet diameter of 3 mm.  Similar to Test #8 with burn time of ~ 7 sec.•  Test #10 - Droplet diameter of 2 mm.  This droplet drifted.  The flame got dimmer (slightly) and shrunk with time before extinction.  No flame oscillations before extinction, the flame was spherical in one frame and extinguished the next frame.  Burn time was ~15 sec.•  Test #11 - Droplet diameter of 2.5 mm.  Similar to Test #10 except with a good deployment and almost no residual motion. Burn time was ~18 sec.It appears that we likely observed both radiative and diffusive extinction for these test conditions.  Given how close the transition is (2.5 mm diffusive, 3.0 mm radiative), we are likely approaching the flammability limit for this series of tests.  The decrement in ambient oxygen mole fraction should be smaller for the next series of tests. Commercial Photo (JAXA):   No report. CSLM-2 (Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures 2):    No report.

CEO (Crew Earth Observation):     Through 12/10, for Increment 26, the ground has received 4,524 of ISS CEO frames for review and cataloging.  “We are pleased to report your acquisition of the following targets with times corresponding to those of our daily CEO Target Request lists:  Kerguelen Islands, S. Indian Ocean-34 frames of this target were acquired-cloudiness was much more than we anticipated - we will continue to request this target; Arabia and Persian Gulf at night - still under review - a number of excellent views of important cities in this region such as Riyadh, Ad Dammam, Al Manamah, Doha and Abu Dhabi were acquired; and Ascension Island, Equatorial Atlantic Ocean - a number of good context views were acquired - we will continue to seek more views with less clouds.  As imagery requirements are met for our targets we are able to remove them from your Increment request lists.  A 11/30 view of the Las Vegas, NV Metropolitan area at night was published on NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  This is but one of numerous striking views of the Earth's cities at night that you have been acquiring for us.  We will be uplinking this article to you, look for it with next week's WSS. Your patiently developed skills using the Nikon DS3 digital camera for these targets is producing a bounty of beautiful nighttime photography of our planet.  Thanks for your fine efforts!”  CEO targets uploaded today were Storm Bay, Tasmania (HMS Beagle Site.  ISS had a nadir-viewing overpass of this bay on the southeastern coast of Tasmania.  Scattered cloud will have been present, but there may have been enough gaps in the cloud cover to collect useful imagery of the Bay.  Charles Darwin visited Storm Bay in 1836), Aurora Borealis (night-awake opportunity) and Moroni, Comoros (weather was predicted to be clear over the capital city of the Comoros Islands located between Africa and Madagascar.  The city is located on the western coast of Grande Comore Island.  Overlapping mapping frames of the city and surrounding rural areas were requested).
