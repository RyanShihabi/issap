With the decision today to move the OA7 launch to NET March 27, we have decided to move the IMMT OA7 Readiness Review from March 22 to March 27.  We will have the IMMT OA7 RR at 08:00 CDT on March 27 and if OA7 launches later that day, it would be around 18:49 CDT.   We will still have an IMMT this Wednesday, March 22, but the focus will be on the EVA Readiness Review, including the EPIC Ext R9 Transition Readiness Review.
