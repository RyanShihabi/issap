New Status:
Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) Status: Friday afternoon a UPA process cycle was aborted when the Fluids Control and Pump Assembly (FCPA) did not spin up to the required speed. Saturday morning new pump motor speed calibration parameters were loaded and the run was reattempted. UPA successfully processed for about 2 hours prior to shutting down due to a high Distillation Assembly (DA) condenser pressure indication. The leading theory is that the hose between the purge pump and the DA is clear of water, but there is still water in the DA condenser which intermittently is clogging the flow path. It is hoped that continued process runs followed by periods of cool down will help to remove excess water from the system. Three process runs have been attempted so far. The first attempt resulted in a shut down after about 2 hours of processing. The second and third attempts were both completed successfully. The crew has configured the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) to UPA and ground teams will continue to closely monitor UPA process runs.

NanoRacks Data Collection: Last week Marshburn installed NanoRacks Modules-20, 21 & 22 into the NanoRacks Platform which provides power and data transfer capabilities for the Modules containing student-developed experiments from various schools. Saturday, he completed a data collection session and transferred collected data to a laptop. Module-20 studies the effects of microgravity on remotely controlled robot control mechanisms and mechanical devices; studies the effects of a variable magnetic field on Ferrofluids in microgravity; studies the effects of microgravity on electroplating; studies the growth of E. coli bacteria in microgravity and its resistance to the antibiotic Kanamycin. Module-21 studies the fluctuation levels of carbon dioxide on ISS; studies the potential impact of microgravity on the growth cycle of bacteria; studies whether microgravity has an impact on the performance of current battery technology. Module-22 studies the possibility of producing alum crystals of higher purity in Space than on Earth; studies corrosion of iron in a microgravity environment; studies coalescence of polymers at different glass transition temperatures in space. Modules are scheduled to be returned to the students on 33 Soyuz.
Robonaut Tele-operation System (TeleOps): Marshburn conducted the first use of Robonaut TeleOps hardware and software today. He confirmed voice activation and controlled Robonaut’s head and hands via TeleOps. This configuration is different than previous Robonaut operations in that Robonaut’s movements were a mimicry of the crewmembers movements, as opposed to movements based on data commanding. The objective of the Robonaut Tele-operation System is to demonstrate the ability to effectively control Robonaut from the ISS. The research objective is to evaluate this control method in terms of its ability to perform tasks as well as measure the time necessary to complete the defined tasks. This capability will need to be developed to support future operations of Robonaut in the EVA environment as well as certain Intravehicular Activity (IVA) situations. Marshburn will conduct another TeleOps session tomorrow.
Human Research Facility (HRF) Urine Collection and Blood Draw: Cassidy began urine sample collection Saturday and completed collection today. He also started and completed drawing blood samples this morning, then configured and spun the blood samples in the Vascular Refrigerated Centrifuge. All samples were inserted in the Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) for return and analysis.
Environmental Health System (EHS) Water Sampling: The crew took water samples from the Potable Water Dispenser (PWD) and performed microbial testing and iodine analysis with the Colorimetric Water Quality Monitor Kit (CWQMK). The crew also attempted to prime the loops and analyze water from the PWD using the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA). During the run, the analysis was terminated due to a low auxiliary voltage reading. This error has been seen in the past and data will be downlinked for assessment. The crew did complete the planned TOCA Waste Water Bag (WWB) replacement and took a sample of the Water Recovery System (WRS). Samples will be returned on 33 Soyuz for ground analysis.
ENERGY Experiment Preparation: Hadfield prepared for tomorrow’s first of 10 runs of this experiment. He set up the Armband Activity Monitor, a device that monitors activity and assesses energy expenditure.  The monitor was positioned on the right tricep muscle and will be worn for the entire 10-day measurement period, after which the data will be downloaded to the Ground. A loss in astronauts’ body mass is a systematic observation during space flight. The aim of ENERGY is to measure changes in energy balance during long term space flight; measure adaptations in the components of the Total Energy Expenditure (consumption); and to derive an equation for the energy requirements of astronauts.
Binary Colloidal Alloy Test (BCAT)-C3 Multi-Flash Angle (MFA) Photos: Hadfield completed this task consisting of 5 photos taken at 5 different flash angles for each BCAT sample. When enhanced on the ground by the Payload Integrator (PI), these images will show the interface of the phase separation within the sample medium and give the PI great insight into determining if the sample has undergone phase separation, and whether it has remained unchanged since the last set of data was collected several years ago. This important data will make it possible to plan more precisely any future data collection from these samples. It will also provide a direct test of the longevity of these materials in the microgravity environment, giving further insight into these and a wide range of similar samples. BCAT documents the formation of crystals from microscopic spheres (known as colloids) suspended in a liquid, both on the surface of the sample container walls and in the bulk of the sample container. Results help scientists develop fundamental physics concepts previously unobserved due to the effects of gravity.
SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device): Hadfield, Cassidy and Marshburn performed this activity in support of the Nutrition experiment. SLAMMD provides an accurate means of determining the mass of the crew in microgravity. The guiding principle of SLAMMD follows that of Newton’s Second Law of Motion, F=ma (i.e., force is equal to mass times acceleration).  For the Human Research Facility (HRF) SLAMMD, the force is generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD 4 Process Unit (PU) drawer. The acceleration used in calculating the mass is actually a calculated average acceleration with regression analysis. The acceleration is measured through the use of a precise optical instrument which detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing. The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.

Previous Status (04/05/13)
High-Rate Communications System (HRCS) Post Installation: Today’s post installation activities consisted of the Ground conducting onboard video checkouts including Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) external cameras, JEM Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS), POIC, Columbus Video Cassette Recorder (VCR) and Floating Potential Measurement Unit (FPMU). Installation and checkout of the redundant Ku Comm Unit 1 is scheduled for next Thursday. It is anticipated that it will be completed in one day and required checkouts will be less extensive.
Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) Troubleshooting. Today the crew disconnected the purge line between the Distillation Assembly (DA) and Pressure Control and Pump Assembly (PCPA) and replaced it with a temporary hose. While this hose was in place ground controllers were able to purge the DA. The hose was then removed and the original hose was put back in place. After the crew transferred urine from an EDV (water container) to the WSTA (Water Storage Tank Assembly) ground teams attempted another UPA process cycle, which was unsuccessful.  Teams are assessing future trouble-shooting plans.
Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS) Experiment: Following yesterday’s preparations, FE-3 Cassidy conducted a run of the experiment. BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity and will guide strategies for extinguishing fires in microgravity. BASS results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth.
Health Maintenance System (HMS) Eye Exam – PanOptic: Commander (CDR) Hadfield and FE-6 Marshburn, acting alternately as Crew Medical Officer (CMO) and subject, performed this exam today. This procedure involves setup of the PanOptic ophthalmoscope and affiliated software to capture images of the eye for downlink and Ground analysis. Images collected include still and video images of the optic nerve.
Russian Segment (RS) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #32 Tool Gather: Hadfield gathered US tools and equipment which have been agreed to be used to support RS EVA #32 which is scheduled for April 19.
ENERGY Experiment: Marshburn completed day 10 of this 10-day experiment and transferred data to the Ground for analysis. Hadfield reviewed Big Picture words in preparation for starting his 10-day session next week. A loss in astronauts’ body mass is a systematic observation during space flight. The aim of ENERGY is to measure changes in energy balance during long term space flight; measure adaptations in the components of the Total Energy Expenditure (consumption); and to derive an equation for the energy requirements of astronauts.
Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR) Quick Disconnect (QD) Remove and Replace: Marshburn completed this activity that he began yesterday when he replaced the QD in the Combustion Chamber. Today he performs a leak check and verifies proper installation. This activity is in preparation for an experiment planned in Increments 39 and 40.
