ISS On-Orbit Status 03/10/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off duty. After breakfast, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   As most every Saturday, the six crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM.     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP). At ~9:55am EST, CDR Burbank turned on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and started the Ku-band data flow of video/data recorded during his recent (3/6) CFE-2 (Capillary Flow Experiments 2) payload activities to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about 4 hrs, Dan turned MPC routing off again. Burbank also disconnected the LTL (Low Temperature Loop) jumper on the CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) in Node-3 in support of its long-term deactivation.      [Yesterday, the Node-3 CDRA experienced another ASV-3 (Air Selector Valve) 3 failure, shutting the CDRA down, but the fan did not shut down.  Ground controllers were able to command the fan off.  The plan is to keep the Node-3 CDRA off until Monday while specialists review the data.  Both the USOS Lab CDRA and the RS (Russian Segment) Vozdukh CO2 removal system are operational and continue to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.] FE-6 Pettit conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Later, Don reconfigured the WRS (Water Recovery System) for collecting condensate in the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly / Waste Water Tank), after the recent IFM (Inflight Maintenance).  The WPA with the new CR (Catalytic Reactor) #2 is successfully processing condensate.        [Burbank’s inspection of the failed CR (Catalytic Reactor) #1 yesterday identified one leak on a fitting on the catalyst tube.  Pictures of the leak were sent down to the ground for analysis.  Dan then configured the failed catalytic reactor for stowage.  Ground teams will assess whether to fix this unit and leave it on-orbit as a spare, return it to the ground for refurbishment, or dispose of it.] Anatoly Ivanishin meanwhile handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] André Kuipers filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), his 8th.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] The CDR had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] FE-1 & FE-4 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Anton at ~5:00am, Oleg at ~6:45am EST. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on Lipetsk, Volga River delta, Allalin Glacier, and volcanoes San Cristobal Volcano, Stromboli, Mount Etna, Kilauea and Hierro volcano,·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). WRM Update:     A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (29-0008N) lists 28 CWCs (368.35 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (2 CWCs with 64.7 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria;  2. Condensate water (5 CWCs with 74.8 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (9 CWCs with 80.45 L plus 1 empty bag; also 7 expired bags with 121.8 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 6.4 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush). Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5L).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty/Thirty-One -- Week 24). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):    The experiment is continuing in Dewar 4 of MELFI-1.

BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):     Peter Lu has noted that back in October 2011, samples 3 and 5 had phase separated, but the phase boundary was very low-contrast.  This means that these samples were very close to the critical point in the phase diagram (above which phase separation is no longer present).  Peter doesn't presently see this happening in the pictures for BCAT-6, sample 5.  This means that sample 5 is either phase separating very SLOWLY, or that the lighting has changed.  If it is phase separating very slowly, then it is really close to the critical point, which is quite important.  Samples 1 and 5 will be looked at again in a week or two for granularity and phase separation.  A crystal search will be performed on samples 6 through 10 in a few weeks.        [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.
