ISS On-Orbit Status 03/27/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   FE-4 Kononenko completed the routine verification of yesterday’s automated refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.         [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the installation on 8/8/11 of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] CDR Burbank configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 4th (FD135) session of the ESA ICV Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, assisted by André Kuipers in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres.  At ~8:35am EDT, the CDR observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.        [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] FE-5 Kuipers conducted Part 1 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, today for the 29S crew, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to Oleg, Don and himself.  The 28S crew returned their dosimeters at wakeup after 24 hrs, followed tomorrow by the 29S crew.  After that, the dosimeters will be deployed statically in Part 2 of the protocol. After initiating 5-hr charging of the BAR TTM-2 battery at wakeup, Anton Shkaplerov & Anatoly Ivanishin used the KPT-2 payload and its BAR science instruments suite for measuring background noise near valves and in the window areas of SM, PkhO (Transfer Compartment) and DC1 with the AU-1 (Ultrasound Analyzer 1) which can detect and locate tiny leaks by listening for “hissing” noise.  With Piren-V and Iva-6A the crew also took structural temperatures at specific locations in the RS (Russian Segment) to locate cold spots on the pressurized shell and window areas.     [KPT-2 monitors problem areas, necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data are copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities are supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] Soyuz 29S crewmembers Kononenko, Pettit & Kuipers meanwhile joined up in their TMA-03M spacecraft (docked at the MRM1 Rassvet module) for the standard 3-hr Soyuz Emergency Descent Drill, a regular procedure for each station crew.  The exercise, which does not involve any command activation, uses computer simulation (Trenasher Spusk/”descent trainer”) on the RSK1 A31p laptop (swapped with RSK1 T61p for this exercise), with a descent hand controller (RUS) in manual mode to set up reentry conditions and switch between modes.  Operators were Oleg & André, each performing 3 runs, with max-g and deviation results logged.  The two RSK1 laptops were later swapped again.     [The OBT (onboard training) session, supported by TsUP instructor tagup, included a review of the pertinent RODF (Russian Operations Data Files), specifically the books on Soyuz Insertion & Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situation Procedures such as manual undocking.] Dan Burbank & Don Pettit continued the ongoing outfitting of the ISS to upgrade the ISS Ku-band system with the HRCS (High Rate Communication System), today routing & installing a Ku-CU (Ku-band Comm Unit) Ethernet Y-cable (W9688) inside the AV-3 (Avionics 3) Rack at Lab D2 in preparation for PEHG (Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway) upgrades.       [When fully installed and operational, HRCS will provide substantially faster uplink & downlink speeds, improved bandwidth, two extra S/G (Space/Ground) voice loops, two extra video downlink channels, and contingency Ku Commanding capability.  It will also allow additional data to be downlinked from the P/L (Payload) and C&C (Command & Control) MDMs through Ku-band using the MDM Ethernet cables routed by the crew during the EPIC (Enhanced Processor & Integrated Communications) work completed earlier in the Increment.  This new functionality will be achieved through three major upgrades: Improved APS (Automated Payload Switch) installations (already completed during Increment 28), improved PEHG (Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway) installations, and the Ku-CU installations.  The PEHG and Ku-CU installations are not scheduled until at least October 2012.  To prepare for their arrival, a number of cable routing and other tasks are required and are being done early, today’s one being one of them.] Oleg terminated overnight charging of the GFI-1 battery, then installed & started the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 for another run, using it to measure UV (ultraviolet) emissions in Earth’s upper atmosphere during global electromagnetic events (10:50am-11:10am EDT).   Later, FE-4 dismantled the equipment and dumped the data from Laptop 3 via the RSS1 terminal.       [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] Anatoly had another ~4.5 hrs for loading the Progress 46P cargo ship with excessed equipment and trash, transferred from the ISS. With the G1 camcorder set for live downlink to Earth, Dan removed the crank handle of the ARED advanced resistive exercise device and replaced it with a new spare. Oleg unstowed & prepared equipment required for first ingress in the ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) after its arrival.      [Included are Draeger air samplers, half-masks, absorber cartridges, high-performance filters and associated jumpers.] Also in preparation for ATV docking, André performed a voice check with the ATV-CC (Command Center/Toulouse), initiated by CAPCOM (in Houston) or GLAVNI (in Moscow). Afterwards, FE-5 used two CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-O2) units (#1043, #1048) to take oxygen partial pressure readings in the Lab (21.8%/21.8%) and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory, 21.8%/21.8%). Pettit completed the monthly maintenance of the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, checking its components, pin alignment, rack centering and the snubber jam nut witness marks.        [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- & Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm; their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.] In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Don performed the periodic (~monthly) reboot of the SLT (System Laptop Terminal) laptop. Shkaplerov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anton also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur) FE-1 had ~2h 50m set aside for another round of filming more “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY camcorder.  This is part of the ongoing effort to create a “Life on the Station” photo & video documentary database on the flight of ISS-30 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Before sleeptime, FE-1 will initiate battery charging for the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware.     [The FSS system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] Dan & Don had a time slot reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] André worked ~1.5 hrs in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), continuing the cleanup of the PMM by relocating stowage items from the “corridor” to final locations to enable creation of a trash staging area prior to Progress loading. FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 & FE-5 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, André at ~7:45 am, Anatoly at ~1:05pm, Oleg at ~1:30pm, Anton at ~2:20pm EDT. At ~3:55pm EDT, Dan Burbank will power up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 4:05pm conduct a ham radio session with students at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4).       [FE-6 is on the special experimental PRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for T2, with ARED+T2 and CEVIS following in the next 2 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  After his T2 session, Pettit closed down the T2 software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display. Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the volcanoes Stromboli, Mt. Etna, Hudson & Kilauea, and Darwin Island;A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Valletta, Malta (World Capitals Collection Site: The Maltese islands of Gozo and Malta in the central Mediterranean Sea lie about 100 miles south of the large island of Sicily.  The capital city of Valletta with a population of just over 6,000 is located on the north coast of the larger island of Malta), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (World Capitals Collection Site: This capital city of about 3.5 million lies in the heart of the Ethiopian Highlands at an elevation 7,726 ft.  As ISS passed SE over the highlands, the crew was to look for the landmark, dark vegetated areas north of the city and try to capture the entire urban area in a single frame), and Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire (World Capitals Collection Site: ISS had a late morning pass in partly cloudy weather over this capital city of about a quarter of a million.  It is located in the south-central part of the country, just SE of the large man-made Lake Kossou on the Bandama River.  At this time, as ISS approached from the NW, the crew was to look for single-frame views of the city).
