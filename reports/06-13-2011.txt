ISS On-Orbit Status 06/13/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  Crew off duty.  Underway: Week 13 of Increment 27/28. Happy Russia Day! Den’ Rossii, 6/12, is Russia’s National Holiday (established by Boris Yeltsin to celebrate national unity after the Russian parliament in 1990 formally declared its sovereignty), with large crowds in Red Square in Moscow, extending to today, 6/13.  FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum undertook their first weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done in Mondays.       [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]  For the last INTEGRATED IMMUNE crew health survey, FE-3 Garan completed the survey forms on an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop and emailed the file to the experiment PI (Principal Investigator). Garan also performed the weekly health check of the O2 sensor in CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) #1045, which has exceeded its shelf life.     [The health check, using both the #1045 and the #1046 unit, was performed in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) since both MCAs (Major Constituency Analyzers) are currently down, i.e., unavailable for calibration, while  the COL PPOS (Partial Pressure Oxygen Sensor) could be used for comparison.  Afterwards, both CSA-O2s were deactivated and stowed.] CDR Borisenko serviced the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), setting up eight new Bubble dosimeters and taking documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera of their deployment locations, which were also reported to TsUP via log sheet via OCA.      [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.] After activating the RSE-1 laptop, FE-1 Samokutyayev prepared the log files of recent (5/31 & 6/8) runs of the FSS system of the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging payload for downlink to the ground.      [FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] FE-4 Volkov turned off the GA/gas analyzer (KM0305M1) in the Soyuz TMA-02M/27S (#702) spacecraft, docked at MRM1 Rassvet, while Sasha deactivated the one in Soyuz TMA-21/26S (#231), docked at MRM2 Poisk.    [The GA’s are activated periodically to check the cabin air in the Descent Modules.] Sergei also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module).      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Ron Garan unstowed METOX (Metal Oxide) canisters #0021 & #0005 and initiated their regeneration in the US A/L (Airlock) “bakeout” oven.     [Recyclable METOX canisters replaced the old one-way/expendable LiOH (lithium hydroxide) canisters as carbon dioxide (CO2) removal system in the EMU/spacesuits in 2001.  During use, CO2 is absorbed by them and later removed through a special valve opening by “baking” (heating), which takes place in a special oven in the A/L.] Furukawa & Fossum prepared their individual CEVIS (cycle ergometer with vibration isolation) PCMCIA memory cards by inserting them into their personal SSC (Station Support Computer), to be loaded with their exercise protocols by OCA uplink from the ground.     [Deferred from yesterday due to missing exercise shoes.] Satoshi also completed his POMS (Profile of Mood States) questionnaire for downlink to ground specialist. At ~5:55am EDT, Borisenko, Volkov & Samokutyayev joined up to support several Russian PAO TV downlinks, transmitting deferred video messages of greetings and congratulations to four ground events: (1) to the graduates of RANKhiGS (Russian Economics & Civil Service) Academy, (2) to the participants of the 10th International Forum “Mail Carriage 2011” on June 21-23 in the Constantine Palace in St. Petersburg, (3) to the participants of the 10th Anniversary session of the international “Slavic Commonwealth” youth project on June 15-24 in Kursk, and (4) to the participants in the all-Russian graduation ball for high school students of 2011, “Graduate – 2011”, on June 23 in the State Kremlin Palace. At ~11:50am, Garan, Fossum & Furukawa downlinked three deferred PAO TV messages of greetings: (1) to the City of Gdansk, Poland, at the public opening of a new soccer stadium on June 23, and in commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the birth of Astronomer Johannes Hevelius (German: Johannes Hewel, in the Pomeranian city of Danzig, today Gdansk), (2) to the National Geographic Inaugural Evening of Exploration on June 23, focusing on oceans this year, and (3) to the City of Mitchell, IN, home of Mercury Astronaut Gus Grissom, for their 50th anniversary celebration of Grissom’s flight on Liberty Bell 7 on July 21. At ~3:45pm, Ron is scheduled for his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). FE-5 & FE-6 were scheduled for their 4th post-launch PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Mike at ~10:32am, Satoshi at ~1:32pm. Before “Presleep” period tonight, Garan will power on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-4).  Volkov exercised for half of the protocol, on the VELO. ISS Reboosts:   Yesterday’s two ISS reboosts by ATV2’s OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters were highly precise, resulting in a mean altitude increase of 19.3 km (10.5 nmi).  Purpose: to deplete ATV2 of remaining propellant and set up phasing for 43P and ULF7:·         Reboost 1:  10:15am EDT: Duration 36 min 06 sec, delta-V 5.2 m/s (17.1 ft/s).  Mean altitude gain: 9.2 km (5 nmi).·         Reboost 2:  2:20pm: Duration 40 min 12 sec, delta-V 5.8s (19.0 ft/s).  Mean altitude gain: 10.1 km (5.5 nmi). No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked today.  (Current daylight-awake orbit tracks have transitioned into a seasonal pattern in which they temporarily parallel the terminator.  Consequently most of the nadir views of CEO target areas fall below the criteria for illumination, with darkness to the right of track and adequate lighting left of track.  Today none of the standard target areas has sufficient illumination.  This condition is expected to persist for the next 7-10 days.  Meanwhile, CEO researchers are continuing to look for dynamic events targets for which oblique views to left of track may be useful or nighttime targets.  Auroral activity in the Northern Hemisphere has spiked recently with the dramatic solar flare on 6/7.  May-June is also the seasonal peak period for observing noctilucent clouds (a.k.a. polar mesospheric clouds) in the Northern Hemisphere.)
