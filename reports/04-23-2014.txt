Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #26: Today, Mastracchio (EV1) and Swanson (EV2) successfully performed an EVA to remove and replace External (EXT)-2 Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MDM). Once the MDM was installed, ground teams powered on the new MDM, loaded software, and configured it as a viable backup. The MDM had previously failed on April 11,2014. The EV crew also performed a get ahead task to remove SPDA door lanyards and Push In Pull (PIP) pins from both doors then characterized the type of force (impulse vs. steady) required to open and close the doors. The characterization will help with possible Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) operations in the future. Today’s EVA commenced with hatch opening at 8:56am CDT and ended with a Phase Elapsed Time (PET) of 1 hour 36 minutes.
53 Progress (53P) Undocking: Progress 53P vehicle undocked from the Russian Segment Service Module at 3:58am CDT.  The Progress will remain in orbit then perform a test to re-rendezvous and dock with ISS later this week on April 25th.  The test will demonstrate its ability to automatically complete a full rendezvous and docking with the Kurs-NA System. 53P is the second Progress to test the Kurs-NA system, an improvement to Kurs-A, which will be part of the upgraded Progress-MS vehicles.
SpaceX-3 (SpX-3) Dragon Status: Dragon systems are healthy and operating nominally. Trunk camera checkouts were completed in preparation for Optical PAyload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS) and High Density Earth View (HDEV) extraction scheduled to occur next week.
