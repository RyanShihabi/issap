Today’s Planned Tasks Orbital Launch: Orb-1 launched successfully from Pad 0A at Wallops Flight Facility at 12:07 pm CST today.  This was the first flight of the Castor 30B upper stage.  Ascent and separation events were all nominal.   The Cygnus solar arrays were successfully deployed shortly after spacecraft separation.  All Cygnus systems are nominal at this time.  The first phasing burn (DV1) is scheduled for 5:24 pm CST today, with additional burns planned to occur overnight.  Capture is planned for Sunday, January 12th at approximately ~5:02 am CST. Cygnus will deliver 2,780 pounds of science experiments, hardware, and crew provisions to the ISS.
Ocular Health (OH) Measurements: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Hopkins and FE-6 Wakata, alternating as the Crew Medical Officer and subject, with ground experts providing remote support, perform tonometry tests and take blood pressure measurements each of other.  This is Hopkins’ flight day 90 session of Ocular Health and Wakata’s flight day 60 session.  Researchers believe that the measurement of visual, vascular and central nervous system changes over the course of this experiment and during the subsequent post flight recovery will assist in the development of countermeasures, clinical monitoring strategies and clinical practice guidelines.
Circadian Rhythms:  Today Wakata completed his third 36 hour Circadian Rhythms session.  The ESA Circadian Rhythms experiment examines the role of synchronized circadian rhythms (the human body’s 24 hour light-dark cycle) and its maintenance during long duration spaceflight.  Understanding how changes in body composition, body temperature regulation and physical activity affect circadian rhythms will support development of enhancements for performance and health care of future crewmembers.
Radiation Dosimetry Inside ISS-Neutrons 2 (RaDI-N2) Space Bubble Detector Deploy:  FE-5 Mastracchio deployed 8 “bubble detectors” in a special pouch in the JEM for the third of four runs in the ISS.  Radi-N2 is a follow-on investigation of RaDI-N1 and the Matroshka-R experiments.  RaDI-N2 is designed to characterize the neutron radiation environment inside the ISS. The 8 neutron “bubble detectors” are attached to fixed locations inside the ISS, including one is carried by a crewmember. The results of this investigation will be used to define the risk to ISS crewmembers’ health and in the development of advanced protective measures for future space flights.
Material Science Laboratory (MSL) Solidification and Quench Furnce (SQF) Sample Cartridge Exchange:  Mastracchio removed a used sample cartridge from the SQF and replace it with Columnar-to-Equiaxed Transition in Solidification Processing-2 (CETSOL-2) test sample 2. This investigation aims to deepen the understanding of the physical principles that govern solidification processes in metal alloys. The patterns of the crystals resulting from transitions of liquids to solids is of substantial importance to processes in producing materials such as solar cells, thermoelectrics, and metal alloys.
