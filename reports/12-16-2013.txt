External Thermal Control System (ETCS) Loop A Status:  ETCS Loop A is still operating without full temperature control.  All Loop A Interface Heat Exchangers (IFHX) remains bypassed and isolated, preventing internal heat rejection on loop A.  ETCS Loop B continues to operate nominally.  MCC-H continues to perform tests on ETCS Loop A to determine if they can regain enough temperature control to allow IFHX reintegration.  Due to the loss of heat rejection for the Node 2 Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL), half of the loads in the Node 2, JEM and Columbus modules remain powered off.
 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Materials Review:  FE-3 Hopkins, FE-5 Mastracchio, and FE6 Wakata reviewed EVA materials associated with replacing the ETCS Loop A Pump Module.  Included in the package was an overview of each of the three potential EVAs, summary timelines, procedures, translations paths, pump module diagrams and photographs.    
Equipment Lock Preparation: In support of the potential EVA, Hopkins and Mastracchio prepared drink bags, BIO Medical equipment, prebreathe equipment, and verified required hardware was located in the Airlock.
EVA Mobility Unit (EMU) On-Orbit Fit Check:  Hopkins and Mastracchio donned their EMUs to verify correct EMU sizing prior to possibly performing an EVA to replace the ETCS Loop A Pump Module.  During this test the EMU comm and data signals were also checked out successfully. 
EMU Helmet Absorption Pad (HAP) Familiarization: Hopkins and Mastracchio familiarized themselves with the absorption properties of the HAP.  They then reported saturation results and downlinked video to the ground.
