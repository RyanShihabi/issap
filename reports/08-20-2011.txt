ISS On-Orbit Status 08/20/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Saturday �C Crew off-duty day. As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, CDR Borisenko performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel. Borisenko also inspected the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, checking for proper fan operation by testing the air flow from the ventilators BO A04 & BO A05 and verifying that both LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are lit.      [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]  First thing after wake-up, FE-3 Garan opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Garan will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] The six crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).  As part of today’s uborka, FE-6 Fossum took documentary photographs of the RGSH AORG (Return Grid Sensor Housing add-on screens) at COL D0 before and after going over them with the vacuum cleaner (to be compared with pictures taken during previous cleaning to establish the quantity of debris captured during the week).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of the uborka house cleaning, CDR Borisenko & FE-1 Samokutyayev & FE-4 Volkov completed regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM, and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. FE-4 Volkov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~8:35am EDT, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. Day 2 of the three-day test series of the Russian ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) ASN-M Satellite Navigation System which requires Borisenko to monitor communications between the RSK2 A31p laptop with the test program and the three active ASN NPM-1, NPM-3 & NPM-4 navigation electronics modules every 2 hrs during work hours.       [The objective of the test is to confirm that array configurations for ATV docking in positive Solar Beta angles do not create unacceptable multipathing for the ASN RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System).  Both TRRJs (Thermal Radiator Rotary Joints) and both SARJs (Solar Alpha Rotary Joints) plus the 1B, 2B, 3A & 4A BGAs (Beta Gimbal Assemblies) were placed in Directed position for this test (i.e., not autotrack).  The test will include 4 different array configurations, with periods of autotrack in between for power generation recovery.  The test is planned to be complete late Sunday evening.  A second ATV RGPS test at negative Betas is planned for 9/1 through 9/4.] Ron Garan performed the monthly maintenance/inspection of the T2/COLBERT treadmill system and its components, checking pin alignment, rack centering, snubbers and the snubber jam nut witness marks.       [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- & Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm.  Their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.] For his on-going 2nd (FD30) Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment, FE-5 Furukawa observed the initial 10-min rest period before going about his business, swapping Makita batteries as required.  Midpoint for the entire ICV run was reached at about 12:40pm, after which the second 24h data collection period was started.         [The rest period involves relaxing & breathing normally for 10 minutes under quiet, restful conditions.  ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres/BP to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Satoshi continued the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing were timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After approximately 24 hrs, the Cardiopres was temporarily doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery were changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).  The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.] With the Russian Elektron oxygen generator currently inactive, Volkov was to initiate another refresh of the ISS interior with an O2 repress from Progress 43P tankage on Go-ahead from TsUP-Moscow.     [The O2 (oxygen) & N2 (nitrogen) storage tanks of 43P should be empty now.] Mike Fossum & Satoshi Furukawa each volunteered for doing a VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) program today.  For his selected VolSci activity, another session with the SHERE (Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment) payload, Mike first activated the EDR ERB-2 (European Drawer Rack / Erasmus Recording Binocular) and the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) from its laptop, then conducted two consecutive experiment runs, each with an FM (Fluid Module, #50 & #52), unstowed & retrieved from the CGBA (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus) and restowed after its run.  At the conclusion later today, FE-6 will transfer the experiment data and turn off the equipment, including MSG and its A31p laptop (ERB-2 turned itself off after 1h 20m).          [Background:  Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of an applied stress (“preshearing” = rotation) which might be, for example, a shear stress or extensional stress.  In practice, rheology is principally concerned with extending the "classical" disciplines of elasticity and (Newtonian) fluid mechanics to materials whose mechanical behavior cannot be described with the classical theories.  SHERE is designed to study the effect of preshear (rotation) on the transient evolution of the microstructure and viscoelastic tensile stresses for solutions with long chains of monodisperse dilute polymer molecules in the MSG.  Collectively referred to as “Boger fluids,” these polymer solutions have become a popular choice for rheological studies of non-Newtonian fluids and are the non-Newtonian fluid used in this experiment.  The SHERE hardware consists of the Rheometer, Camera Arm, Interface Box, Cabling, Keyboard, Tool Box, Fluid Modules, and Stowage Tray.] Furukawa’s VolSci selection consisted of an EPO (Educational Payloads Operation) session with the JAXA EPO-7 “Doctor in Space” demonstration.      [With the CANON G1 camcorder set up for recording, Satoshi provided explanations about medical care and health management in space, as well as the changes which the human body will undergo in response to environmental changes.  The downlinked footage will be edited for use as educational material in aerospace medicine.  The implementation of this video-taking project is planned for two sessions, one each for Increments 28 & 29 resp.] Ron & Mike filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~8:10am EDT, Sergei Volkov supported a Russian PAO TV event from the RS (Russian Segment), downlinking, a message of greetings to the Shchyolkov Region on the occasion of its 82nd anniversary, to be celebrated on 8/26 at Shchyolkov’s House of Culture, attended by delegations from sister-cities of Germany, Finland, Poland, Ukraine, Latvia, and Russia.     [“My cordial greetings and best wishes on yet another anniversary of Shchyolkov Region on behalf of the International Space Station Crew!  For historical reasons, the Cosmonaut Training Center at Star City is located on Shchyolkov’s soil.  All cosmonauts who received their training at various times here care about the history and traditions of our area, its successes and great folk.  I, for one, had a chance to grow up here, finish school, get my profession of a cosmonaut, and carry out my second flight in the year of the 50th anniversary of Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin’s flight…”] At ~10:15am, Sergei had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).

We've also noted with interest your unsolicited nighttime views: auroral activity was weak and illumination was poor, but you did acquire some views of displays - better still were some of your noctilucent cloud shots - also, your skill with cities at night is improving with a number of visually striking sessions acquired.  We will begin calling these out as targets as conditions permit.  Your unique and rare view of a Perseid Meteor was published on the NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website this week as an Image of the Day feature - nice timing!
