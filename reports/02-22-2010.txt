ISS On-Orbit Status 02/22/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  Crew off duty.  Underway: Week 13 of Increment 22  STS-130/Endeavour (ISS-20A) returned to Earth safely last night on the first opportunity, landing at KSC at 10:22pm EST (wheel stop) after a flight duration of 13d 18h 06min 24s and 5,739,000 stat.mi. covered distance.    [During the flight, Endeavour delivered Node-3/Tranquility and the Cupola, both of which were installed and outfitted during three EVAs.  It was the 130th Shuttle mission, the 24th flight of Endeavour and the 32nd Shuttle/ISS assembly flight.  Its landing was the 73rd landing at the Cape and the 17th night landing there.  After a docked duration of 9d 19h 48m, Endeavour left the ISS with a total mass of 799,045 lbs and 98% completion.]   At wake-up, FE-1 Suraev did the regular daily “early-morning” check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-1 again inspects the filters tonight before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Also in the morning, CDR Williams, FE-5 Noguchi & FE-6 Creamer completed another Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  A total of 121 RST runs are assigned to Jeff for the duration of his orbital stay.]  Before breakfast & first exercise, all crewmembers except TJ Creamer took a full session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis.  Afterwards, Suraev closed out and stowed the Urolux hardware.     [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).  Kotov performed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated tonight at ~4:15pm EST before the docking, followed tomorrow by regeneration of Bed #2.  (Last time done: 1/11-1/12/10).     [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.]  The CDR activated and visually inspected the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), after which the FE-5 Noguchi installed a loose connector of the SODI (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument) experiment hardware in the MSG WV (Work Volume).  Afterwards, Noguchi worked in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), inspecting and cleaning the debris screens of CDAs (Cabin Depressurization Assemblies) located on the feedthrough panels in the COL portside cone area.  Soichi also calibrated the two new hand-held CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen, #1041, #1045) instruments for first use after their delivery on 20A and sufficient time for outgassing any residuals.  In the SM (Service Module), Oleg conducted periodic maintenance on the deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control & Atmospheric Monitoring System behind panel 449 by replacing its CO2 filter assembly (BF) with a new unit from FGB stowage (done last: 1/12/10).    [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO2, O2, and H2O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed. The filter replacement was not done on 2/20 as reported here; instead, a calibration check with its IG-3 oxygen (O2) sensor unit was performed.]  FE-1 & FE-4 had their periodic PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Max at ~12:15pm, Oleg at ~2:05pm EST.  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-1/2x, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5).  WRM Update:  A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.     [The new card (22-0003L) lists 101 CWCs (2,410.9 L total) for the five types of water now identified on board: 1. technical water (21 CWCs with 801.3 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 107.5 L in 5 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 559.6 L in 13 bags still requiring sample analysis,  2. potable water (9 CWCs with 366.7 L, of which 1 bag with 23.0 L contains Wautersia, 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis & 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use,  3. iodinated water (63 CWCs with 1129.8 L),  4. condensate water (1 bag with 28.1 L [known leaker], 2 empty CWCs, 3 bags with 62.7 L) and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (2 CWCs with 22.3 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]  C&C MDM Failure:    Yesterday morning, the C&C MDM (Command & Control Multiplexer/Demultiplexer computer) and its backup aboard the ISS were shut down by their safety functions due to file corruption caused by faulty telemetry uploads of new Node-3 software from the VTC (Vital Telemetry Telecommand Computer) at MCC-Houston.  Remedial actions are underway, and the backup MDM is being synchronized to take over.  All other systems have returned to their nominal configurations.   No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
