ISS On-Orbit Status 08/07/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – EVA-15 day.  US EVA-15 by EV1 Doug Wheelock & EV2 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson was terminated without Loop A PM (Pump Module) removal because of a leak at one (M3) of the four QDs (Quick Disconnects) connecting the ammonia lines to the failed PM of the starboard EATCS (External Active Thermal Control System) during demate activities.  Torque on the 4 PM bolts remains unbroken.     [After Wheelock reconnected the M3 QD on the PM to stop the leak, not enough suit time remained to allow further PM work, due to the time necessary for the crew’s cleanup procedures for assuring than no ammonia was introduced into the pressurized volume of the ISS.  EV1 & EV2 began their “campout” last night in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe.  Following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Caldwell-Dyson & Wheelock at 2:35am-3:45am, the A/L hatch was closed again by Shannon Walker & Fyodor Yurchikhin for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge (~5:15am-5:30am) and prebreathe in the EMUs (~5:30am-6:20am).  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-15 began at 7:19am EDT.  It ended at 3:22pm, lasting 8h 3 min – the longest ISS-EVA and the sixth-longest EVA in history.  It was the 148th spacewalk for ISS assembly & maintenance, and the 240th for US astronauts, with a total time of 929 hrs 38 min.]    Before the EVA, FE-6 Walker –  Printed out instructions      for actions to be taken in case of occurrence of a “next worst      failure”, e.g. MBSU 2 (Main Bus Switching      Unit 2) failure, ETCS Loop B failure, File Server crash, etc.,  Completed the IV      (Intravehicular) portion of the EVA “inhibit pad”, i.e., the      list of temporary external deactivations in support of the EVA, Set up the RWS (Robotic      Workstation) and DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) peripherals      with the IPV (International Procedures Viewer) laptop to support SSRMS      (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) ops, and Operated the SSRMS,      “flying” Douglas Wheelock during the EVA.    During the spacewalk, CDR Skvortsov assisted Walker on the SSRMS, and FE-5 Yurchikhin worked with her supporting the Campout, prebreathe, EVA prep & post-EVA activities.    At wake-up, Fyodor Yurchikhin performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspected the filters before bedtime this morning, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]   Alex Skvortsov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   FE-2 & FE-4 had their standard post-EVA PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Wheels at ~3:50pm, Tracy at ~3:25pm EDT.   Before their sleeptime, Caldwell-Dyson, Wheelock & Walker were to complete another run of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, today only once.     [The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]   The Russian crewmembers worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-3, FE-5), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).

CEO (Crew Earth Observations):   "Through 8/4 the ground has received a total of 2,254 frames of E-24 CEO imagery for review and cataloging.  “We are pleased to report your acquisition of the following targets with times corresponding to those of our daily CEO Target Request lists:    Mississippi Delta Region – excellent views of this target area with sun glint enhancement of oil sheen in the water – publication is planned for this imagery; Aral Sea – good views acquired – under evaluation; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan – good views acquired – all requirements for this target have been met; Ankara, Turkey – good views – all requirements for this target have been met; Valletta, Malta – excellent views – target requirements met; Rabat, Morocco – good imagery – requirements met; Coast Mountains, BC, Canada – imagery of target acquired – still seeking detailed views of the Silverthrone Glacier; Edwards Plateau Land-use, TX – context views acquired, but unanticipated popcorn cumulus were present – we will continue to request this target.  Your recent 1000mm view of the Dominic Point Fire, Montana was published in the Natural Hazards section NASA/GSFC Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  This fire is believed to have been started by a lightning strike in a remote area of the Bitterroot National Forest of western Montana and was first reported to the US Forest Service less than an hour before you spotted it from the ISS and acquired this high-detail photo.  Thanks for your vigilance, prompt notification, and downlink of your imagery of this dynamic event."    CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Muscat, Oman (looking left on the coast where a series of small bays and headlands protects this port city), Monaco, Monaco (looking right of track on Portugal’s largest estuary), Nyiragongo Volcano, Rep. Congo (overlapping images left and right of track are requested.  The volcano is forested compared with the surrounding farmland which is a lighter-toned green), Kigali, Rwanda (looking left for the urban zone which contrasts with the surrounding farmlands), Maseru, Lesotho (this small capital city lies on the border between Lesotho and South Africa.  Visual cues are (i) this prominent border [between relatively devegetated Lesotho and the greener farmlands of South Africa], and (ii) a major angle in the border beyond Maseru [as seen from orbit]), Gulf of Mexico oil slick (Dynamic event.  ISS passed over the center of the area most affected by the slick.  Best images were in the region near the glint point, a fraction left of track, and forward of the nadir point), Havana, Cuba (nadir view of Havana.  Havana on the north coast of Cuba, well centered in this handheld view), Kingston, Jamaica (Kingston lies left of track: look on the furthest large bay from track), and South Amazonian Fan, Brazil (one of the least visible river fans on the planet [due to cloud] is the Roosevelt River fan in central Brazil.  A series of overlapping images, looking nadir and right of track, was requested during this cloud-free period.  The fan appears as a series of curved, light-toned lines, which are the relict courses of ancient rivers. From track, the fan appears sandwiched between two good visual cues — the very large Madeira River uptrack, and a major trans-Amazon highway downtrack.  Only one image of this large feature exists in the handheld database.  Very large alluvial fans [up to hundreds of km in length] were recognized as a new class of landform, mainly on the basis of handheld imagery).
