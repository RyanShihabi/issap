ISS On-Orbit Status 01/11/11  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  FE-4 Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  FE-1 Kaleri began the day by tending to the current experiment session with the Russian/German KPT-21 Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall/PK-3+) payload, activating the turbopump in the MRM2 “Poisk” module for keeping the vacuum chamber (EB) evacuated.  The turbopump will be deactivated again before sleeptime, at ~4:25pm EST.    [Main objective of PK-3 is to study wave propagation and dispersion ratio in a dust plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber, at a specified power of HF discharge, pressure, and a varied number of particles.]  CDR Kelly completed the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.     [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.]  In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-5 Nespoli continued his boardside support of the on-going ground-controlled HTV HCP (H-II Transfer Vehicle / Hardware Command Panel) checkout activities.     [Steps included running an HCP selfcheck and monitoring the ground testing the HCP for PROX (Proximity Operations) Baseband function, PROX GPSR data status and reception of the HCP-sent command at the ground HTV simulator in Tsukuba/Japan.]  In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Paolo powered up the EPM (European Physiology Module) 28V laptop from the LUDB (Left Utility Distribution Panel) and updated its PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) application for the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment with a new software version.  In the US Lab, Paolo supported ground ops on the FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack) by removing its alignment guides to allow ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) to be activated before beginning FIR operations that require a microgravity environment.  Later in the day, Cady Coleman re-installed the 4 alignment guides to lock down ARIS.     [Alignment guides need to be installed with slots clocked in different directions to protect the rack from external loading events such as dockings and reboosts.]   Then, Nespoli set up the Lab camcorder to provide the ground with live view of crew activities for monitoring ground-commanded FIR ARIS position control stability testing.  FE-5 also cleared the COL endcone at stowage locations D4 & O4 to make room for SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) operations.  Paolo then set up the SLAMMD hardware for its upcoming use.  At ~3:30am EST, FE-6 Coleman set up the CANON G1 video camcorder at the earth-facing Cupola window #2 to support ESA in recording footage of the overflown Earth surface.  The recording was terminated about 70 mins later.   Skripochka & Kaleri, with TsUP support, conducted the standard 30-min intermodular space-to-space (wireless) test of the TORU teleoperated rendezvous & docking system, i.e., between the TORU control station in the SM and Progress 40P (#408), docked at DC1 nadir.  Progress DPO (Approach & Attitude Control) thrusters were not commanded.  The test was performed on DO1 at 1:00pm-1:35pm EDT.    [TORU is the manually teleoperated backup approach and docking system for the automated Progress ships.]   Kondratyev completed the periodic transfer of condensate water to an RS EDV container for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis into oxygen & hydrogen, filling the designated KOV (condensate water) EDV container from US CWCs (Contingency Water Containers).  When filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.     [The ~40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the Elektron’s BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles are detected in the EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O2 generator.]  Working several hours of outfitting in the SM (Service Module), Alex Kaleri installed ATV PCE (Automated Transfer Vehicle / Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) hardware (which he had taken out on 11/5/10).        [Specifically, Sasha laid out the associated BKS cabling and installed the PCE Z0000 prox comm box and BUAP antenna switching control box.  MBRL will be used for the approach & docking of the European ATV-2 “Johannes Kepler”, to be launched 2/15/2011.  The PCE system was assembled and checked out by ESA/TsUP last October, to verify proper operation of the PCE WAL3 (Low Gain) and WAS2 (Medium Gain) antennas as well as the PCE equipment internal to the SM.  The WAL3 & WAS2 antennas are prime for ATV Rendezvous operations.  As part of the October checkout, the PCE equipment was activated, directed to perform a self-test and switched to CW (Carrier Wave) mode.  After an attitude maneuver that maximized coverage for the antenna(s) being tested, the PCE transmitted a beacon signal to ESA’s Maspalomas (MAS) and Villafranca (VIL) Ground Stations.  The ground stations at that time tracked the ISS, checked that the CW signal was received, verified the proper RF power level, and recorded the evolution of the RF power level over time.  For the duration of the maneuvers, Lab, JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and Node-3 Cupola windows were shuttered and the SARJ (Solar Alpha Rotary Joint) was feathered (arrays facing Russian thrusters edge-on).]  As part of HTV2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle) Rendezvous Approach OBT (Onboard Training), Scott, Paolo & Cady conducted an audio teleconference with ground specialists at ~7:40am EST.  At ~9:10am, the entire crew held their first joint fire drill/OBT (on-board training), a mandatory periodic 70-min exercise (including crew review and subsequent 15-min ground debrief conference at 11:35am) to practice initial crew actions in response to an onboard fire.      [Primary goal of this Russian-led interactive exercise is to maintain crew skills in responding to a fire and to provide the station residents with the most realistic emergency training possible.  The drill is always conducted with the support of all MCCs (TsUP-Moscow, TsUP-Kazakhstan, MCC-Houston, COL-CC, SSIPC/Tsukuba) in close coordination.  It should be performed every 2.5 months, but not later than 1 month prior to end of Increment.  OBT objectives are to (a) practice fire response procedures (FRPs) and all incorporated actions for the case of a software-detected fire to locate, extinguish, and verify extinguishing attempts; (b) browse through RS laptop and the Signal-VM fire detection system displays as well as the automated software (algorithms) response to the fire event; (c) practice crew communication necessary to perform emergency FRPs;  (d) ensure familiarization with support equipment (CSA-CP compound specific analyzer-combustion products, PBAs portable breathing assemblies, PFE/OSP-4 portable fire extinguishers, and IPK-1M gas masks to be used for fire suppression).  These exercises do not actually use any fire equipment but simulate such actions with comm channels, PBAs, CSA-CP and laptop displays to the maximum extent possible.  The Emergency Procedures OBT concluded with a 15-min. debrief with Russian/U.S. ground specialists at ~11:20am via S-band.]  The CDR continued his research work on the CFE (Capillary Flow Experiment) with another session with the VG1 (Vane Gap 1) experiment, first setting up and testing the hardware, including HD (high definition) camcorder, in the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) in the US Lab, then running the fluid operations for ~2 hrs and later tearing the equipment down and putting it back in stowage with MWA and camcorder.      [CFE has applications to the management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.  ICF (Interior Corner Flow) is one of three CFE experiments, the others being Vane Gap (VG) and Contact Line (CL).  Each of the CFE experiments is represented with two unique experimental units (1,2), all of which use similar fluid-injection hardware, have simple and similarly sized test chambers, and rely solely on video for highly quantitative data.  Silicone oil is the fluid used for all the tests, with different viscosities depending on the unit.  Differences between units are primarily fluid properties, wetting conditions, and test cell cross section.]  Oleg & Dmitri spent another ~3h50m on preparations for their Russian EVA-27 on 1/21 and preceding Orlan dry-run, today preparing equipment, studying external working zones (WZ) and off-limit areas, and configuring the SM PkhO (Transfer Module) and DC1 for the spacewalk.  Coleman enabled power to the Node-3 Cupola RWS (Robotics Workstation), and then she and Paolo Nespoli trained for about an hour setting up the DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) and taking the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) through another practice maneuver (misaligned grapple approach) in preparation for HTV2.  Afterwards, Cady disabled the Cupola UOP (Utility Outlet Panel).  Cady also “degassed” a CWC-I (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine, #2002) i.e. to remove any free air bubbles that may have been ingested since its last use.  This has become necessary since the water in the bag is reaching its expiration date and needs to be used.    [The traditional procedure for “degassing” the container by first draining, then refilling it with a fully charged water CWC was replaced in 2004 by a rather ingenious new procedure developed and checked out on the KC-135 aircraft flying zero-G parabolas at JSC/Houston: Essentially, it involves the crewmember himself centrifuging the selected container by holding it away from the body and applying a slow rotation of ~15 rpm to himself, to separate air and water in the bag through centrifugal force, while simultaneously squeezing out the air by cinching down on bungee cords wrapped around the CWC.]  In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Cady serviced the FPEF (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility), exchanging Strobolamps.   Oleg did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).  Dima took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]  Scott Kelly performed periodic maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration.  At ~8:20am, the entire crew assembled in the SM for a Russian PAO TV event, participating in a video conference with the Russian Prime Minister, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.   At ~11:00am, Kelly, Coleman & Nespoli supported a PAO TV event with the Central Florida Aerospace Academy in Lakeland, FL.  FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 & FE-5 had their regular PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Paolo at ~4:35am, Dima at ~10:05am, Oleg at ~12:55pm, Alex at ~2:30pm EST.  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4,).
