Soyuz 55S status:  55S successfully launched yesterday at 11:12:39 GMT.  The vehicle is progressing toward a nominal docking to the ISS tomorrow at 8:07 CDT (13:07 GMT). 
Food Acceptability:  A crewmember completed a Food Acceptability questionnaire today. The Food Acceptability investigation seeks to determine the impact of repetitive consumption of food currently available from the spaceflight food system.  Results will be used in developing strategies to improve food system composition to support crew health and performance on long duration missions. 
Atmosphere Space Interaction Monitor (ASIM): ASIM Low Energy Detectors (LED), also called Cadmium-Zinc-Telluride (CZT) crystals detectors, are not responding as expected in daylight. As part of the on-going ASIM commissioning, science teams requested use of the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) to illuminate the foil covering the detectors and therefore check the response from a known light source.  This afternoon, robotics ground controllers will position and configure the MSS to provide the requested illumination.  During this task, they will also capture pictures of ASIM from different angles to identify/detect any potential damage or contamination to the instrument.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: Today the crew continued configuring EVA tools and equipment needed during the upcoming US EVA #51 Node 2 External Wireless Communications (EWC) planned for June 14th.  They charged GoPro batteries, performed a Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly (REBA) checkout, and reviewed detailed procedures in the EVA Briefing Package.  A procedures conference with ground-based EVA specialists completed today’s EVA activities.
