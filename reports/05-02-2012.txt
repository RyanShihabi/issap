ISS On-Orbit Status 05/02/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After breakfast, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-5 Kuipers conducted an inventory/audit of HRF (Human Research Facility) purple & green supply kits in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) using uplinked itemized tables, to denote quantities of consumables remaining.  He then took situational photography for documentation.      [HRF consumables include such items as gloves, blood tube kits, urine tube kits, blood collection belt, ultrasound echo gel, band aids, biocide wipes, tourniquets, etc.  A resupply activity will be scheduled on a future date to consolidate and replenish any needed consumables within the kits.] Afterwards, André had ~90 min set aside for more ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) cargo operations (unloading & unpacking into stowage) and bag cleaning, i.e., stowing discarded bags and foam packing material in “Edoardo Amaldi”.  FE-5 then tagged up with the ground at ~7:05am EDT for a status report. Using a collimated LED (light-emitting diode) Mini-MagLite beam, FE-6 Pettit conducted a comparison of two samples (Procter & Gamble nos.1 & 2) in the BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) experiment setup, looking for any haze and/or granularity in the backlit samples and taking flash photography with the D2Xs digital camera controlled by EarthKAM software if any was present.        [Interest in the presence/characteristics of possible granularity in the samples derives from the expectation that it reflects aggregation and subsequent coarsening behavior of the colloid dispersions, i.e., the particle-particle interaction originating from depletion forces.] Kononenko performed the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of cooling loop KOB-2, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness). Next, Oleg began a two-day effort to investigate functionality & performance of the Russian POTOK Air Purification System of the SOGS Air Revitalization Subsystem which may have been involved in the loss of RECS (Russian Equipment Control System) power feed from the SM to ATV-3 on 3/30.     [Today’s activity focused on unstowing the necessary equipment, readying the electrical Scopemeter (measuring oscilloscope) by installing batteries, and adjusting proper voltage/current settings on its screen for the subsequent POTOK interference (noise) measurements scheduled on 5/4.] FE-6 Pettit set up the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) equipment in COL in front of the HRF-1 rack and used it for determining his body mass, followed in suit by FE-5 Kuipers.  Afterwards, André powered off, disassembled and temporary stowed SLAMMD hardware including the SLAMMD Accessories Kit.        [SLAMMD, performed first on Expedition 12 in December 2005, provides an accurate means of determining the on-orbit mass of humans spanning the range from the 5th percentile Japanese female to the 95th percentile American male.  The procedure, in accordance with Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion, finds the mass by dividing force, generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer, by acceleration measured with a precise optical instrument that detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing.  The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.  To calculate their mass, crewmembers wrap their legs around a leg support assembly, align the stomach against a belly pad and either rest the head or chin on a head rest.  For calibration, an 18-lbs. mass is used at different lengths from the pivot point, to simulate different mass values.  Crew mass range is from 90 to 240 lbs.] In the US Lab, André accessed the NanoRacks modules and collected data for subsequent transfer to the ER-1 (EXPRESS Rack 1) laptop.     [Initial data transfer issues have been successfully resolved.] After visually inspecting and then activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility earlier in the day (in the evening deactivating it), Don Pettit adjusted the video camera and conducted a session with the BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids) experiment by conducting 3 test points on sample 18, exchanging burner tubes prior to each test point, performing a fan calibration to evaluate the air flow with the new fan flow constrictor installed and exchanging the digital tapes in the MSG VTR1 (Video Tape Recorder 1) & VTR2.        [BASS uses SLICE equipment but burns solid fuel samples instead of gaseous jets.  Each sample will be ignited several times for study.  BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity.  It will also guide strategies for extinguishing accidental fires in micro-G.  Results will contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in space and on Earth.] Oleg took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). The CDR also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Afterwards, Oleg performed another 30-min. session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. In preparation for Soyuz 30S arrival and MRM2 hatch opening (5/17), Don Pettit had ~1.5 hrs allotted to relocate ammonia (NH3) emergency equipment, remove old crew name labels and swap out expired Fresnel lenses from all NH3 respirator kits with new ones.     [New NH3 emergency respirators were labeled with the names of Padalka, Acaba & Revin and moved from the FGB to MRM2, while the respirators of Oleg, André & Don were relocated from MRM1 to FGB.  Fresnel lenses come in two diopter strengths �C 2.00 & 3.00.] Kononenko performed major periodic 3-hr. maintenance in the SM on the ASU toilet facility, changing out replaceable parts with new components, such as a filter insert (F-V), the urine receptacle (MP), the pretreat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pretreat & water dispenser.  Also replaced was the ASU’s air filter.  All discarded parts were prepacked for disposal, and the IMS was updated.     [E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), CrO3 (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H2O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.] Kuipers had another 1.5 hrs for collecting & prepacking cargo for return to earth on the SpaceX Dragon capsule. Afterwards, André spent ~45 min on the continuing preventive inspection & cleaning of accessible AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) system bacteria filters in Node-1, Node-2 and Node-3. At ~2:35pm EDT, FE-5 concluded his 4th (FD135) Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Alternate experiment after exercising on CEVIS to reach 120 bpm heart rate for 10 min, then doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2).    [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] Pettit spent time on reviewing his & André’s procedures for tomorrow’s scheduled IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the CDRA ASV (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly Air Selector Valve, inspecting and cleaning the already removed valve which has been binding when switching between adsorption beds. Before Presleep, Don will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, FE-6 turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~4:05am EDT, CDR Kononenko supported two Russian PAO TV downlinks, extending greetings to (1) Anatoly Dmitrievich Artamonov, governor of the Kaluga region (home of the great scientist Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky), who turns 60 on 5/5, and (2) the International Science & Industrial Forum Great Rivers-2012, hosted by the city of Nizhny Novgorod on 5/15.     [The main theme of the forum, which is being sponsored by UN, UNESCO, World Meteorological Organization, RF Water Resources Agency & Nizhny Novgorod Government, is the sustained development and technologies for the growth, energy conservation, and environmental rejuvenation of great river basins of the world. One of the most important forum topics is international cooperation and joint efforts by the government, businesses, science, and public organizations to develop highly efficient technologies.] At ~8:15am, Kuipers conducted a teleconference with ground specialists to discuss his physical exercise activities. At ~8:30am, André conducted the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with the EAC (European Astronaut Center) near Cologne /Germany. At ~12:05pm, Pettit powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 12:15pm conducted a ham radio session with students at The Mariner's Museum, Newport News, VA. CDR & FE-6 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) scheduled, via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Oleg at ~1:00pm, Don at ~2:40pm EDT. Don Pettit performed a session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video was to be downlinked by Don via MPC.      [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Tasks listed for Kononenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �CA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Yerevan, Armenia (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  Looking left for this capital city of just more than 1 million people.  Visual cues are Mt. Ararat and Lake Sevan.  The city itself lies on a tributary valley of a large green valley floor), West Africa Dust event (DYNAMIC EVENT.    Looking left for a thick dust plume extending into the Atlantic Ocean.  Shooting margins of the dust and continue until a coastline appears [to allow location and orientation of image string]), Lake Faguibine, Mali (during seasonal floods, the Niger River supplies water via a connector channel to the fertile floor of arrow-shaped Lake Faguibine. Today Faguibine is a dry Sahel lake, though probably a permanent water body ~16,000 years ago.  The connector channel and lake floor are the areas of interest.  The connector is often blocked by moving sand dunes, making the lake floor useless as a major local cropland.  Detailed imagery will show the status of the connector and crop health on the lake floor), Valletta, Malta (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  Valletta is at nadir.  The city lies on the protected eastern shore of the island), and Mount Etna, Sicily (Mount Etna lied left of track.  Looking on the northeast tip of Sicily).
