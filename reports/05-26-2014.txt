European Physiology Module (EPM) Rack Reconfiguration: Commander (CDR) Swanson reconfigured the EPM rack in preparation for the Plasma-Kristall 4 investigation planned for Increment 41. He swapped out close-out panels, stowage containers, and CARDIOLAB within the EPM rack.
Remote Power Control Module (RPCM) Trip: Early this morning, RPCM 4B_A RPC #4 tripped. This Remote Power Controller (RPC) feeds the Loop A Early External Thermal Control System (EETCS) pump.  While this pump is plumbed into PVTCS 2B as part of the hybrid configuration due to the PVTCS leak, the pump was not running. The pump has been powered to provide quantity sensor data.  Ground controllers have reviewed the trip data and agree this is a real overcurrent event. There is no immediate impact to cooling as the PVTCS 2B Loop continues to operate nominally in the hybrid configuration.  A Timeliner bundle is currently monitoring 6 sensors on the Loop B leg, two of which come from this pump. With the RPC open the Timeliner will continue to see the last value from the accumulator quantities for the Loop A pump. Since this won’t provide accurate insight to a future leak SPARTAN has inhibited the Timeliner bundle and re-enabled the 2B PFCS FDIR.
Camera Light Pan Tilt Assembly (CLPA) Remove & Replace (R&R) Preparations: Following last Friday night’s operations when ground controllers removed the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Boom B faulty CLPA, today Swanson installed a new CLPA on the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Airlock slide table. Tomorrow the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) will be used to install the CLPA on the SSRMS End-B.
Lamp Housing Assembly (LHA) R&R: Swanson performed two LHA R&Rs, both in Node 1.  Swanson successfully replaced the lamps in the Overhead-Starboard-2 and Port-Deck-2 locations (NOD1OS2 and NOD1PD2). Replacement of these two LHAs returns the Node 1 module to fully operational lighting conditions.
