ISS On-Orbit Status 05/19/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty.   >>>Today the AMS-02 (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer 02) celebrates its First Anniversary of continuous operation on ISS – Congratulations!<<< After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. The six Exp-31 crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP). The CDR also handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-3 Acaba completed his (currently) daily task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire.     [He started this activity after his Soyuz launch and is continuing it on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer), currently with daily logging in the first week, thereafter once weekly.  Neurologists from Leiden University are studying the question whether astronauts in space suffer from headaches.  With the help of a simple questionnaire, André registers the headache episodes and the eventual accompanying symptoms.  The results may help to characterize the frequency and characteristics of space headache and to develop countermeasure to prevent/minimize headache occurrence during the space flight], FE-5 Kuipers conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. FE-1 Padalka serviced the Russian BIO-8 PLAZMIDA biology experiment by removing it in its Rekomb-K hardware from the TBU temperature-controlled incubator (+37 degC) and inserting it into the KRIOGEM-03 cooler (+4 degC). Joe removed his CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) PCMCIA memory card from the SSC laptop where it was formatted for him. FE-6 Pettit filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), his 15th.      [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~8:45am EDT, the entire crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~10:25am, Joe Acaba had his (currently) daily post-arrival PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- & Ku-band audio/video. FE-2 & FE-6 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sergei at ~8:10am, Don at ~2:15pm EDT. The “newcomers” spent some time familiarizing themselves with the onboard exercise equipment, Gennady & Sergei observing Oleg’s workout on the TVIS treadmill, Joe watching Don Pettit on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill and André Kuipers on the ARED and CEVIS machines. The “old” crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6).       [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day. Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic), with CEVIS (aerobic/interval), ARED+T2 (Kinematics), T2 (aerobic/interval), ARED+T2 and CEVIS (interval) following in the next 5 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.    [The new card (31-0005C) lists 9 CWCs (36.4 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (no CWCs);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (2 CWCs with 22.4 L; and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Did you know?   In the last 28 days imagery downlinks via US OCA have averaged 30 GB (Gigabytes)/day.

BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      "Last Friday, we burned a 2-cm diameter PMMA sphere.  Four tests were planned but we were able to complete five in the allotted time.  For the first time in BASS operations we attempted to obtain “wake” ignition, in which the downstream end of the sphere was ignited.  After some effort getting the igniter wire in the best location, Don Pettit was able to progress quickly with the tests.  The flames started out as extremely dim and blue and grew quite slowly.   We explored the very low-speed flow range in the first four tests.  For two of these, the effect of gaseous nitrogen was examined.  The nitrogen weakened the flame but was unable to put it out even at the highest nitrogen flow rate setting.  In the last test, the flow speed was increased to 20 cm/s.  The small, dim blue flame transitioned to a long, sooty flame, and it spread steadily toward the stagnation point of the sphere.  Turning the flow off put the flame out in all cases.  Images are still being processed. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

We hope that you enjoyed being the first ENERGY test subject, and we look forward to hearing your feedback about the implementation of this experiment. Your and Don's urine samples and water samples are currently foreseen to be returned with SpX-1.  The ground teams were glad to hear that you liked the special menu!  Don, we appreciate very much your participation as control subject. The acquired data will be extremely valuable for the science team to be able to quantify the amount of Double Labeled Water that will be recycled in US system.”      [Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
