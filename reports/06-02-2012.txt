ISS On-Orbit Status 06/02/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty. After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. The six Exp-31 crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg, Gennady & Sergei completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2), Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), and the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem. FE-2 Revin also handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-6 Pettit conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Kononenko, with Padalka attending for “knowledge handover”, completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~4:55pm EDT.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 5/14 & 5/15).] FE-3 Acaba sequentially initiated and monitored charging of four Makita batteries for use with the Cardiopres blood pressure device during the next 24-hr ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session. Don Pettit closed the protective shutters of the JAXA Kibo laboratory window to avoid its heating during the upcoming high Beta angle regime.       [Shutter closure should be verified 12 hrs (as a margin) before the Betas reach more than +60 deg.] Acaba & Pettit filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Joe’s 2nd, Don’s 17th.        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~8:00am EDT, the entire crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. FE-3 & FE-5 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), André at ~9:40am, Joe at ~2:10pm EDT. Don had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-1).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic/continuous), with CEVIS (aerobic/interval), ARED+CEVIS (VO2max), T2 (aerobic/interval), ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic/continuous) and CEVIS (aerobic/interval) following in the next 5 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Tasks listed for Kononenko, Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop (Oleg+Gennady),·        A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central Eastern Atlantic Ocean, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop (Sergei), and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb) (all).

ALTEA SHIELD (NASA/ASI):     “Dear André, since you are going to set up the ALTEA SHIELD Shielding experiment in Columbus in the coming week, please find some more background information in the following.      [Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):      No report.

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     On 5/29 to 5/31 quarterly maintenance test activities for BIOLAB were performed.  “Thank you, André, for your support on 5/29 by opening the O2 and the CO2 gas bottles and checking the gas supply valves.  A Life Support Module (LSM) tightness test was performed to check the tubes between the LSM and the Experiment Containers.  Unfortunately, due to a LSM software anomaly and bad Ku coverage, the scheduled functional checkout of the LSM was postponed and needs to be rescheduled.  On 5/30 files were successfully updated for the scheduled Handling Mechanism (HM) Gripper tests (force and positioning tests).  Unfortunately, there was an issue with one of the axis of the HM Gripper Arm.  The p-axis could not be initialized and the tests were aborted. These tests also need to be re-planned.  On 5/31 the BLB Rotor Alignment tests for rotor A and B were successfully completed without any issues.” BIORHYTHMS (JAXA, Biological Rhythms):     No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
