ISS On-Orbit Status 08/21/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off duty.   At wake-up, Fyodor Yurchikhin performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]   Upon wake-up, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson finished her 4-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 4th onboard run, with the final controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  Photo documentation was part of the activity.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]   For FE-6 Walker, it was the 3rd day of her 4-day Pro K controlled diet & diet logging session, after the urine pH spot test, her third onboard run.   Before her sleeptime, Shannon will set up the equipment for her next 24-hour urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood & urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]  For Douglas Wheelock, it was the 2nd day of his 3rd session with the Pro K protocol after the urine pH spot test.   Caldwell-Dyson, Wheelock & Walker continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy & Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 3rd for Doug & Shannon, 7th for Tracy, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]   Additionally, Shannon completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.    [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]   The six station residents completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]   FE-3 Kornienko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   Walker, Wheelock & Caldwell-Dyson filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]   At ~9:00am EDT, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.   On TsUP Go, Misha Kornienko was to repressurize the ISS cabin atmosphere with N2 (nitrogen) from Progress M-06M/38P’s SrPK air supply tankage to make up total pressure.    CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4 & FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Tracy at ~6:25am, Alex at ~7:45am, Mikhail at ~8:15am, Shannon at ~2:00 pm, Doug at ~3:30pm EDT.   Jobs listed for Skvortsov & Kornienko today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –  Another run of the GFI-8 "Uragan"      (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D2X digital camera      photography with 800mm telelens (FE-3) for large      glaciers of South Patagonia ice field (left of flight path) as targets,      and A session for Russia's EKON Environmental      Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of      environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera (CDR/FE-3).    The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]  Weekly Science Update (Expedition Twenty-Four -- Week 11)   2-D NANO Template (JAXA):     The experiment was started on 7/9.   3-D SPACE:    No report.

Thank you for your diligent efforts at CEO in the midst of all your EVA’s!  Your handsome portrait of NASA’s JSC and the surrounding Clear Lake area was published on GSFC’s Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  NASA centers are a favorite target of both Shuttle and ISS crews, but your detailed view acquired under cloudless skies on the afternoon of 7/31 is the best JSC photo that we have seen recently.  Kudos to the crew!”   CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were South African fires (this is the burning season in tropical Africa.  Angola is known as the country in which natural and set fires are the most prevalent in the world.  Looking right of track, from near nadir to well off track to document fires and smoke palls.  Fires and smoke should have been visible for ~4 mins from this start time.  Combined with oblique look angles, present conditions of lower illumination can help to reveal smoke in the atmosphere.  Including any recognizable features [such as lakes, and areas with less smoke] so that the locations of ISS CEO images can be determined.  Astronaut images of fires and smoke have been used in published scientific studies of global biomass burning), Harare, Zimbabwe (looking just left of track for this capital city.  Harare is relatively simple to locate.  The long geological feature known as the Great Dyke is a prominent, dark linear that extends for hundreds of km.  Reservoirs that supply Harare with water have been constructed against the hills of Great Dyke: these reservoirs are the next visual cues), and Santiago, Chile (the city lied immediately north of track and contrasts with the surrounding agricultural landscape.  Prior astronaut images show significant expansion of the city southward towards the Rio Maipo, and elsewhere, in the 15 years between the images).
