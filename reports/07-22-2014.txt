Conjunction with Object #38925 Status: Ground teams evaluated tracking data throughout the day for a possible conjunction with Object #38925. Because tracking on the object was inconsistent ground teams began planning for a Debris Avoidance Maneuver (DAM). Time of Closest Approach (TCA) for the object is tomorrow at 8:16 am CDT. Unless the tracking data changes significantly overnight, the DAM will be initiated at 5:56am CDT tomorrow morning.  In order to protect the 56 Progress (56P) 4-orbit rendezvous the DAM will be performed retrograde.
Ocular Health: Commander (CDR) Swanson completed his Flight Day (FD) 120 Ocular Health vision test and FE-6 Gerst completed his FD 60 Ocular Health vision test. With Gerst as operator, Swanson used Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to measure retinal thickness, volume, and retinal nerve fiber layer. Then with assistance from FE-5 Wiseman, Gerst completed his OCT. Swanson and Gerst alternately used the fundoscope to obtain images of the retinal surface. The Ocular Health protocol calls for a systematic gathering of physiological data to characterize the risk of microgravity-induced visual impairment/intracranial pressure in ISS crewmembers. Researchers believe that the measurement of visual, vascular and central nervous system changes over the course of this experiment and during the subsequent post-flight recovery will assist in the development of countermeasures, clinical monitoring strategies, and clinical practice guidelines.
Sprint Ultrasound: With assistance from Gerst, Swanson took Sprint ultrasound data for his FD 120 ultrasound Sprint session. Sprint evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise training to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in International Space Station (ISS) crewmembers during long-duration missions. Ultrasound scans are on FD 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and R-7 for mission duration of six months and are used to evaluate spaceflight-induced changes in the muscle volume.
Binary Colloidal Alloy Test (BCAT)-Low Gravity Phase Kinetics Platform (KP) Sample Installation: Wiseman transferred images from the BCAT-KP investigation at the conclusion of the current run, then uninstalled BCAT-KP in preparation for the installation of BCAT-Canada 1 (C1) tomorrow. BCAT-KP provides a platform for material and industrial scientists to investigate colloid phase changes, providing results that may be used to develop new colloidal materials and formulations with unique properties. The results may support new applications, from new liquid crystals to consumer goods having longer shelf life and uses.
Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS)-II Operations: Wiseman conducted flame tests for the BASS-II investigation. This investigation examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity. The experiment will guide strategies for materials flammability screening for use in spacecraft as well as provide valuable data on solid fuel burning behavior in microgravity. BASS-II results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth.
Combustion Integration Rack (CIR) Fuel Oxidizer Management Assembly (FOMA) Calibration: Swanson closed valves in the CIR in preparation for the ground to conduct the CIR FOMA calibration. After the ground operations were concluded, Swanson re-opened the valves and closed the CIR rack. This calibration is needed for the yearly recertification of the CIR. Tomorrow, Swanson will Remove and Replace (R&R) two CIR igniters, which will allow ground teams to continue FLame Extinguishment Experiment  (FLEX)-2 operations.
Circadian Rhythms: Wiseman completed his 36-hour data collection and removed the Circadian Rhythms hardware. The main objective of the experiment is to get a better basic understanding of any alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights. This data will provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest- and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions.
Crew Medical Officer (CMO) On-Board Training (OBT): Gerst performed a session of this OBT which is a Computer Based Training (CBT) module. It requires no ground interaction and is performed periodically to maintain proficiency for designated CMOs.
