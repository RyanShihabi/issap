Advanced Colloids Experiment (ACE)-M-2 Sample Mixing: Commander (CDR) Swanson mixed ACE-M-2 samples in preparation for sample analysis which will take place in the Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR) at a later date. In the ACE-M-2 investigation, a model colloidal system is used to observe the microscopic behavior of liquids and gases separating from each other, near the critical point, via a process called spinodal decomposition.
In Flight Maintenance (IFM): Swanson performed a Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) flush tank fill and depressurized the flush water tank and water valve block to protect the dose pump.
Public Affairs Office (PAO) Event: Swanson participated in a PAO event with middle and high school students. Topics included research being conducted on the ISS and what types of tasks are performed during space walks.
