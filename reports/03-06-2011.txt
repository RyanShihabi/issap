03-06-2011March 06, 2011ISS On-Orbit Status 03/06/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday –  FD11 (Flight Day 11) of STS-133/ULF-5.    Ahead:  Week 16 of Increment 26.    .   Sleep cycle shift:  Crew wake/sleep cycle continues to shift, returning to “normal” on 3/8.Current schedule for ISS crew (EST): DateWAKESLEEP3/63:23am6:53pm3/73:23am4:33pm3/81:00am4:30pm First thing in the morning, prior to eating, drinking, and brushing teeth, FE-6 Cady Coleman collected her final liquid saliva sample of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol.    Subsequently, Cady also completed the blood sample collection for the IMMUNE protocol, assisted by FE-5 Nespoli as operator/CMO (Crew Medical Officer).       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] FE-2 Skripochka completed his 5th monthly session with the Russian biomedical MBI-15 "Pilot-M"/NEURO signal response experiment, assisted in the 3h 30m session by Alex Kaleri.  Later, the Pilot-M & Neurolab-2000M gear was disassembled & stowed away, data files were downloaded, and Oleg reported to TsUP-Moscow on his run.        [MBI-15 requires the Multipurpose Hardware Bench as a table, ankle restraint system, eyeball electrodes for an EOG (electrooculogram), and two hand controllers (RUO & RUD) for testing piloting skill in “flying” simulations on a laptop (RSK1) with software (v. 2.0) under stopwatch control, as well as for studying special features of the psychophysiologic response of cosmonauts to the effects of stress factors in flight.] Paolo Nespoli had ~90 min set aside for the periodic audit/inventory & photo documentation of controlled medications (injectable & oral) in the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack) & AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack ) medical kits, including discarding expired medications and replacing them with new ULF5 deliveries.      [The audit was assisted by uplinked tabular material and in DEA compliance.] Cady Coleman unpacked IMAK (ISS Medical Accessory Kit) cargo delivered on STS-133 with resupplies for AMP Pallet 2 and an ARED tool.  Cady also discarded remaining medical items for Shannon Walker & Doug Wheelock.  Scott Kelly & Steve Lindsey ended the N2 (nitrogen) transfer from the Shuttle to the ISS HPTs (High-Pressure Tanks) and tore down the transfer equipment.    [A total of ~26 lbs N2 was transferred.] Paolo & Steve L. also dismantled & removed the O2 (oxygen) supply line that was used to pipe O2 from the Shuttle to the ISS tanks.      [An estimated total of ~117 lbs O2 was transferred until this morning, plus 51 lbs of ISS metabolic support (given that Elektron remains off.]. FE-6 Coleman performed routine service on the WRS (Water Recovery System), using the LFTP (Low Flow Transfer Pump) to transfer Shuttle condensate to the ISS WPA (Water Processor Assembly) for processing.     [Estimated offload time: 4 hrs.] Later, Cady offloaded the WPA storage tank from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary port to a CWC-I (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine) bag.  The PWD  could not be used during the offloading.      [Estimated offload time: 23 min.] FE-6 also filled out her weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Paolo Nespoli performed regular maintenance calibration on the two new hand-held CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units, #1046 &b #1059. Scott Kelly later applied specially-made labels to the CSA-O2 instruments indicating expected O2 levels in the open cabin air (19,7%-23.2% - both units to agree within 1.1%) and behind closeouts (17.4%-23.3%, one unit only). In the SM (Service Module), FE-4 Kondratyev performed the daily monitoring of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment which is taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle docked phase.  The data were later copied from the BUSD Control & Data Gathering Unit to a USB-D-M-3 stick for downlink to the ground.  The BUSD archive was then deleted and the DAKON-M restarted.       [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.] CDR Kelly finished up with yesterday’s maintenance work on the OGS (Oxygen Generation System) in Node-3, removing the temporary filters, prepping them for stowage and closing up the A5 bay by rotating the rack to re-install the side access panel.      [The activity was intended to provide pre- and post-filtration samples and pressure data for developing a long-term remediation configuration to remedy the low pH issue of the recirculation loop which limits the OGS running time.  Because the delta-pressure sensor in the water pump assembly is failed, pump current is being adjusted from the ground to keep maximum delta-pressure below maximum value. ]  The alignment guides on the T2/COLBERT treadmill rack in Node-3, which had to be installed for the OGS work, were then removed by Kelly to allow use of the exercise device. After setting up the Spinal TAP (Tracking Anthropometric Posture Assembly) and other equipment assemblies of the Spinal Elongation experiment hardware on the Shuttle Commander’s seat, Scott collected spinal elongation (seated height) data from FE-5 Nespoli.  Paolo then took over as Operator to take measurements of Scott and Cady.       [Since the object was spine elongation in zero-G, the measurements were timelined such that they were not within an hour of compression exercise/countermeasures.  Data logging and documentary photography of the equipment setup and the subjects in the seat were part of the activities, followed by transfer of the camera card to laptop for downlink.]  Kaleri conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers]. Alex also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for reporting to TsUP. After reviewing refresher notes on DCB (Double Cold Bag) handling, Kelly & Coleman had 2.5 hrs reserved for the critical packing of science specimens for return on Flight ULF5.      [Scott & Cady prepared five DCBs with Ice Bricks and samples removed from MELFI- 3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) and MELFI-1, then stored them on the Shuttle middeck.  Time critical due to a 124-hr hold constraint.] At ~5:45am EST, Kaleri, Kondratyev & Skripochka joined in a Russian PAO TV downlink, transmitting messages and greetings to three events:  (1) The 38th International Public Science Readings in Gagarin, (2) congratulations to S.F. Mohov on his 60th birthday, and (3) to participants of a multimedia space exhibition being set up by RIA Novosti News Agency in France.         [(1)  Between March 9 & 12, 2011, the City of Gagarin will be hosting the 38th Public Science Readings in memory of Y. A. Gagarin  (“….Best wishes to the people of the hometown of the first cosmonaut in the universe – every success in your endeavors and creative work for the benefit of motherland and the Gagarin’s birthplace, health and happiness to every one of you!”).   (2)  At end of March Major General Sergey Fedorovich Mohov will turn 60.  For many years, Mohov was responsible for the operation of Russian ground sites holding the position of RF Space Force Deputy Commander  (“…You led the team in the implementation of manned space programs, both domestic and international. You supervised launches of 12 manned and 17 cargo ships as well as over 40 special purpose vehicles. You completed over 200,000 control session of which almost 9,000 were with Piloted Orbital Complexes.  In this memorial year for the national cosmonautics we would like to wish you and your family cosmic health and prosperity, further successes and forward movement.  Russia has always been, is, and will be a great space power.”)  (3)  To the Novosti multimedia space exhibition in France: “…On behalf of the International Space Station crew I would like to welcome you to the grand opening of the exhibition in memory of the first human space flight.  “Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot remain in the cradle forever" – this famous quote belongs to Konstantin Eduardovich Tsiolkovsky.  On April 12, 1961, space science created a miracle by accomplishing a seemingly unreachable dream of human travel to the stars.  Yuri Gagarin’s space flight overturned all existing ideas about human limits and capabilities.  This event became a starting point for a new era in our history, the first human step into space.  The new reality was so incredible it was hard to believe.  And for quite a while now we have been watching as cosmonauts and astronauts from Russia, USA, European Space Agency, Canada, Japan, and other countries work together as a team on orbit at an altitude of 300 kilometers above Earth.  Our joint work on orbit has demonstrated that representatives of different countries and nations may live and work together in peace for the benefit of the entire humanity reaching new pinnacles of achievements.  I believe the exhibited photographs will tell you more about Yuri Gagarin and how he prepared for his space flight, about USSR space programs, and the current state of cosmonautics”).] In preparation for the upcoming Shuttle departure, Cady Coleman closed the external window shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) as protection during the depressurization and leak checking of the ODS (Orbiter Docking System) vestibule between PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 2) and Discovery.   FE-6 also set up the HD video camera equipment for covering the subsequent departure activities for live PAO downlink. Later today, at ~3:33pm EST, the ISS and Discovery crews will congregate for the traditional Farewell ceremony, on live NASA TV.   Shuttle/ISS airduct disassembly and hatch closing will then follow at ~3:48pm.   Undocking of Discovery from PMA-2 is scheduled tomorrow morning at 7:03am, after a total docked time of 8d 16h 49min.  Landing at KSC is expected on 3/9 (Wednesday), at ~11:58am.    The ISS crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1/2x, FE-2/2x, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).        [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is done regularly after the last T2 session of the day.] Utilities Update: Lab CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) running nominally on heater string 1 this morning; transition to heater string 2 later today for a 24-hr checkout;Node-3 CDRA went down due to a recurrence of a spontaneous controller reboot; ut was recovered an hour later.OGA (Oxygen Generator Assembly) remediation procedure completed.    [OGA set points were adjusted due to high pump cautions and delta-pressure concern.  Flow test results indicate sufficient flow to perform remediation but insufficient flow to leave the hardware installed permanently];Vozdukh CO2 scrubber system is up and running nominally since insulation removal;Elektron O2 generator is currently deactivated; experts are analyzing the data.   [If the problem is the software then a software patch, currently in development, will be uplinked.]Russian ASU toilet is operating in automated mode, at present without issues. Conjunction Preview:     NASA has received preliminary data on a possible conjunction with Object #14694 (Westar 6 Rocket Body/Pam-D) on 3/9 (Wednesday).  TCA (Time of Closest Approach):  6:59am EST.  This will be reassessed for ISS after undocking perturbations have been tracked out.   Not expected to affect Shuttle, based upon planned post-undock state vector.  If DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) required, the ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) is prime candidate for the propulsive evasion. Mission Timeline Look-Ahead:Mar 7 (FD 12) Undock (7:03am), flyaround, late inspection, OBSS berth Mar 8 (FD 13) Orbiter FCS checkout, RCS hot fire, cabin stowageMar 9 (FD 14) Deorbit and Landing (nominal landing). No CEO targets uplinked for today.
