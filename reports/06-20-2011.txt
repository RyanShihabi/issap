ISS On-Orbit Status 06/20/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway: Week 14 of Increment 27/28. ATV Adieu:   At 10:46am EDT, ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) “Johannes Kepler” undocked from the ISS SM (Service Module) aft port and 60 sec later performed its departure boost, with Aleksandr Samokutyayev & Sergei Volkov standing by to monitor separation maneuvers and telemetry parameters as Andrey Borisenko, as planned, recorded imagery of the ATV front cone during departure.  ATV2 performed nominal separation burns and is scheduled for re-entry tomorrow after the last of two deorbit maneuvers at ~4:05pm for burn-up in the atmosphere and ocean impact of surviving parts (~4:52pm). CDR Borisenko, FE-1 Samokutyayev & FE-4 Volkov supported the undocking and separation of “Johannes Kepler” by –Activating & verifying proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during undocking; later, Andrey downloaded the stored measurements;  [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises],Setting up, activating & testing the KL-152 “Klest” television equipment in the SM with the ATV TV control console (BRTK-PU)   [with Ku-band downlink via OCA of the MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) “streaming video” packets, which MCC-Houston then passed on to the ESA Gateway for COL-CC (Columbus Control Center) to forward the downlink to TsUP-Moscow],Taking video and photography of the ATV forward cone at separation (~10:46am), i.e., focusing the Nikon D2X still camera at SM window #26 especially on the two TGM (Telegoniometer) sensor boxes and two VDM (Videometer) sensor boxes in front,Monitoring the fly-away from an SM window for situational awareness and safety,On TsUP Go, switching the PrK-to-aft port vestibule PEV (Pressure Equalization Valve, KVD) manually to its Closed position, andObserving proximity operations of the ATV from any aft window as “Johannes Kepler” ventured out on its independent flight phase prior to reentry.  Also preparatory to the undocking, FE-3 Ron Garan closed the external shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows as protection against contamination from ATV thruster effluents, while FE-6 Mike Fossum powered down the ham/amateur radio equipment until later in the day. After ATV departure, FE-1 Samokutyayev had an hour set aside for uninstalling and removing the ATV PU control panel in the SM. FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum undertook their 2nd weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done in Mondays.       [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]  Led by CDR Borisenko, the 27S crew of Volkov, Furukawa & Fossum performed the regular 2h15m Emergency Egress Readiness Drill for Increment 28, followed by a debriefing with the ground.      [This is a standard training exercise conducted to familiarize new crewmembers with the location of emergency equipment (including hatches & passageways), focusing particularly on the passage along the emergency evacuation route.  It includes checking out the position of valves used in emergencies in all ISS modules, an inspection of each hatch for drag-throughs and an audit of all cable cutters and flashlights at the hatches, plus a review of crew interactions in emergencies.  The concluding debrief included a crew report on mechanical obstructions in open hatchways, location of all ammonia respirator kits, and Node-3 fire ports with obstructions.] FE-3 Garan retrieved three CWCs (Contingency Water Containers), two from PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module, F2_Aft, #1095 & #1098) and one from Node-2 (loc. O2, #1084) and restowed them in Node-2 (Fwd Endcone) to facilitate their retrieval for future activities. Before breakfast, Furukawa began a new round of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the 26S crew, i.e., Borisenko (#1011), Samokutyayev (#1012) & Garan (#1013) for a 24 hrs data take. Afterwards, Satoshi initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer) and deactivated the system ~5 hrs later.       [This was the first session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1001, after the previous instrument (#1004) was used for 37 runs after it had replaced the earlier instrument, #1002, which was used for approximately 7 sessions.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware. Furukawa also concluded his first (FD14) 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~1:10pm EDT).   Data download from all devices to the HRF (Human Research Function) PC1 laptop will be scheduled later.     [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] Later, Satoshi performed periodic maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), inspecting the exercise rope knot for fraying or damage in rope or rope strands.     [Knot can be loosened as needed to aid in the inspection.  Areas of concern are those with the tightest diameters (i.e. sections of rope contacting the French Clip).  If damage is found, FE-5 was to photo document it and notify MCC-Houston.] Working in the US A/L (Airlock), Garan & Fossum had ~3 hrs reserved for resizing the two prime EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units), to be worn by them during the ULF7 EVA, followed by a checkout of the REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery) hardware.       [EMU #3010 was reconfigured for Mike, EMU #3009 for Ron.  Installation of the light assemblies with EMU TV was done during the REBA checkout period, to be followed later, prior to the EVA Dry Run, by installation of the Fresnel lenses, Valsalva nose tweezers and comm caps.  Also to be installed: EMU batteries and METOX canisters.]  Samokutyayev set up the Russian TEKh-38 VETEROK (“Breeze”) science hardware and then used it to take air ion concentration measurements three times during the day at a number of locations in the MRM1 Rassvet module.  Data were taken in two blocks of 1h 15m each with a break of ~2 hrs in between and entered on log sheets.      [Objective: to optimize atmospheric gas parameters in MRM1 by operating the Veterok air-cleaning fan for 1.5 hrs without generation of air ions, then for another 1.5 hrs with generation of air ions.  Veterok uses an air scrubber fan (VOV), air ion concentration meter (IKAR-1) and anemometer-thermometer (TAN-1) for measuring charged particles at various locations near the running VOV.  The experiment studies the implementation of alternative methods for cleaning & revitalizing the atmosphere by pumping the air with an electrostatic fan through an electric filter and saturating the airflow with light air ions of positive and negative polarity, which may solve the problem of removing organic trace contaminants from the air, both in the entire station volume and in the space behind the panels.  Measurements were taken with IKAR-1 and TAN-1 of particle field polarity (plus/minus), concentration, temperature & velocity and downloaded to the RSE-1 laptop.] After configuring STTS communication systems temporarily for crew presence in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, Borisenko conducted another active session with the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), supported by ground specialist tagup.  STTS was then reconfigured to nominal.  Andrey later set up the two SONY HVR-Z1J video camcorders for replaying and downlinking their recorded footage during two RGS (Russian Groundsite) passes, at 7:36am-7:54am and at 12:13pm-12:37pm EDT.        [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS: condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.] Aleksandr took the periodic Russian PZE-MO-3 test for physical fitness evaluation, his first, spending ~90 min on the T2 advanced treadmill in unmotorized (manual control) mode and wearing the Kardiokassette KK-2000 belt with three chest electrodes.       [The fitness test, controlled from the RSE-Med laptop, yields ECG (electrocardiogram) readings to the KK-2000 data storage device, later downlinked via the Regul (BSR-TM) payload telemetry channel.  Before the run, the KK-2000 was synchronized with the computer date/time readings.  For the ECG, the crewmember rests for 5 min., then works out on the treadmill, first walking 3 min. up to 3.5 km/h, then running at a slow pace of 5-6 km/h for 2 min, at moderate pace of 6.5 km/h for 2 min, followed by the maximum pace not exceeding 10 km/h for 1 min, then walking again at gradually decreasing pace to 3.5 km/h]. Satoshi Furukawa & Mike Fossum spent about an hour with Ron Garan in a handover session, their 2nd, during which Ron familiarized his crewmates with USOS (US Segment) activities. 27S crewmembers Volkov, Fossum & Furukawa again had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. FE-1 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sasha also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Before “Presleep” period tonight, Garan will power on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Before sleeptime, Andrey will start battery charging for the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware for another run tomorrow.     [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-4). No CEO targets uplinked for today.
