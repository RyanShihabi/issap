Skin-B Sample Collection: Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Gerst conducted his second Skin-B data collection using the Tewameter probe to measure the skin barrier function; the Visioscan Camera to measure skin surface topography; and the Corneometer probe to measure skin hydration. The Skin-B experiment will improve understanding of skin aging, which is slow on Earth but very much accelerated in space. This will also provide insights into the aging process in other (similar) bodily tissues in general. The data could help in determining impact on astronauts on future missions to the Moon and Mars for example where environmental conditions are more challenging. 
Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS)-II Operations: FE-6 Gerst conducted three flame tests for the BASS-II investigation. Gerst burned a 2cm wide, flat, cotton-fiberglass blend fabric and one rod with Japanese wax with a stagnated flow. The fabric samples ignited at the lower oxygen level, but extinguished quickly. The candle ignited and ground teams reduced the air flow until the flame extinguished, providing flame shape data. The BASS-II investigation examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity. The BASS-II experiment will guide strategies for materials flammability screening for use in spacecraft as well as provide valuable data on solid fuel burning behavior in microgravity. BASS-II results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth. 
Glacier-4 Hardware Installation: Commander (CDR) Swanson installed Glacier-4 into Express Rack (ER)-7. This Glacier unit was delivered to the ISS on SpX-3.
Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Zero Robotics: FE-5 Wiseman and FE-2 Artemyev set up the SPHERES satellite hardware with the ER laptop and loaded specific test session software. The crew monitored the SPHERES satellites during the test sessions. This unit test session is in preparation for the Zero Robotics competition with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) later this summer. This SPHERES session was planned in conjunction with a Russian crew member as part of a joint utilization agreement. The SPHERES Zero Robotics investigation establishes an opportunity for high school students to design research for the ISS. As part of a competition, students write algorithms for the SPHERES satellites to accomplish tasks relevant to future space missions. The algorithms are tested by the SPHERES team and the best designs are selected for the competition to operate the SPHERES satellites on board the ISS.
American to Russian Converter Unit [CHT] Testing:  Swanson and FE-1 Skvortsov conducted testing of the Russian Electrical Power System (EPS) to gather data on issues seen with [CHT] operations.  The tests being performed today and tomorrow will characterize the current flow between the Service Module power bus and several downstream loads.  Additional tests are planned after new hardware arrives on Orb-2 and will focus directly on the [CHT]s.
Internal Thermal Control System (ITCS) Sample Collection: Swanson obtained  ITCS fluid samples from the Lab, Node 2, Columbus and Japanese Experiment Module (JEM).  The Ammonia, Ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), and pH samples will be returned to the ground for analysis.
Robotics Operations: Tonite the robotics ground controllers will complete the relocation of Pump Module (PM) Flight Releasable Attachment Mechanism (FRAM) from External Stowage Platform (ESP)-3 to ESP-2.  This positions the FRAM for planned summer Extravehicular Activities (EVAs).
