ISS On-Orbit Status 09/25/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – crew rest day.  Sleep: 1:35am EDT this morning; Wake: 2:00am tomorrow morning.   Yest posadka!  (We have Landing!)    Welcome back home, Tracy, Alex and Mikhail!   After 177 days 1 hr 19 min in space (175d 23h 58m docked to ISS), Soyuz TMA-18/22S, carrying Exp-24 crewmembers Alexander Skvortsov (Russia), Mikhail Kornienko (Russia) and Tracy Caldwell-Dyson (USA), landed successfully at 1:23am EDT this morning (local time: 11:23am) in central Kazakhstan near the city of Arkalyk (51.01N, 66.57E).  The crew was in excellent condition.  The descent capsule remained upright.  The return was delayed one day due to a problem with docking hooks on the ISS side (see yesterday’s report).   [TMA-18 (#228) undocked from the MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2) Poisk port last night at 10:02pm, after the crew had performed leak checks of the vestibule area between the SM and the Soyuz spacecraft, of their Sokol suits and of the hatch between the Descent Module (SA) and Orbital Module (BO).   Three minutes after physical undocking, Soyuz performed a 15 sec separation burn.    The actual de-orbit burn of 4 min 17 sec duration came at 12:31:17am, resulting in a 115.2 m/sec deceleration.  Tri-module separation occurred at 10:56:10am.  16 sec after the separation command, software pitched the Instrumentation/Propulsion Module (PAO) in the rear to a specific angle (-78.5 deg from reference axis) which, if the PAO would have remained connected to the SA/Descent Module, would have resulted in enough heating on the connecting truss to melt it, thus ensuring separation.  Atmospheric entry followed at 12:59:12am and nominal parachute deployment at 1:07:42am.  Following initial observation by Russian SAR (Search & Recovery) personnel, the Soyuz vehicle landed at 1:23am.  The crew was flown by helicopter to Karaganda where Tracy “TC” Caldwell-Dyson boarded the waiting NASA Gulfstream-III airplane which today is bringing the crewmember back to Houston (with 2 refueling stops),- the second direct return for USOS crewmembers.  Sasha Skvortsov & Misha Kornienko meanwhile were flown on the GCTC Tu-154 back to Chkalovsky airfield of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center at Zvesdniy Gorodok (Star City).]     Remaining on board for Increment 25 are CDR Douglas Wheelock (USA), FE-5 Fyodor Yurchikhin (Russia) & FE-6 Shannon Walker (USA).  They are having a free day today, getting back on regular wake/sleep cycle tomorrow (Sunday, 9/26).   Tasks currently listed on the crew’s “job jar” job roster are – For Wheels & Shannon:  MARES (Muscle Atrophy      Resistive Exercise System) hardware stowing  [MARES is currently in      need of troubleshooting due to a power issue], Operational Products      review   [a periodic assessment by the crew (after about 1 month into      their stay) of their ops products such as Daily Summary, Execute Notes,      One Time Use Notes & Stowage Notes) in order to suggest improvements      if required], WHC (Waste & Hygiene      Compartment) KTO/Solid Waste Container replacement, WHC EDV-U/Urine Container      replacement;  For Fyodor:  Another Uragan (hurricane)      earth observation/photography session.

CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), MDCA/Flex:    “On 9/16, two test points from the science matrix were successfully performed.  Test points were performed with heptane fuel at a 0.7 atm chamber environment of 17% O2, 45% CO2, and 38% N2:  •  Test #1 - Droplet diameter of 3.5 mm, with no support fiber. Good deployment and ignition; ignited but quickly extinguished as expected for this test condition.  •  Test #2 - Droplet diameter of 4 mm, with no support fiber. Small bubble in droplet; ignited but quickly extinguished as expected for this test condition.  In addition to these test points, the CIR team performed several operations to assess the characteristics of the contamination on the fiber, needles and igniter tips.  We attempted to scrape the fiber contamination with the needle, which had minimal effect and no success in removing the hair.  We then dispensed fuel and let it sit on the needle.  The fuel seemed to soften the contamination, which appears to be at least slightly soluble in the heptane.  After the fuel evaporated, the igniters were used to heat the contamination.  This was successful in significantly reducing the amount of visible contamination, including elimination of the hair. No flames were observed during the heating process.  The CIR team plans to conduct one additional set of heptane test points with the remaining fuel in the reservoir.  Further test point operations are on-hold until a better understanding on the contamination is developed and an appropriate response can be implemented.”  Commercial Photo (JAXA):   No report.

One of your views of a part of the striking landscape of the Es Safa Volcanic Field located to the southeast of Damascus, Syria was published on NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  This is an excellent documentary view of features and processes of this large volcanic field.  In addition, your heads up view of the Twitchell Canyon Fire, central Utah on GMT Day 263 was posted the next day on the Natural Hazards page of Earth Observatory. Your image proved superior in detail and content to other satellite imagery acquired and submitted at that time.  Thanks for your prompt download of this dynamic event photography.  Kudos to the crew!”   CEO photo targets uplinked for today were Kilauea Volcano, HI (ISS had a near nadir-viewing pass over Kilauea Volcano.

The volcano was located slightly to the left of track), Tbilisi, Georgia (weather was predicted to be clear over this capital city.  Tbilisi is located in the southern Caucasus region on the banks of the Kura River.  Overlapping mapping frames of urban and surrounding rural area were requested), Astana, Kazakhstan (looking to the left of track for this capital city.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural area were requested), and Typhoon Malakas, western Pacific (Dynamic Event.
