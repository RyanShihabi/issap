ISS On-Orbit Status 10/22/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Underway: Week 5 of Increment 33 (three/six-person crew). After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Malenchenko also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 & RSS2 laptops. Additionally, FE-4 conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. CDR Williams & FE-6 Hoshide started the day with another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, Suni’s 32nd, Aki’s 33rd.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] In Node-3, Sunita completed routine maintenance on the WRS (Water Recovery System), taking water samples for analysis in the TOCA, after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose with water from the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) and buffer solution from the BC.      [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Afterwards, the CDR deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.    [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] Williams also conducted another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.      [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] Later, Suni took air samples with new GSCs (Grab Sample Containers) in the center of SM, Lab, and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), sequenced with the AQM sampling for postflight comparison.    [GSC samples are to be taken 1-3 hrs after AQM start.] Malenchenko completed the periodic (every Monday) verification of the automatic IUS AntiVirus definition update on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2, as well as the manual update on the non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.     [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the SSCV4 software update.  Before the installation (on 8/8/11) of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Later, Yuri conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~5:10pm EDT.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days (last time: 10/2 & 10/3.] FE-4 also had ~2.5 hrs to conduct functional closure tests, prepared for and started yesterday, on the stowed regular BVK vacuum valves of the SOA Vozdukh CO2 (carbon dioxide) removal system using the MMTs-01 Elektronika Multimeter from the Vozdukh PK SOA control panel ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) in the SM panel 421 area. In COL, Hoshide partially configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware with power, data, front panel, and gas connections plus MBS (Mixing Bag System) for his 4th session with the Sprint VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, scheduled tomorrow.        [The experiment Sprint VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  Sprint VO2max is a test that measures oxygen uptake, ventilatory threshold, and other physiological parameters for evaluation of Sprint exercise prescription. The in-flight exercise protocol consists of multiple stages.  Both the VO2max and Sprint experiments require monthly max tests in-flight, but each use a different protocol to obtain the data.  Joint VO2max/Sprint subjects use the VO2max protocol.  Suni is performing the VO2max protocol, Aki the Sprint Max protocol.  Suni is the last VO2max subject.  Aki is the first Sprint subject not also participating in VO2max.  The Sprint protocol requires less Portable PFS accessory hardware than the VO2max protocol. However, for consistency, both crew will complete the full hardware setup.] Afterwards, Akihiko transferred the measurement data of the periodic acoustic survey taken on 10/16 in the ISS by the CDR with the SLM (Sound Level Meter) to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for subsequent downlink.    [The SLM data transfer performed on 10/16 was re-done today because not all files were downloaded during the data transfer.]  In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), loc. A1, Aki removed the desiccant packs from the MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2) Dewar 2 in preparation for rack activation.    [Desiccant bags and humidity indicators were trashed in a bag in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) Endcone. MELFI-2 was activated later in the day to maintain the 1-fault-tolerant backup capacity for cold stowage samples.] Also in Kibo, Suni later worked on MELFI-1 (loc. D4), removing the failed EU (Electronic Unit) from the “spare” location, installing a blind panel over the empty location and packing the EU for return on Dragon.    [At this time, there is no spare EU available onboard to install in the empty location.  The freezer’s Brayton machine was powered down temporarily by POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center/Huntsville) for the removal and panel installation.] Malenchenko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Yuri also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Later, FE-4 had another 1h45m reserved for continuing the ongoing cargo transfers to the Progress M-16M/48P ship for stowage and disposal.      [Since 48P is scheduled to remain docked to the station until February next year, it serves as a temporary stowage location for selected cargo items, all of which must be documented in the IMS (Inventory Management System) database.  Disposal cargo is also being stowed as per uplinked listing.] Hoshide supported the WRS (Water Recovery System) by cleaning stowed CWC-Is (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine) for use, if required.    [Ground teams have analyzed the photographs of mildew on two CWC-Is in PMM in the proximity of a leaky CWC (#2041). This type of growth has been generally classified as Haz-1, posing minimal risk to health or ISS hardware. In order to minimize the potential spreading of spores, the ground recommended to double-bag the CWC-Is while leaving the QDs (quick disconnects) exposed. The water can still be utilized and will be transferred to the Waste Bus using the condensate pump. Once empty, the bagged CWC-I will be trashed.] Afterwards, Aki performed the (currently almost daily) service of the WRS (Water Recovery System), using the Russian pumping equipment to initiate the periodic water transfer from a degassed CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodinated) to the WPA WST (Water Processor Assembly Water Storage Tank) via “tee” hose and a freshly installed MRF (Microbial Removal Filter) cartridge as gas trap.  The MRF was left connected for future operations.     Working on the ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2), Williams used zip ties to secure one of the snubber pins (bottom left) to prevent its backing out over time due to vibrational loading. Yuri Malenchenko had another 30-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of South-Eastern Pacific Ocean, using the SKPF-U Photo Image Coordinate Reference System with HD video camera and then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. After familiarizing himself with the new JAXA RT/Resist Tubule experiment (Mechanisms of Gravity Resistance in Plants – From Signal Transformation & Transduction to Response) with written material and a video, Hoshide conducted a demo run of the payload’s KFT (KSC Fixation Tube) operation.    [Aki used KFT #FAM001 with Glutaraldehyde Formaldehyde fixative (S/N FAM001).] Later, FE-6 performed regular maintenance calibration on the sensors of the two CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units 1047 & 1055.     [During last week’s CSA-O2 calibration, one of the units could not be calibrated, leaving one in calibration.  It is believed the calibration issue was a result of either a poor seal or too short of a purge during the calibration.  Today’s recalibration should have remedied the situation.] Suni & Aki joined up for a 3-hr review of preliminary EVA-20 objectives, procedures and requirements, including study of the on-orbit QD (quick disconnect) trainer for a refresher course on FQDs (Fluid QDs) carrying NH3 (Ammonia) coolant.      [EVA-20 will focus on the 2B power channel and the ammonia leak in the P6 truss. The data shows the leak in the loop has accelerated, and that channel could be off-line by the end of the year if the leak trend continues. Objectives of the 6h30m spacewalk on 11/1 include EAS (Early Ammonia System) jumper reconfigurations, demating the FQDC (Flight Quick Disconnect Coupling) of the 2B PVR (Photovoltaic Radiator), removal & stowage of the TTCR shroud, plus release & deployment of TTCR, with photography and contingency time.] In support of the upcoming spacewalk, Suni used the D2Xs digital camera to take overlapping pictures of the PVTCS (Photovoltaic Module Thermal Control System) 2B radiator hardware from the forward window of the Kibo JPM. At ~1:00pm, the CDR is scheduled for the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists. Before Presleep (~3:40pm), Sunita will power up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6).      [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed ARED/CEVIS (cont.), with T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (VO2max), and T2 (int., 4 min.) for the next 3 days.  Aki’s protocol for today showed T2 (int., 30 sec.), with ARED/CEVIS (VO2max), and T2 (int., 4 min.) on the following 2 days.] After his SPRINT workout on the T2 machine, Aki will close down the treadmill software on its laptop for data transfer, then turn off the T2 display.     [After the display shutdown, the T2 rack is power cycled (turned off/on) from the ground, and T2 is then ready for use.  These power cycles allow for the T2 data to be transferred to the Server for downlink.]  Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andA ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) to record target sites on the Earth surface.
