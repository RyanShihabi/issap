ISS On-Orbit Status 10/28/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. At wakeup, CDR Fossum checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera & flashlight battery charge and later in the day performed additional checks on the payload, looking for crystals, changing camera battery, downloading images and restarting the Intervalometer for automated flash photography.  The SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM software is not being used for this run.      [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking a photo of the turbid Sample 1 every hour.  While Sample 1 is running, crystal checks on Samples 6-10 will be performed each day.  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.] At or after ~2:17am EDT, Mike Fossum concluded his 3rd NUTRITION w/Repository 24-hr urine collection period, with samples deposited in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).  Additionally, Mike underwent the associated generic blood draw, with Satoshi Furukawa assisting with the phlebotomy as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  FE-5 then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the JPM MELFI.      [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.] In preparation of Progress M-13M/45P (#413) docking at the DC1 (Docking Compartment) nadir port on 11/2 (next Wednesday, ~7:40am EDT), FE-4 Volkov & FE-5 Furukawa worked through the standard 3-hr refresher training for the TORU teleoperator system, which provides a manual backup mode to the Progress’ KURS automated rendezvous radar system.  A tagup with a TORU instructor at TsUP/Moscow via S-band audio supported the training.  Before the session, Sergey swapped the RUD (translation) & RUO (rotation) hand controllers for his Pilot mode; afterwards, he returned them to nominal mode.       [Satoshi has been approved for providing support to Sergey in monitoring automatic approach & final approach, reporting monitored parameters to Sergey who sets up, tests and executes TORU.  The drill included procedure review, rendezvous, docking data and rendezvous math modeling data review, fly-around, final approach, docking and off-nominal situations (e.g., video or comm loss).  Three different flight conditions were simulated on the RSK1 laptop.  The TORU teleoperator control system lets a SM-based crewmember perform the approach and docking of automated Progress vehicles in case of KURS failure.  During spacecraft approach, TORU is in “hot standby” mode.  Receiving a video image of the approaching ISS, as seen from a Progress-mounted docking television camera (“Klest”), on a color monitor (“Simvol-Ts”, i.e. “symbol center”) which also displays an overlay of rendezvous data from the onboard digital computer, the crewmember would steer the Progress to mechanical contact by means of two hand controllers, one for rotation (RUO), the other for translation (RUD), on adjustable armrests.  The controller-generated commands are transmitted from the SM's TORU control panel to the Progress via VHF radio.  In addition to the Simvol-Ts color monitor, range, range rate (approach velocity) and relative angular position data are displayed on the “Klest-M” video monitor (VKU) which starts picking up signals from Progress when it is still approximately 9 km away.  TORU is monitored in real time from TsUP over RGS (Russian Ground Sites) and via Ku-band from Houston, but its control cannot be taken over from the ground.   On 11/2, Progress KURS-A (active) will be activated at 6:06am EDT on Daily Orbit 1 (DO1), SM KURS-P (passive) two minutes later.  VHF (UKV-2d) and Progress video will be switched on at a range of ~9 km, the same as Progress floodlight.  Progress TORU will be activated from the ground at 3 km range.  Flyaround to the SM aft port (~400 m range, in sunlight) starts at 7:18am, followed by station keeping at 170m at ~7:25am.  Start of final approach: ~7:30am (DO2) in sunlight, contact at DC1 nadir port: ~7:40am.  SM Kurs-P is deactivated on mechanical capture.  Sunset: ~7:46am.] Fossum completed another manual fill of the WRS WSTA (Water Recovery System / Waste Storage Tank Assembly) from a Russian EDV-U urine container for processing through the UPA ARFTA (Urine Processor Assembly / Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly). In Node-3, Mike afterwards opened the HV01 valve to initiate MCA (Major Constituents Analyzer) vacuum pumpout.  The pumpout valve will be closed again about 4 hrs later.      [This is a second go at it.  Yesterday the Node-3 MCA experienced a problem during start-up that caused an advisory (“MCA Vent Valve Indeterminate”) and a caution ("MCA Configuration Fault").  MCA specialists believe the issue may be related to a timing error between software commanding of the vacuum vent valve and the actual valve position.  Today’s attempt to resolve the problem consisted of overriding the software.  Evaluation is underway.]  Furukawa performed a status check and reboot on the MDLT (Medical Laptop), checking for possible display freezing (in which case he was to power-cycle the laptop). FE-5 also had ~45 min. set aside to inspect and clean the RGSH (Return Grid Sensor Housing) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) in its Port Cone/Deck side location.      [The RGSH had to be opened to gain access to the internal sensors and brackets using the vacuum cleaner.] Furukawa & Fossum filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Later, Satoshi & Mike conducted the 8th onboard JAXA HAIR experiment, both collecting hair samples from each other, then inserting them into MELFI-1, Dewar 1/Tray A at -95 degC and closing out the activity. FE-4 Volkov finished up preparations for Progress M-10M/42P (#410) undocking tomorrow morning (~5:01am EDT), by –Downlinking the formal report on stowage completion to TsUP/Moscow, Activating the spacecraft’s electronics and taking out the ventilation/heating air duct;Removing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking & internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) which rigidized the joint,Closing the transfer hatches; Conducting the standard one-hour leak checking of the SU docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress & DC1, andDownlinking the video depicting the close-out activities, for review by ground specialists.   [During hatch closure, leak checking and initial clamp installation, Russian thrusters as usual were inhibited due to load constraints (10:00am-11:40am).] In preparation for the 42P undocking, Furukawa powered down the amateur/ham radio station in the SM, and Fossum closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows. Sergey completed the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO2 (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit.       [The AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO2 during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP).] Servicing the MSL (Materials Science Laboratory) in the Lab MSRR (Material Science Research Rack), Fossum removed the SCA (Sample Cartridge Assembly) data cable and installed a termination plug in its place, as required for a furnace health check, the next recovery step for MSL.       [The termination plug simulates SCA electrically, thus enabling furnace heater activation from the ground.  Once functionality and correctness of temperature sensor readings are verified by the health check, engineers will develop a cleaning procedure for the furnace.  Due to spatial constraints, the nearby CEVIS exercise device, with seat moved back, could not be used during today’s MSSR activity, which was video-recorded via G1 camcorder for MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) downlink.  Also, Mike had to move the EHS TEPC (Environmental Health Systems / Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly temporarily off the Lab O3 rack to prevent interference.  Afterwards, CEVIS was reconfigured and TEPC returned to O3.] Before Presleep, Satoshi will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, FE-5 will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~3:40am EDT, Sergey linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~4:25am, the three crewmembers held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~7:20am, Mike powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 7:25am conducted a ham radio session with the Space Laboratory at the Herzliya Science Centre, Herzliya, Israel. At ~11:35am, the CDR conducted his regular IMS (Inventory Management System) stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists. At ~3:10pm, the crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-4, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5).  Earlier, Satoshi set up the video camera in Node-3 to cover the workout sessions of himself & Sergey on the ARED, to meet the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.      [CDR Mike Fossum is currently following a special experimental “SPRINT” protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5hrs per day regime and introduces special daily sessions.  No exercise will be timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Mike picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),The daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules;  [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)],Taking care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur),The daily routine servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM;  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator], andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Ganges River Delta (weather was predicted to be relatively clear with a few popcorn cumuli over the Ganges Delta at the time of the ISS overpass, however there might have been some haze present.  Looking to the left of track for the multitude of river channels forming the Mouths of the Ganges.  Vegetation in the delta area includes mangrove forest which tends to appear darker than the upland vegetation.  Overlapping mapping frames of the current channels and shorelines of the delta were requested), Moroni, Comoros (the capital city of the island nation of Comoros is located on the largest island in the northwestern part of the archipelago at the north end of the Mozambique Channel.  On this pass as ISS tracked northeastward off the Mozambique coast, the crew was to look just right of track for small city of 60,000 situated on the west coast of the island, using the long lens to capture the urban area in a single frame), Asmara, Eritrea (Asmara is the capital city of Eritrea.  ISS approach was from the SW with fair weather expected.  The city is located on the northwestern edge of the Great Rift Valley and the Eritrean highlands.  Looking near nadir and try for overlapping mapping frames of the city.  Because it is such a low-contrast feature, CEO staff suggested that the crew start mapping photography as ISS approached the target, continuing as it passed over it), Santiago, Chile (weather was predicted to be clear over the capital city of Chile.  Context imagery with 180 mm lens of the urban area provide useful context for higher resolution photographs), and Popocatepetl Volcano, Mexico (Mexico's second highest peak [17,802 feet] is a large, active volcano located 43 miles southeast of Mexico City.  Mapping frames of the volcano and flanks were requested to capture current summit glacier extent and cone geomorphology).
