Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Slosh:
Kelly configured two SPHERES satellites and coordinated with ground controllers to observe the dominance of fluid forces during higher accelerations. The investigation uses small robotic satellites to examine how liquids move inside containers in microgravity. A water bottle’s contents slosh around differently in space than on Earth, but the physics of liquid motion in microgravity are not well understood which affects computer simulations of liquid rocket fuel behavior. University undergraduate and graduate students control the SPHERES to study how liquids behave inside containers in space, which increases the safety and efficiency of future rockets.
