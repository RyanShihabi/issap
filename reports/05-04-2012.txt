ISS On-Orbit Status 05/04/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Upon wakeup, FE-5 André Kuipers & FE-6 Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, their 38th.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] After breakfast, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Pettit configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware plus MBS (Mixing Bag System) in COL, including calibrating the PPFS software and checking instruments, and then conducted his 5th session with the VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, integrated with Thermolab (head sensors).  After the session, Don powered down, cleaned up & partially stows the equipment, then downloaded the data to a PCS laptop.       [The experiment VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.] Later, Don supported the ground in on-going SpaceX checkouts of the Dragon CUCU (COTS UHF Communication Unit) by activating the CUCU from ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2), plugging in the CCP (Crew Command Panel) and routing it from the Lab to the Cupola in Node-3.  After checking it out, FE-6 stowed the CCP overnight and turned off ER-2 power feed to CUCU. Kononenko completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Oleg also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Later, the CDR performed standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in the MRM1 Rassvet, downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of this morning’s ATV-3 reboost to a laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] André Kuipers downloaded the accumulated data from his recent 4th (FD135) 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session (5/1-5/2) from two Actiwatch Spectrums and two HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1).  The laptop was then powered off.      [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] Other activities completed by André included �C・        Preparing Node-2 for Dragon arrival by unlatching the nadir port hatch, setting the latch to its hard stop position,・        Unstowing and setting up the KUBIK-3 temperature-controlled cooler in the ESA COL near the EDR (European Drawer Rack) in stand-alone configuration, connecting it to EDR for power and then checking power bus status of KUBIK-3 & KUBIK-6, later disconnecting & stowing KUBIK-3,・        Starting another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later;  [consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],・        Completing his weekly task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire   [which he started after his Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space.  Neurologists from Leiden University are studying the question whether astronauts in space suffer from headaches.  With the help of a simple questionnaire, André registers the headache episodes and the eventual accompanying symptoms.  The results may help to characterize the frequency and characteristics of space headache and to develop countermeasure to prevent/minimize headache occurrence during the space flight],・        Accessing the NanoRacks modules in the Lab and collecting data for subsequent transfer to the ER-1 (EXPRESS Rack 1) laptop, then powering off at the NanoRacks locker location and stowing the ER power cable,・        Filling out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), his 14th;    [on the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily],・        Opening the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows after this morning’s ATV reboost, and・        Performing maintenance on the BLB Glovebox (BGB) to remove its gloves and replace it with new ones.Oleg Kononenko meanwhile had ~3.5 hrs for continuing the investigation of functionality & performance of the Russian POTOK Air Purification System of the SOGS Air Revitalization Subsystem which may have been involved in the 3/30 loss of RECS (Russian Equipment Control System) power feed from the SM to ATV-3.       [Today’s activity focused on taking POTOK interference (noise) measurements using the electrical Scopemeter (measuring oscilloscope).  ESA meanwhile has performed testing on the RECS1 RICU (Interface Control Unit) which converts signals and transfers data between the analog RECS data busses and the digital ATV 1553 bus, and has found it to be failed.  ATV is currently operating on RECS2 which it has been on since the initial RECS1 failure.]  Before Presleep, FE-5 will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, André turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~4:20am EDT, Kononenko, Kuipers & Pettit held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~4:35am, Oleg linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~10:15am, André & Don tagged up with ground specialists to discuss Bose headphone issues.    [Malfunctioning headphones will be replaced by new ones manifested on Soyuz 31S, Progress 48P, SpaceX-1 and Orbital.] At ~11:55am, FE-5 & FE-6 supported a PAO TV session, responding to interviews with Fox News Radio (Eben Brown) and CBS News (Peter King, Bill Harwood). At ~12:40pm, Don conducted the regular IMS stowage tagup with Houston stowage specialists. André Kuipers performed a session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video was to be downlinked by André via MPC.      [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Tasks listed for Kononenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C・        RSE1 & RSE-Med laptop system disk maintenance (cleaning up for nominal Symantec Antivirus operation and conducting C-drive defragmentation as necessary), ・        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and・        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).WRM Update:     A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.   [The new card (31-0005A lists 13 CWCs (101.0 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (1 empty CWC);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (5 CWCs with 87.0 L; and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] ISS/ATV Reboost:  A one-burn reboost of the ISS with the ATV-3 OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters was performed this morning as planned at 4:37am EDT with a burn duration of 20 min 21 sec, achieving a delta-V of 3.0 m/s (planned: 3.0 m/s), increasing mean altitude by 5.26 km (planned: 5.3 km).  After the burn, ISS was at 399.46 km mean altitude, with 401.13 km apogee height and 397.80 km perigee height.  Purpose of the reboost was to set up phasing for Soyuz 30S launch. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Volga and Ural River Deltas, north Caspian Sea (looking left for these deltas on the north coast of the Caspian Sea.  Overlapping mapping frames of channels and wetlands in these adjoining deltas are of particular interest), Mt. Etna, Sicily (looking right for this volcano on the northeast tip of Sicily.  Mount Etna is currently classified as having new activity.  Recently Mt. Etna has been going through a small eruptive phase whereby ash plumes have been observed to occur as frequently as every 5�C15 minutes.  Trying to capture the source and extent of any plume.  A second opportunity to image Mt. Etna came later in low sun, which may have given dramatic views), Central Cuba (the crew was to shoot mapping strips [overlapping images] along track for baseline, context views of land use in central Cuba.  Researchers at Florida International University are conducting an analysis of land cover change, indicated by changes in vegetation [especially vegetation clearing[, industrial and residential land use, etc.), Volcan Colima, Mexico (looking left for this massive, 3,850-meter volcanic complex in southwestern Mexico, located between the coastline and Lake Chapala.  CEO database has numerous photos of this target, but cloud-free, long-lens views of the twin-peaked summit area have eluded crews to date), and Monaco, Monaco (nadir pass.  Looking on the coastline for a broad promontory.  The port facilities and even the red roofs of the city stand out).
