ISS On-Orbit Status 11/03/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – Crew off duty. After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 & RSS2 laptops. Working as a team, the six crewmembers conducted the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including all USOS (US Orbit Segment) modules like Lab, Nodes, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg Novitskiy, Yuri Malenchenko & Evgeny Tarelkin also completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), the grilles of the SKV air conditioner in the SM and the Russian VKS (Auxiliary Computer System) laptops. In the US Lab, FE-3 Ford used the vacuum cleaner on the vents of the T61p OpsLAN Servers LS1 & ISS-SERVER1 in bay O1, to ensure optimal performance. Kevin also performed the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.     [Crew report: “Screens a little dirty, but not bad.  All cleaned up and running nominally.”] In the MRM2 Poisk module, Yuri continued the current twice-daily (morning/evening) checking of vacuum/pressure conditions in the Plasma Chamber of the Russian KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall-3 plus) Telescience payload for upcoming operations.       [The PK-3+ equipment comprises the EB (Eksperimental’nyj Blok) Experiment Module with a turbopump for evacuation, Ts laptop, video monitor, vacuum hoses, electrical circuitry, four hard storage disks for video, and one USB stick with the control application.] Akihiko Hoshide prepared the equipment for taking measurements for the JAXA BLR48 (Biological Rhythms 48/BIORHYTHMS) experiment and then started the session with a wrist-worn Actiwatch Spectrum (#9001) with BLR48 software and the medical laptop. Sunita Williams will begin her BLR48 measurements next Saturday (11/10).      [First, Aki uses Holter 1 for data recording, then swaps it with Holter 2, Multi Media memory card and fresh AAA battery after 24 hrs (and 10 min after power-up) for another 24 hrs. Objective of this study for Aki & Suni is to examine the circadian variation of astronaut’s digital electrocardiograph during space flights using the cardiac autonomic function of the “Digital Walk Holter ECG” with its electrodes attached to the chest and the wrist-worn Actiwatch Spectrum activity monitor to supplement circadian rhythms data. For Aki only, the objective is also the long-term ODK2 (Onboard Diagnostic Kit 2) evaluation of a remote healthcare system’s operability and accuracy with the collected data, in order to develop a computerized remote healthcare system for astronauts.] Oleg serviced the BTKh-14 BIOEMULSIYA payload, transferring the Rekomb-K bioreactor from the TBU incubator (+37 degC) in the DC1 (panel 403) back to the TBU-V incubator (+4 degC) in MRM1 (panel 102), with Evgeny shooting documentary photo/video. Evgeny later also moved the BTKh-6, 7 ARIL/OChB biotech science payloads from the KRIOGEM-03 thermostat-controlled container (+29 degC) to the +4 degC TBU-V.    [“Aryl” is an abbreviation commonly used to represent any group of organic molecules which form an aromatic ring. OChB refers to research into bioactive germ cultures producing the yeast SOD (superoxide dismutase).] FE-1 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] On TsUP Go, Yuri Malenchenko was to perform a total pressure repress of the ISS cabin atmosphere with air from Progress M-17M/49P SRPK tankage. Aki Hoshide, Suni Williams & Kevin Ford filled out their standard FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop Terminal).  It was the 14th time for CDR & FE-6, the first time for FE-3.      [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]  Kevin broke out and set up the equipment for his first Nutrition/Repository/Pro K generic urine collections which start tomorrow morning for their 24-hour run. Samples will be secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS). At ~7:20am, Oleg, Evgeny & Yuri powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and conducted a ham radio session with Kursk University students at the city of Kursk.     [Some intelligent questions posed to the crew:  What holidays do you observe during your mission? Does other crewmembers’ citizenship affect that? What traditions are connected to that, what national features, something maybe introduced by cosmonauts?  Do young people want to work in space industry: in GCTC (Star City), MCC, space industry companies? In your opinion how to attract them there?  After the mission do you cognize differently social life on Earth, problems of the state and nature, etc. Do you change your opinion about it?  Do you often communicate with youth festivals participants?  What characteristics are the most important for young people in your view?  Do cosmonauts and astronauts from different countries continue fellowship after joint missions?  Do different expeditions’ crews have events for their joint meetings?   After the first mission is over, does the next mission seem scarier or more fascinating?  Do you think of yourselves more as scientists now that you engage in scientific experiments – or workers, performers? Space is often a workplace of international crews. Do you think it is of practical or token value? Do you believe that joint space operations promote cooperation of different nations?  Were the skills you mastered when preparing for the mission of any use to you when you returned to Earth? Can certain elements of your training program be recommended for ordinary school and college students? What elements of mission training would you include into the school curriculum?] At ~9:15am, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. CDR, FE-2 & FE-4 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Evgeny at ~8:30am, Yuri at ~11:15am, Suni at ~4:05pm EDT. At ~1:10pm, the three Russian Flight Engineers supported a PAO TV event with Moscow, downlinking congratulations to two anniversaries.    [(1) the Regional Public Foundation of Heroes of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation named after General E.N. Kocheshkova on its 15th Anniversary since its establishment, celebrating on 11/17 in the Red Hall of the Cultural Center of the Armed Forces, and (2) the 70th Anniversary of the formation of the special forces in the Far East for monitoring and supporting manned and unmanned spacecraft.] The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).     [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today shows ARED/T2 (continuous), with T2 (interval, 2 min.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 4 min/Kinem.), ARED/T2 (cont.), and T2 (int., 30s) for the next 5 days. Aki’s protocol for today shows T2 (int. 2 min), with ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), and T2 (int., 4 min.) on the following 4 days.] Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Shooting a video for the Roskosmos TV studio in its joint production with Channel Russia 24 for the weekly program “Space”,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andA ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) to record target sites on the Earth surface. WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (32-0005G) lists 14 CWCs (178.3 L total), including 1 empty bag, for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (3 CWCs with 98.1 L);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L);  3. Iodinated water (5 CWCs with 54.55 L); 4. Waste water (1 CWC with 9.68 L bag EMU waste water), and 5. Special Fluid (OGS) (1 CWC with 2.5 L). Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-Three – Week 6) 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ACE-1 (Advanced Colloids Experiment 1, NASA):  ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD Shielding (NASA/ASI):    To date, the session#2 has progressed nominally, with 82 cumulative days (of minimal 40 / preferred 60 days, no maximum acquisition duration) of science acquisition. The science team has formally confirmed the validity of the session#2 data. Though the preferred amount of data acquisition is reached, it is planned to continue measuring until the storage of ALTEA SHIELD. Further data collection is expected to support statistical analyses later on.        [Background: Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):   No report.

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BCAT-C1 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test C1, CSA):    No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report. EPM (European Physiology Module):    No report.
