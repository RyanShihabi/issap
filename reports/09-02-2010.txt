ISS On-Orbit Status 09/02/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  With the Russian Elektron O2 generator running again, FE-5 Yurchikhin performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Elektron which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 will inspect the filters again before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Upon wake-up, FE-6 Walker completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]  FE-6 Shannon Walker & FE-4 Doug Wheelock are on Day 5 of Session 1 of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment, i.e., low-salt diet for Wheels, high-salt for Shannon.  Besides the daily diet monitoring/logging, today’s activities also involved taking blood samples for PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) analysis and preservation in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) as well as starting 24-hr urine collections.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Wheels & Shannon are ingesting special diet (for Wheels: Session 1 – Low salt diet; Session 2 – High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level; for Shannon: first High salt, then Low salt).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]  Yurchikhin continued the current round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the FGB to clean the TsV1 fan and interior panel grills.  CDR Skvortsov joined in, inspecting & cleaning “Group B1” ventilator fans & grilles in the SM (Service Module) with the vacuum cleaner.  Alex Skvortsov set up pumping equipment with the electric compressor (#41), replacing the usual A-R transfer hose with a T2PrU air line, and started the standard bladder compression and leak check of the BV1 Rodnik water storage tank of Progress M-05M/37P, to get it ready for urine transfer.  Flush water was to be transferred to an EDV or caught in a towel.  37P is docked at the DC1 Docking Compartment.      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]  FE-3 Kornienko took the periodic Russian PZE-MO-3 test for physical fitness evaluation, spending an hour on the TVIS treadmill in unmotorized (manual control) mode and wearing the Kardiokassette KK-2000 belt with three chest electrodes.     [The fitness test, controlled from the RSE-Med laptop, yields ECG (electrocardiogram) readings to the KK-2000 data storage device, later downlinked via the Regul (BSR-TM) payload telemetry channel.  Before the run, the KK-2000 was synchronized with the computer date/time readings.  For the ECG, the crewmember rests for 5 min., then works out on the treadmill, first walking 3 min. up to 3.5 km/h, then running at a slow pace of 5-6 km/h for 2 min, at moderate pace of 6.5 km/h for 2 min, followed by the maximum pace not exceeding 10 km/h for 1 min, then walking again at gradually decreasing pace to 3.5 km/h].  In the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezer which FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson installed the yesterday at an ER (EXPRESS Rack), FE-4 Wheelock today replaced the desiccant pack left by Tracy in the container with a new one when it failed to dry the Glacier (possibly due to saturation).    [GLACIER units are ultra-cold freezers that store samples as low as -185 degrees C.  The GLACIER, designed and originally manufactured by the University of Alabama in Birmingham (UAB), provides a double middeck locker-sized ER-compatible freezer/refrigerator for a variety of experiments that require temperatures ranging from +4 degC (39 degF) to -185 degC (-301 degF).  GLACIER is part of the Cold Stowage Fleet of hardware which includes the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker/Incubator).]  Wheelock continued his support of the MI (Marangoni Inside) payload troubleshooting on the FPEF (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility) in JAXA’s JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).  As a result of his inventory/audit on 8/31 which indicated that one MI cassette is missing, Doug today conducted a search for the missing item – which he then located in its designated CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag).      [Downlink: “I suspect that maybe it was just overlooked during the inventory search a couple of days ago.]  Afterwards, Wheels supported Part 2 of the hyperextension tests on the FIR/ARIS (Fluid Integrated Rack / Active Rack Isolation System) pushrod/actuators.   More work tomorrow.      [Steps included standing by for each ground-commanded “hyperextension” test on the ARIS actuators, then re-adjusting the snubbers after each test.  For this, Doug had to remove/install the FIR alignment guides several times, to allow microgravity during the test and to protect the ARIS during each subsequent power-down.  Background:  Designed to attenuate external vibration disturbances of payload racks, ARIS is quite different from traditional shock absorbers by working with active feedback control.  This is done with accelerometers to measure vibration disturbances, an electronic unit to process the data, eight actuators with pushrods for applying compensatory (counteracting) forces against the framework of the station in response to signals from the electronic unit that are calculated to "counteract" the disturbances measured by the accelerometers, and microgravity rack barriers (“snubbers”) that prevent accidental disturbance of the active ARIS rack.  Before regular operation, ARIS is checked out and calibrated in order to fine-tune the multiple-component system.  The standard ground-commanded hyperextension test cycles the eight pushrod/actuators through their full range of motion until the rack motion is stopped by the snubbers, to verify that its motion does not over-extend.]   Afterwards, Douglas undertook his 2nd session with the JAXA experiment BIORHYTHMS (Biological Rhythms), for which he put on the electrodes of the DWH (Digital Walk Holter) for ECG (Electrocardiogram) recording, then started the data take for the next 24 hrs.    [BIORHYTHMS is performed by Walker & Wheelock, with 3 data collection sessions for each of them.  Body mass is measured with SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device).  Each session collects 24 hrs worth of ECG data.  On Day 1, the Holter ECG harness is donned for recording.  On Day 2, it is removed, and the ECG data are downloaded to the MLT (Microgravity Laptop terminal).]  Fyodor did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).  FE-3 Kornienko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]  Caldwell-Dyson had ~2h15m set aside to collect surface samples in the Lab using the Microbiology SSK (Surface Sampling Kit).  Later, she also used the MAS (Microbial Air Sampler) kit to take the periodic microbiology (bacterial & fungal) air samples from two specific sampling locations in the SM, Node-1, Lab and Node-3 as well as mid-module in JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      [After a 5-day incubation period, the air & surface samples will be subjected on 9/7 by Shannon Walker to visual analysis & data recording with the surface slides and Petri dishes of the MAS & SSK.]  Tracy then took IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) flow measurements for specific locations between modules in Node-3 (to Lab), Airlock (to Node-1 IMV), and RS (to Node-3 IMV).     [Measurements were collected with the electronic Velocicalc instrument at Lab IMV Aft Port outlet, Node-1 linear diffusers, and Node-3 Ovhd (Overhead) Port Diffusers.]   Afterwards, FE-2 also took Velocicalc air flow readings for the JAXA JPM module.    [Data were obtained at the Ovhd Aft IMV Inlet, Stbd Aft IMV Inlet & Stbd Fwd IMV Outlet.]  After setting up the LFTP (Low Flow Transfer Pump), Doug Wheelock offloaded condensate water from a CWC (Contingency Water Container, #1066) to the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly Waste Water Tank) for processing.     [The operation took ~4h 15m.]  Next, in Node-3 Wheelock replaced the LHA (Lamp Housing Assembly) at loc. AO2 (Stbd) with a spare, and Walker later replaced a second LHA (loc. FD2/Stbd).  In the Lab, FE-4 re-installed the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides (3) on the FCF (Fluids & Combustion Facility) in the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to protect the rack from external loading events (dynamic disturbances).  Wheels also completed the weekly 10-min. CWC inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (24-0007I) lists 122 CWCs (2,854.0 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (25 CWCs with 1,042.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. /12.7 L in 17 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 44.0 L in 1 bag still requiring sample analysis, 128.3 L in 3 bags for flushing only with microbial filter, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only; 2. potable water (5 CWCs with 215.4 L, of which 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 1 bag with 42.5 L are to be used with microbial filter & 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use;  3. iodinated water (84 CWCs with 1,550.1 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (24.1 L, in 1 bag with 6.3 L to be used only for OGA, 1 bag with 17.8 L for WPA WWT processing plus 8 empty bags; and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (1 CWC with 20.2 L from hose/pump flush & 1 bag with 1.38 L from EMU dump).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]  For the ARED advanced resistive exerciser, Doug disconnected its main power cable from its PS-120 junction box and reconnected it directly to UOP4 (Utility Outlet Panel 4, port 3).  Fyodor completed periodic routine maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, changing out replaceable parts with new components, such as a filter insert (F-V), the urine receptacle (MP), the pretreat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pretreat & water dispenser.  Also replaced was the ASU’s air filter.  All old parts were trashed in Progress 37P, and the IMS was updated.     [E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), CrO3 (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H2O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.]  Mikhail had another ~2h30m reserved for shooting more “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7 #2 high-definition camcorder as part of the ongoing effort to create a photo & video imagery database on the flight of ISS-24 (“Flight Chronicles”).     [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.]  Misha also set up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) experiment at SM window #9 for another sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with a coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloading the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.  Photography began at ~7:44am EDT (over Africa) with a picture every 10 sec.     [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.]  After yesterday’s ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) coolant refill in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Shannon today drained & purged the FSS (Fluid Servicer System) and FSS jumpers, then removed and stowed the equipment.  At ~10:00am, the crew convened for their standard bi-weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office (Steve Lindsey), via S-band S/G-2 audio & phone patch.  At ~10:40am, Walker, Caldwell-Dyson & Wheelock joined in a PAO TV downlink, participating in two media interviews – one with KXTV-TV Sacramento, CA (Nick Monacelli), the other with Fox News Radio (Todd Starnes).  At ~3:10pm, the crew is scheduled for the regular weekly teleconference with ISS Program Management at JSC/Houston via Ku-band/video & S-band/audio.  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR/2x, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-4, FE-6).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is regularly being done after the last T2 session of the day.]  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Typhoon Kompasu, Korean Peninsula (Dynamic Event.  Looking to the left of track as ISS approached the Korean Peninsula for Typhoon Kompasu.  The storm approached the Seoul metropolis at the time of ISS overflight.  Imagery of cloud banding and an eye [if present] are useful for documenting the storm immediately after landfall), Victoria, Seychelles (weather was predicted to be mostly clear over the capital city of the Seychelles.  Victoria is located on the northeastern side of the largest island of Mahe.  Nadir-viewing context views of the city and island were requested), Lake Nasser, Toshka Lakes, Egypt (looking to the right of track for the Toshka Lakes located to the NW of Lake Nasser.  Detailed, overlapping mapping frames of the Toshka Lakes shorelines were requested to track changes in water levels and assess the state of shoreline ecosystems), Paramaribo, Suriname (weather conditions were predicted to be clear over Paramaribo.  Looking to the left of track for the urban area located along the banks of the Suriname River in northeastern South America.  Overlapping contextual frames of the city and surrounding area were requested), and Hurricane Earl, Western Atlantic Ocean (Dynamic Event.  Hurricane Earl approached the southeastern US coast at the time of this overpass at a predicted Category 3 strength.  Looking to the right and slightly ahead of track for the storm as ISS passed over the Florida Peninsula.  Well defined outflow banding should have been visible, and there was likely a prominent eye feature).
