01-17-2012January 17, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 01/17/12  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  After wakeup, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  FE-1 Shkaplerov undertook his 3rd onboard session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop. [Ivanishin stood by to assist Anton in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit. Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm. MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes. The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris. The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate. It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms. An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]  In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), CDR Burbank supported JAXA ground commanding by configuring the TCA L (Thermal Control Assembly for Low Temperature Loop) gas trap manual valves and activating the heater for the gas trap. Later in the day, Dan turned the heater off again, reset the valves for the nominal (bypassed) configuration and installed a new thermal insulator on the bypass valve.   Afterwards, Burbank readied the newly-checked out Panasonic 3DA1 camcorder with fresh batteries and then recorded video of the SPHERES activities conducted by FE-6 Pettit.  After reviewing supportive material for the SPHERES ZR (Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites Zero Robotics) session and discussing procedures with the PD (Payload Developer), Don Pettit relocated an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop to the JPM to run SPHERES, then conducted a ~1-hr dry run of the ZR test sessions while the CDR took video for live downlink. [The satellites were then deactivated, the battery packs checked and removed, the beacons powered off, the LPTX antenna disconnected and the gear stowed. SPHERES was originally developed to demonstrate the basics of formation flight, autonomous docking and other multi-spacecraft control algorithms, using beacons as reference for the satellites, to fly formation with or dock to the beacon. A number of programs define various incremental tests including attitude control (performing a series of rotations), attitude-only tracking, attitude and range tracking, docking with handheld and mounted beacons, etc. The payload consists of up to three self-contained 8-inch dia. free-floating satellites which perform the various algorithms (control sequences), commanded and observed by the crew members which provide feedback to shape algorithm development. Each satellite has 12 thrusters and a tank with CO2 for propellant. The first tests, in May 2006, used only one satellite (plus two beacons �C one mounted and one hand-held); a second satellite arrived on ULF1.1, the third on 12A.1. Formation flight and autonomous docking are important enabling technologies for distributed architectures. Per applicable Flight Rule, SPHERES operations have no CO2 output constraints if the CDRA (CO2Removal Assembly) is operating in dual-bed or single-bed mode.]   FE-5 André Kuipers configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 2nd (FD30) ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, after preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres, assisted by Don Pettit. At ~10:05am EST, the FE-5 observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business. [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session. Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, André started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment. During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis. The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute). After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours. After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink. The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise. The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.]  Anatoly Ivanishin conducted the routine verification of yesterday’s refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2. [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update. Before the installation on 8/8 of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1,RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1. On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops. Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily. On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.]  André had another ~2h 25m for unpacking US cargo delivered on Soyuz 29S.  With its KPT-2 Piren pyro-endoscope battery charged overnight, a 10-hr activity, Shkaplerov & Ivanishin spent another ~2.5 hrs with the KPT-2 payload with its BAR science instruments suite, checking out micro conditions of the SM surface in areas with identified signs of microflora growth on the pressurized shell surface and measuring local temperatures with the Piren-V. The work was started yesterday. [Problem area monitoring is necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life. Data were copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities were supported by ground specialist tagup as required. Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night). Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization. Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times. Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]  With the all-crew fire drill OBT (Onboard Training) scheduled tomorrow, CDR Burbank conducted the periodic inspection of the PEPs (Portable Emergency Provisions), checking PFEs (Portable Fire Extinguishers, PBAs (Portable Breathing Apparatus), and EHTKs (Extension Hose Tee Kits). [PFEs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in A/L (Airlock), 2 in Lab,1 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM. PBA O2 Bottles: 5 in Node-1, 1 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 1 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM. QDMAs or Prebreathe Masks: 6 in Node-1, 2 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM. EHTKs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 1 in Node-3.]  In the JAXA JPM, the CDR afterwards removed the ICS MUX (Inter-Satellite Communication System Data Multiplexer) from the ICS rack and packed it in protective layers for return to the ground.  Next, Dan installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) at Lab bay S3 to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances).  FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM. [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]  Anton also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).  Later, Shkaplerov collected the periodic air samples in the RS (Russian Segment), using a Russian AK-1M absorber in the SM & FGB for air & Freon as well as IPD-CO Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (Carbon Monoxide).  Continuing the current round of the periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems in the FGB, FE-4 Kononenko cleaned the detachable VT7 fan screens of the three SOTR gas-liquid heat exchangers (GZhT4), plus the fixed GZhT4 grill with vacuum cleaner and soft brush.  Oleg also took the periodic Russian PZE-MO-3 test for physical fitness evaluation, his first, spending ~90 min on the TVIS treadmill in unmotorized (manual control) mode and wearing the Kardiokassette KK-2000 belt with three chest electrodes.[The fitness test, controlled from the RSE-Med laptop, yields ECG (electrocardiogram) readings to the KK-2000 data storage device, later downlinked via the Regul (BSR-TM) payload telemetry channel. Before the run, the KK-2000 was synchronized with the computer date/time readings. For the ECG, the crewmember rests for 5 min., then works out on the treadmill, first walking 3 min. up to 3.5 km/h, then running at a slow pace of 5-6 km/h for 2 min, at moderate pace of 6.5 km/h for 2 min, followed by the maximum pace not exceeding 10 km/h for 1 min, then walking again at gradually decreasing pace to 3.5 km/h].  FE-4 had another 2hrs for stowing trash and excessed equipment on Progress 45P, docked at DC1, for disposal.  In the US Lab, Don Pettit conducted a leak test on the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), first powering the rack and configuring the WV (Work Volume) appropriately, then waiting up to 90 min for the test to finish. The rack was powered down and the test hardware restowed.  In the Kibo lab, Pettit activated the PLT2 (Payload Laptop Terminal 2) in support of JAXA payload operations.  Kononenko supported the ground-commanded activation of the Elektron oxygen generator (~4:12am EST) by monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating. [The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H2) in the O2 line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup. Elektron was turned off as long as the cabin air was being refreshed from Progress 45P O2 stores.]  With the VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) properly adjusted for recording in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), André Kuipers performed the ESA EPO (Education Program Operation) CONVECTION. [Steps included first demonstrating the convection process in micro-G with a small Convection Loop (being heated but showing no tracers movement), then moving to the Node-3/Cupola to link the small demo and the large convective processes on Earth as seen from space.]  Later, Kuipers readjusted the VCA1 & VCA2 units in COL in preparation for filming tomorrow’s all-crew ISS Fire Drill OBT (Onboard Training).  Pettit has another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on his personal SSC (Station Support Computer). [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]   Oleg conducted another 30-min photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,  FE-4 also performed videography of the lighting conditions in the working volume of the SM using the HVR-Z7E camera and a CF card for downlink via OCA.  Before Presleep, Dan Burbank will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link). After about an hour, Dan will turn MPC routing off again. [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]  FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 & FE-5 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, André at ~5:05 am, Oleg at ~10:05am, Anatoly at ~11:30am, Anton at ~1:05pm EST.  The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4).  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the glaciers of the Pamirs, volcano Idzhen, Kerch Strait, Taman, Laganakskoe plateau, Krasnaya Polyana, Kolka glacier, Glacier Allalin, Cleveland Volcano, Popocatepetl Volcano, Volcano Santa Maria, Fuego Volcano, Volcano Tanguraua, Sangay volcano, Volcano Huascaran, A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).  X2R11 Upgrade: Yesterday, the upgrade of all seven PCSs (Portable Computer System) laptops to Vers. R14 and their reconnection went without issues. All PCSs were then updated by the ground with the latest patches. This completed the X2R11 Day 2 tasks. Today, ground controllers are loading INTSYS R7 to the INT MDMs and the Standby C&C MDM (C&C-2) with CCS R11 and MSS 7.1, completing Phase 1 of the X2R11 transition. Phase 2 of the X2R11 transition is planned to begin on 1/29/12, after Progress 46P docking.  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
