New Status:
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Intermodule Ventilation (IMV) Flow Measurements: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy and FE-6 Nyberg vacuumed the surface of the inlet grilles of the overhead and starboard aft inlets and the starboard forward outlet in the JEM. They then set up the Velocicalc instrument to measure and verify sufficient air flow in those areas.  Ground specialists are reviewing the data to determine if further cleaning actions are required. 
Hicari Experiment: Nyberg removed the sample cartridge, and then separated the sample from the cartridge for return to the ground on a future flight. Hicari is a material science investigation that studies the crystal growth of Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) in the in the Gradient Heating Furnace (GHF). Results will be used in developing more efficient solar cells and semiconductor-based electronics.
General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER) Installation: Cassidy installed and configured GLACIER 4 in Express Rack (ER) 7. This new refrigerator provides additional Cold Stowage space for experiments that require temperatures ranging from +4C and -160C.
Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)-4 Hatch Closure: Cassidy prepared the ATV rack front in the proper final closeout configuration for hatch closure. The crew then closed the hatch and performed leak checks. This activity is in preparation for tomorrow’s Russian EVA #34.
H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)-4 Cargo Operations: The crew completed HTV-4 cargo transfer operations today. Approximately 8 hours of trash loading remain which will occur prior to hatch closure.
