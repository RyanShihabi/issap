USOS Crew Half Duty Day: Today and tomorrow are half-duty days for the USOS crew. They will spend this weekend performing Cygnus operations including vehicle capture and berthing Saturday and ingress and cargo transfer operations on Sunday. Monday will be a full off duty day for the crew.
Multi-Omics Saliva Operations: Peake continued support of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics investigation by collecting body samples this morning and inserting them in a Minus Eight-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI). The Multi-Omics investigation evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts’ immune function, by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the gut microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system.
Habitability Human Factors Post Questionnaire PI Conference: Kopra and Peake configured the INT-P Camcorder to participate in the live video downlink of Habitability and Human Factors post-Questionnaire PI Conference. The investigation collects observations about the relationship between crew members and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a mission’s duration impacts how much space crew members need.
On-Board Training (OBT) Cygnus Capture: The USOS crew members completed another practice session in preparation for Cygnus capture on Saturday. They performed three Capture Point hold runs and two meter runs.
