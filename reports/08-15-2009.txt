ISS On-Orbit Status 08/15/09   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday --- Crew rest day.   Upon wakeup, FE-1 Barratt, FE-2 Kopra, FE-4 Thirsk & FE-5 DeWinne continued their new session of the SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy & Light Exposure during Spaceflight) experiment, logging data from their Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a week-long session.    [To monitor the crewmember’s sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]   The six-member crew performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]   As part of the house cleaning, CDR Padalka & FE-3 Romanenko conducted regular maintenance inspection & cleaning on fan screens, Group A, in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and SM (VPkhO, VPrK, FS5, FS6 & FS9), plus dust filter replacement in the FGB.   At ‾9:05am EDT, the crew held their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.   The crew spent their free time with several VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activities of their choice:  Mike Barratt & Tim Kopra      had ‾4 hrs for conducting a session with the payload SPHERES (Synchronized      Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites), for which Greg      they removed (later replaced) the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment)      “Kabin” enclosure, set up the work area in the Lab and two      PD-100 camcorders for video capture, dimmed the GLAs (General Luminaire      Assemblies) and used the SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop to control      the test satellites.    [The SPHERES      experiment is a test bed for the development and testing of formation      flying and other multi-spacecraft control algorithms.       Today’s session again used three satellites and five beacons on      mounts, with three CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) tanks and six battery      packs, to experiment with docking, formation flight, and      reconfigurations.  Today’s tests explore the effects of fluid      slosh (with full and almost empty tanks), collision avoidance strategy,      thruster failure recovery, formation acquisition and precision control.         Modern robust control techniques are combined with path planning and      formation flight algorithms to improve the performance of the      system.  The session also continued to obtain data for control      reconfiguration after satellites dock (and their mass properties      change).  Per applicable Flight Rule, SPHERES operations have no CO2      output constraints if the CDRA (CO2 Removal Assembly) is      operating in dual-bed or single-bed mode.]  Tim Kopra conducted      completed his second BISE (Bodies in the Space Environment)      experiment.    [BISE is a CSA (Canadian Space      Agency)-sponsored experiment.  The purpose of this long duration      experiment is to collect data to better understand how humans adapt to      microgravity and then re-adapt to normal gravity conditions upon return to      earth.  This experiment involves comparisons of pre-flight,      in-flight, and post-flight perceptions and mental imagery, with special      reference to spaceflight-related decreases in the vertical component of      percepts.] Bob Thirsk used the video      camera to shoot two separate BISE set-ups. The first captured video of      Tim’s BISE experiment operations.  The second recorded      educational science scripts, plus additional information of value in      separate takes (for editing purposes).    FE-1 Barratt continued replenishing the Icepacs in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) by inserting two more +4C Icepac belts into MELFI (Insert 11).   [The Icepacs were originally removed as part of 2J/A packing.  Nine additional activities spaced at least 24 hours apart are being planned over the next two weeks, each time inserting two Icepac belts (to prevent temperature increase inside the MELFI.]   Mike had the second day of his second SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) session (low salt diet), which entails a series of diet intake loggings, body mass measurements and blood & urine samplings in two session blocks.     [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Mike will have to eat special diet (Session 1: High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level and Session 2: Low salt diet).  Solo Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are being logged on sheets stowed in the PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) Consumable Kit in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  SOLO, an ESA/German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device).  Blood samples are taken with the PCBA.  Background:  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]   With the US OGS (Oxygen Generator System) currently down, Gennady Padalka in the course of the day ignited three more SFOG (Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator) “candles” in the RS (Russian Segment).   [The SFOGs, on standby as oxygen source backup to the Elektron and OGS, generate O2 by decomposing cartridges of solid potassium perchlorate (KClO4) into potassium chloride (KCl) and O2 when heated at 450-500 degC.  Each candle releases ‾600 liters (1.74 lbs.) of O2, enough for one person per day.]   Romanenko & DeWinne had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Roman at ‾6:50am, Frank at ‾1:20pm EDT.   At ‾3:00pm, the six crewmembers participated in a teleconference with ground personal, including from ESA and CSA, discussing the ARED (advanced resistive exercise device).  Major points of the agenda were Manipulating ARED, Tips while Exercising, and Questions to the crew.   The FE-3 completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-2), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).    Later, Mike Barratt transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
