ISS On-Orbit Status 01/30/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – crew rest day.  At wake-up, FE-4 Kotov began his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O2 generator.    [The filters were installed by FE-1 Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  The five-member crew performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]  As part of the house cleaning, Maxim & Oleg conducted regular maintenance inspection & cleaning on Group E fan screens in SM and TsV2 in the FGB.  CDR Williams completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops.  About 10 min after A31p FS reboot, Jeff also rebooted all T61p ISS servers laptops.   In preparation of Progress 36P arrival (2/4), Williams installed the alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab to protect the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) from structural dynamics disturbances.  The CDR filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]  FE-6 Creamer took IMV (Intermodule Module Ventilation) flow measurements for specific locations in the SM (Service Module), Lab, Node-2 & Node-1, using the electronic Velocicalc instrument at the various IMV outlets.  Williams, Creamer & Noguchi each performed a VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activity: -  After setting up the camcorder for recording video, Jeff reviewed instructions and then conducted the EPO (Educational Program Operations) discussion & demo of “Centripetal Force & Acceleration”, on practical uses of centripetal force & acceleration onboard the ISS  [for example, centrifugal force, i.e. slow crewmember rotation (~15 RPM), is being used in zero-G to “degas” CWCs (Contingency Water Containers) and other water bags];TJ worked in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) on the BLB BGB (BIOLAB Bioglovebox), checking leak tightness (hermeticity) of BGB seals and gloves, andSoichi set up the MD (Marangoni Deformation) core on the MWA I/F (Maintenance Work Area Interface) B in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), performed a leak check and prepared for a new experiment run by taking out silicone oil from the used MS PTV05 Cassette and supplying it to the MD30 Cooling Disk.  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).  At ~12:25pm, TJ had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).

CETSOIL (ESA):   MSRR-1 activities have continued with the processing of the MICAST#3 Sample Cartridge Assembly (SCA) on 1/26 & 1/27.  After the MSL facility activation, an issue occurred with an incorrect sample temperature reading preventing the chamber lid opening for the SCA exchange.  Luckily, a manual workaround was able to override the thermocouple readings, which allowed the chamber lid to be opened.  The SCA was exchanged for MICAST#6 on 1/25. This cartridge will be processed next week. Our plan is to process a total of four SCAs which will later be brought back on STS-130 (20A).   CFE (Capillary Flow Experiment):    Reserve.

We are pleased to report your acquisition of imagery for the following CEO Target Requests:  Kabul, Afghanistan – good mapping session – we will try again for less clouds; Muscat, Oman – several frames – will try again for better focus; Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania – excellent context views – we are looking now for more frames from that session acquired with the long lens; and Malabo, Equatorial Guinea – nailed it – must try again with better lighting conditions.  One of your detailed views of the Port-au-Prince area of Haiti was annotated and compared with imagery from Increment 20 for NASA/PAO.  This past weekend, one of your excellent responses to a recent CEO Target request (Dubai “Palms” and “World”, United Arab Republic) was published on NASA/GSFC’s Earth Observatory website.  In one particularly fine view, you acquired not only a detailed view of both of these internationally renowned man-made structures, but also visible is the shadow of the world’s tallest structure, the Burj Tower.  That was quite a coup!  Thanks, our hats are off to you.”  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Madrid, Spain (clear weather was predicted to hold over Madrid during this overpass.  The capital city of Spain is also the third-largest metro area in Europe [after Paris and London].  Looking slightly to the right of track during the descending pass over the target.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban area were requested), and Sudbury Impact Crater, Ontario, Canada (weather was predicted to be clear over this impact crater.  ISS had a nadir-viewing pass over the impact crater, which is likely to be snow-covered.  The originally circular Sudbury Impact Crater, formed approximately 2 billion years ago, has been deformed into an elliptical shape by subsequent geological processes.  Overlapping mapping frames, taken along track, were requested).
