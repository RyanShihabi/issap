ISS On-Orbit Status 08/28/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – crew rest day.  TVIS is Go!   Upon wake-up, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, FE-4 Wheelock & FE-6 Walker completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]   For her on-going 3rd Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment, Shannon Walker observed the initial 10-min rest period before going about her business, swapping Makita batteries as required.  Midpoint for the entire ICV run was reached at about 1:40pm EDT.  HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) recording was finished at ~11:00am and re-started for the second 24 hrs after ARED exercise, immediately before Presleep.      [The rest period involved relaxing & breathing normally for 10 minutes under quiet, restful conditions.  ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres/BP to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Shannon continued the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing were timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After approximately 24 hrs (today at ~11:00am), the Cardiopres was temporarily doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery were changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).  The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.]   The six station residents completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]   As part of the uborka house cleaning, the Russian crewmembers conducted regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).   FE-5 Yurchikhin performed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems (UOV) in the SM & FGB, cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode   Fyodor also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]  CDR Skvortsov completed periodic routine maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, changing out replaceable parts with new components, such as a filter insert (F-V), the urine receptacle (MP), the pretreat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pretreat & water dispenser.  Also replaced was the ASU’s air filter.  All old parts were trashed in the Progress 38P, and the IMS (Inventory Management System) was updated.     [E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), CrO3 (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H2O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.]   At ~9:00am EDT, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.   Doug Wheelock completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router & FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops (the latter required to mitigate the problem of iPV and OSTPV not opening up procedures due to a memory leak in the “Tomcat” software).  After a period of no less than 10 min later, Wheels also rebooted the two ISS network servers (SERVER1 & 2).   FE-3 & FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Misha at ~10:45am, Shannon at ~12:20pm EDT.   Several new task items were uplinked for the voluntary “job  jar” job list of the US crewmembers, including taking flange bracket photography, locating PFS (Pulmonary Function System) hardware items, and reconfiguring stowage in the WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) volume to enable easier access for photography.    Jobs listed for Skvortsov & Kornienko today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –  Another ~30-min. run of      the GFI-8      "Uragan"      (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera      photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, shooting large glaciers of      the South Patagonia ice field (right of flight path), the Uppsala glacier,      the Viedma glacier, and the Chico glacier in nadir, and A ~30-min. session for      Russia's EKON      Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial      photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X      camera with the RSK-1      laptop.    The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3, FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is regularly being done after the last T2 session of the day.]  TVIS Update:   FCT (Flight Control Team) uplink:  “Great work on the TVIS Troubleshooting yesterday.  TVIS is now GO for use!”.

In this hybrid configuration, the FSL VMU showed the same anomalous symptoms as before.  The next day, also the Digital Line Tape (DLT) recorder and the S/W were downgraded to their initial configuration.  After this downgrade, a detailed FSL VMU check-out procedure has been run through by ground commanding.  FSL VMU now shows nominal behavior, except for the last step(s) of the backup and restore functions to and from the tape cartridge which had to be aborted. This needs follow-up.   “Thanks, Wheels, for your support in bringing FSL VMU back in a nominal configuration!”  FWED (Flywheel Exercise Device, ESA):     No report.

We plan to implement this scheduling for future sessions beyond your mission.  We know working with the hardware is difficult and appreciate your continued participation in the study. Please let us know if you have any more operational recommendations.   Shannon: Well done on a successful VO2max session last Friday!  Initial analysis of the data looks good.  As you noticed, the TFM insert is finicky; remember to tighten it as hard as you can.  The PIs have looked at the data and the loss of TFM signal during a portion of your exercise did result in some data loss for the EKE study, but does not impact your status as a subject.
