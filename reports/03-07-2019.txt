SpaceX (SpX) Crew Dragon Demonstration 1 Departure Preparation: Today the crew performed refresher training in preparation for tomorrow’s Crew Dragon departure. In addition, they loaded final cargo, obtained closeout imagery, acquired samples of the atmosphere, then closed the hatches between ISS and Crew Dragon. Undocking is planned for Friday, March 8 at 01:26 AM CT with splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean taking place at ~7:45 AM CT the same day. This uncrewed flight test marks a significant step towards returning capability to launch astronauts on a U.S. built spacecraft from U.S. soil.
Plasma Krystall-4 (PK-4): Today a crewmember initiated three runs for group 3 of the PK-4 Experiment and reconfigured the hose connection to use the Neon Gas supply. PK-4 is a scientific collaboration between the European Space Agency and the Roscosmos, performing research in the field of “Complex Plasmas”: low temperature gaseous mixtures composed of ionized gas, neutral gas, and micron-sized particles.
Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS)-02:  A crewmember relocated the AMS laptop from the Lab Express Rack (ER)-1 to Columbus module ER-3. The move was required in preparation for upgrading Lab ER-1 with an Improved Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway (iPEHG) next week. AMS-02 is a state-of-the-art particle physics detector that uses the unique environment of space to advance knowledge of the universe and lead to the understanding of the universe’s origin by searching for antimatter, dark matter and measuring cosmic rays.
