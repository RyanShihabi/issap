ISS On-Orbit Status 05/28/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – FD13 (Flight Day 13) of STS-134/Endeavour/ULF-6. Onboard crew complement: 9.  ·        ISS crew sleep schedule:  Wake – 7:56pm last night; Sleep – 11:26am (till 7:56pm) today.·        Shuttle sleep schedule:  Wake – 7:56pm last night; Sleep – 11:56am (till 7:56pm) today. First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking & brushing teeth, FE-3 Ron Garan began his 4th saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 4), today collecting dry saliva samples five times in the course of the day.        [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] Also at wake-up, Garan undertook another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, his 13th.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] In support of the JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), body samples were collected in the morning by Ron Garan from PLT Gregory Johnson and himself, then inserted into the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezer for preservation.      [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss.] CDR Borisenko & FE-1 Samokutyayev joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of the uborka house cleaning, Andrey & Aleksandr completed regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM (Service Module). Later, the CDR conducted the daily monitoring of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM which is taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle docked phase.  The data were later copied from the BUSD Control & Data Gathering Unit to a USB-D-M-3 stick for downlink to the ground.  The BUSD archive was then deleted and the DAKON-M restarted.      [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.] Borisenko also conducted the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways to see how the ventilation/circulation system is coping with the 9-person crew.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] In a somewhat unusual twist of timelines, Shuttle crewmembers MS4 Chamitoff & MS1 Fincke performed major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) in the ISS by working in Node-3 on restoring the CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) to full service.      [After Ron Garan had removed the failed Desiccant/Sorbent Bed 2 from the rear of the CDRA rack at Bay A4 on 5/24, Spanky & Taz had a hard time today completing the installation of the new Bed 201 frame delivered on ULF6 due to fit check problems.  The installation took longer than anticipated but was completed.  Work continues and is expected to be finished to allow the Shuttle reboost and undocking remain on schedule as planned.  Interesting: a Shuttle crew doing an ISS installation of a Russian component.] FE-3 Garan meanwhile worked with CDR Mark Kelly & MS3 Andrew Feustel on post-EVA EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) reconfiguration and tools & hardware transfers.     [EMUs 3005 & 3011 stay on ISS (3011 was moved from the PMM/Permanent Multipurpose Module to the U.S. Airlock).  EMUs 3004 & 3018 were reconfigured for return to Earth.] Afterwards, Ron swapped the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezers, disconnecting the sample-loaded Descent GLACIER on the ISS and exchanging it for the Ascent GLACIER with Roberto Vittori, photographed by Box Johnson.      [Power interrupts had to be limited to 30 min for the -35 degC unit and limited to 120 min for the ‑95 degC unit during transfer.] Roberto & Drew also worked several hours on Middeck Transfers between Shuttle & ISS. Other activities completed by Ron Garan included –Activation of the SAMS ICU (Space Acceleration Measurement System / Interim Control Unit) in the Lab’s ER1 (EXPRESS Rack 1), Drawer 2,Building three KTO solid waste containers for the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) from Russian bottom & body components,Conducting, after a calibration check, the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose;  [after the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged],Performing the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes, [the current card (27-0014H) lists 113 CWCs (2,169.7 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (10 CWCs with 392.0 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 87.0 L in 3 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (91 CWCs with 1,668.3 L for reserve (also 14 expired bags with 251.5 L);  4. condensate water (76.6 L in 5 bags, plus 5 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (32.8 L in 2 CWCs from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health], andCompleting periodic maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), inspecting the exercise rope knot for fraying or damage in rope or rope strands as well as the periodic evacuation of its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration.      [Knot can be loosened as needed to aid in the inspection.  Areas of concern are those with the tightest diameters (i.e. sections of rope contacting the French Clip).  If damage is found, Ron was to photo document it and notify MCC-Houston.] Sasha conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Andrey powered up the amateur/ham radio equipment in the SM. At ~1:00am EDT, after Borisenko had powered up the amateur/ham equipment in the SM Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply), he & Samokutyayev used it  for a ham radio session with students at the International Children’s Creative Film & Video Festival “St. Petersburg Movie Screen” in St. Petersburg, Russia.  At ~10:16am, Garan, Kelly & Johnson supported an educational PAO/TV downlink, fielding questions from students at a Tucson Civic Event at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.     [In attendance on the ground were Michael J. Drake, Head, Department of Planetary Sciences and Director, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory; middle school students; Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) teachers and graduates of the University of Arizona.  Additional Guests: (From the Tucson NW Fire District): Paul Mischel and daughter Emma; Kyle Canty and daughter Molly; Kirk Travis Sr. and son Kirk Jr.] FE-1 & FE-3 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Ron at ~8:41pm, Sasha at ~7:31am EDT. At ~8:03am, Ron also had his weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- & Ku-band audio/video. Oxygen Transfer Update:    The planned O2 transfer was completed using the backup hose with no issues, with about 10 lbs of O2 transferred from the Shuttle to the A/L (Airlock) tanks.  Teardown of the transfer equipment will be completed tomorrow by Garan & Kelly. Reboost Update:   The ISS reboost by Shuttle pilot Greg Johnson using the VCRS (Vernier Reaction Control System, Config. 3/Auto Reboost) is scheduled for early tomorrow morning at ~1:01am. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-1).  Ron Garan’s exercise was not reported.

STP-H3 (Space Test Program – Houston 3):      MHTEX was successfully activated and the priming successfully completed.  The Capillary Pumped Loops startup was successfully performed as well as demonstration of the Advanced Evaporator.  The system is being put into steady state mode for heat load performance characterization that will continue for approximately 2 months before continuing on to the next test objective.  The DISC experiment is a star field imager and was successfully activated. It has demonstrated its basic capability to acquire time tagged images and the PIs are currently working to process the raw data into a useable star tracking image.  Canary, an ion spectrometer, is alive and operating nominally. Data has been taken and downlinked during several special command windows.  The VADER activation and aliveness test went well.  The VADER sample performance is degraded as expected due to the prolonged humidity exposure pre-flight.  During EVA-3, Drew used an IR camera to take an 8 minute video of the VADER while the variable emissivity devices were in transition.  This video has been received and currently being analyzed.  This has the potential to return up to 70% of the Science by characterizing the degradation, effectively saving the VADER mission.  The STP-H3 team would like to send a huge thanks to the crew for performing this task on such short notice.
