P6 Battery Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #2 (US EVA #57):  Today, the ISS crew completed EVA #2 with the crew lock egress occurring around 6:38 am CT.  Today’s EVA focused on completing the P6 Solar Array Channel 2B Li-Ion battery upgrades.  This included installing the third and final Li-Ion battery to the Channel 2B IEA.  The official EVA duration was 6 hours and 45 min. Tasks accomplished are as follows:

Primary tasks:

NiH2 Battery 4 from the Integrated Equipment Assembly (IEA) to the External Pallet (EP) Slot B.
Adapter Plate (AP) B from the EP to Slot 4 on the IEA
NiH2 Battery 6 from the IEA to AP-B Slot 4 on the IEA
Li-Ion Battery D from the EP to Slot 6 on the IEA.
NiH2 Battery 5 from the IEA to EP D.
AP-D from the EP to Slot 5 on the IEA.
Site 4B Worksite Prep


Get ahead tasks completed:

4B NiH2 battery #5 H1 bolt torque release to support Robotics installation of spare Li-Ion battery.
Disconnect of Ethernet Cables from EXT-EPIC MDMs.
P6 WIF 7 & 9 inspections.



US Lab Intermodular Ventilation (IMV) Bypass Duct:  Today, the crew completed the US Lab IMV bypass duct installation. This involved installing a Bypass Duct that will run through the LAB to send air from Node 3 directly to Node 2 in order to provide better air mixing across the USOS.
