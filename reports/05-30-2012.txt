ISS On-Orbit Status 05/30/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Sleep Cycle Shift:  Due to tomorrow morning’s early unberthing (4:05am EDT) & release (5:35am EDT) of the SpaceX Dragon capsule, the ISS crew has a shorter workday (by 2 hrs), followed by an adjustment back to regular tomorrow:Wake  – 2:00am (this morning)Sleep  – 3:30pmWake  – 12:00am midnight (tonight)Sleep  – 3:30pm (tomorrow)Wake  – 2:00am (6/1, return to normal). After wakeup, FE-2 Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also at wakeup, FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 44th for Don & André, the 4th for Joe.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Joe Acaba had Day 3 of his first (FD15) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  After recording his diet input today, Joe will begin the urine collections for pH value tomorrow (5/31) and blood sampling on Friday (6/1).       [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15th day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 & 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.] After setting up the necessary equipment, Acaba was also the subject for his first session with the periodic 30-min US PHS (Periodic Health Status)/Without Blood Labs exam, with FE-5 Kuipers acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  FE-5 then logged the data and stowed the equipment.  A subjective evaluation was part of the test.    [The assessment used the AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack), stethoscope, oral disposable thermometer and ABPC (Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff) from the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack).  All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.  The PHS exam is guided by special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.] FE-1 Padalka configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h 15m session, his first, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] At the SM aft port, CDR Kononenko conducted the periodic task of tightening the BZV quick release screw clamps of the SSVP docking mechanism on the ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) interface side. Afterwards, with its battery freshly charged yesterday, Oleg installed the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9, using it to measure UV (ultraviolet) emissions in Earth’s upper atmosphere during global electromagnetic events (7:30am-7:50am EDT) under ground commanding.  Sergei Revin assisted as part of functional “knowledge handovers”.  Later, the CDR dismantled the equipment and dumped the data from Laptop 3 via the RSS1 terminal.       [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] Also as a crew handover activity, Oleg & Sergei verified proper functioning of the Matryoshka RBO-3-2 Lulin-5 electronics box which is connected to the spherical sensor-equipped “phantom” in the MRM1 Rassvet module.        [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]  Joe had time set aside to familiarize himself with cold storage procedures on board, reviewing CBT (Computer-Based Training) material on MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) hardware and activities through the ILRT (ISS Library Reference Tool) link on an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop. Performing IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the ECLSS UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) in Node-3, FE-6 Pettit hooked up the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) in the WRS2 (Water Recovery System 2) rack for the periodic tank backfill with a QD (Quick Disconnect) hose for processing, then closed out the worksite. Continuing the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, Sergei worked in the MRM1 (Mini-Research Module 1) Rassvet, replacing the SKPF1 & SKPF2 dust filters with new units and cleaning the SOTR gas-liquid heat exchangers (GZhT4). Gennady spent ~2 hrs in the FGB Zarya module, removing three OSP-4 fire extinguishers of the Russian SPOPT (Fire Detection & Suppression System) and replacing them with new units.     [The removed items were discarded, and the IMS (Inventory Management System) database was updated accordingly.}  Afterwards, FE-1 performed checkouts on the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system’s TA968MA units of the PTsB Central Processor Subsystem primary & backup sets in the SM by taking voltage measurements on the power buses of the BGPO1 & BGPO2 Exchange Programs Generators.  With the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) now regrappled at the Dragon’s FRGF (Flight Releasable Grapple Fixture) by ground commanding, and the SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) secured back at the MBS PDGF-2 (Mobile Base System Power & Data Grapple Fixture 2), Joe, Don & André had another 50 min for reviewing SSRMS Unberth & Release Robotics procedures. Afterwards, Don & André egressed the Dragon capsule and configured the vestibule for the demating of one ARS (Atmosphere Revitalization System) jumper, two 1553 data cables and one power jumper. As final step, FE-5 & FE-6 installed the CPAs (Controller Panel Assemblies) at the Node-2 nadir CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism) so that ground controllers can begin preparing the CBM for unberthing.       [Demating is scheduled to be done at ~12:35am EDT tomorrow morning, followed by hatch closure & vestibule depressurization at ~12:45am and IPCU (ISS Power Converter Unit) deactivation at ~12:50am.] Dragon unberthing will be at ~4:05am EDT and its release from the SSRMS at ~5:35am.  Shortly thereafter, Dragon will exit the ISS “Keep Out Sphere”, perform several separation burns and the final deorbit burn at 10:51am.  Splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 490 nmi SW of Los Angeles, is then expected at 11:44am EDT (9 days 7 hours, 57 minutes 2 seconds after launch). Kuipers serviced the VIABLE experiment (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS), touching and blowing the top of each of 4 VIABLE bags in the FGB (loc. 409) where they are stowed to collect environment samples.       [This investigation evaluates microbial biofilm development on space materials.  Objectives are to determine the microbial strain producing the anti-biofilm product, evaluate the chemical nature of the anti-biofilm product, study the innovative materials which are chemo-physically treated, and address the biological safety issues associated with microbial biofilms.  Background: Most surfaces are covered with microorganisms under natural conditions.  The process by which a complex community of microorganisms is established on a surface is known as biofilm formation.  Microbial biofilms can exist in many different forms by a wide range of microorganisms.  The process of biofilm formation is a prerequisite for substantial corrosion and/or deterioration of the underlying materials to take place.  VIABLE samples are composed by both metallic and textile space materials either conventional or innovative (Aluminum, Armaflex and Betacloth).  They are placed inside four foam lined Nomex bags, specifically:  Pouch 1 - untreated space materials; Pouch 2 - space materials pre-treated with biosurfactants; Pouch 3 - space materials pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide; Pouch 4 - space materials chemo-physically pre-treated with silica and silver coating.] Kononenko completed his 11th data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] Oleg also took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sergei conducted the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-2 had ~40 min reserved for another round of filming onboard “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7E camcorder and the NIKON D2X & D3 still cameras, part of the ongoing effort to create a “Life on the Station” photo & video documentary database on the flight of ISS-31 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include running experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] 30S crewmembers Padalka, Revin & Acaba again had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. Joe & Don had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Before Presleep, FE-6 will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~12:25pm EDT, Pettit had his regular weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- & Ku-band audio/video. The crew worked out with a somewhat reduced physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-2).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Tasks listed for Kononenko, Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop (Oleg+Gennady), andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb) (all). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Kwanza Basin, NW Angola (the crew was to shoot overlapping images taken along track.  General views were requested to document a thin string of new developments [infrastructure such as main roads, power lines, and settlements along the few roads] between the capital city, Luanda, and new oilfields inland.  The rationale behind imaging this site is to document planned and unplanned changes in the Luanda–oilfields corridor developing between the coastal capital city, Luanda, and the new oilfields to the northeast.  Few usable baseline images have yet been acquired), Mbabane, Swaziland (WORLD CAPITALS COLLECTION:  This small capital city lied left of track.  Visual cues are dark-toned forest plantations in the region: looking left, at the north end of a thin finger of forest), Huachuca Mountains, SE Arizona (looking right for the dark Huachuca mountain sides, just after crossing over Tucson, AZ).  This roughly horseshoe-shaped cluster of mountains is situated on the US–Mexico border, about 70 miles southeast of Tucson.  CEO observers are seeking detailed mapping views of this target for baseline and change detection of a unique and threatened habitat), Sierra el Tigre, Northern Mexico (shooting a nadir mapping strip long track of this “sky island”.  Sky islands are high altitude, cool mountain ranges with higher rainfall, termed islands because they are surrounded by low hot deserts.  The sky islands, of which there are many, are a major natural resource for many products.  Land use mapping—of forest health [color] and especially uncontrolled logging—is of interest to scientists from several disciplines), Ampato Glaciers, Peru (shooting a mapping pass along, and just left of track, to capture these glaciers.  The glaciers occupy several volcanic peaks, the largest on Coropuna Volcano between two major canyons.  Many tropical ice caps are melting fast.  Detailed images are requested to examine the present area of the ice), and Ubinas Volcano, Peru (looking left, half way between the coast and Lake Titicaca, for the main visual cues.  Ubinas is easier to spot than many Andean volcanoes as an isolated peak on the flank of a large canyon.  Requested were detailed, overlapping frames of the volcano summit and flanks.   The caldera contains an ash cone, and debris avalanche deposits extending 10 km from the southeast flank of the volcano).
