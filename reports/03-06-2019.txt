Plasma Krystall-4 (PK-4): Today a crewmember initiated three runs for the group 2 of the PK-4 experiment and performed a hard drive change out for data downlink. PK-4 is a scientific collaboration between the ESA and the Roscosmos, performing research in the field of “Complex Plasmas”: low temperature gaseous mixtures composed of ionized gas, neutral gas, and micron-sized particles.
Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument – Diffusion and Soret Coefficient (SODI-DSC): Today a crewmember stowed the Alternate Diffusion and Soret Coefficient (DSC) sample. The SODI-DSC experiment will study diffusion in six different liquids over time in the absence of convection induced by the gravity field.
57 Soyuz (57S) Emergency Egress Drill: All three 57S crewmembers participated in a training session today where they reviewed and practiced procedures that would be performed in the event of an emergency that required the crew to egress ISS and execute an emergency descent. This training is scheduled after the crew has been onboard for 12 to 14 weeks and every 2.5 months thereafter. 
Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA) Replacement: Following yesterday’s removal of the MCA Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU)-2, the crew successfully installed a new unit within the LAB1D6 location this morning. The failed unit experienced an ion pump short and failed in December 2018 and will be returned to the ground for refurbishment via SpaceX-17, currently planned for April of this year. The MCA is a mass spectrometer based system that measures the major atmospheric constituents on the ISS.
