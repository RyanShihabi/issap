Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument – Diffusion and Soret Coefficient (SODI-DSC): Today, a crewmember changed-out the memory flash disk from the SODI hardware. The Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument – Diffusion and Soret Coefficient (SODI-DSC) experiment will study diffusion in six different liquids over time in the absence of convection induced by the gravity field.
Sally Ride Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle Schools (EarthKAM): Today, a crewmember relocated the SSC18 laptop from the FGB to the Node 1 for use by the EarthKAM payload. EarthKAM allows thousands of students to photograph and examine Earth from a space crew’s perspective. Using the Internet, the students control a special digital camera mounted on-board the ISS. This enables them to photograph the Earth’s coastlines, mountain ranges and other geographic items of interest from the unique vantage point of space. The EarthKAM team then posts these photographs on the Internet for viewing by the public and participating classrooms around the world.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) 3006 Fan Pump Separator Remove and Replace (R&R): On January 22, the FPS in EMU 3006 would not activate during a planned loop scrub activity. Today, the failed FPS was removed from EMU 3006 and replaced with an on-orbit spare. Following the R&R, the crew was able to prime the Water Pump and reconfigure the EMU. On Wednesday, the crew will perform a Return to Service Checkout on EMU 3006 as well as perform an EMU Data Recorder (EDAR) installation.
