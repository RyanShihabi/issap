ISS On-Orbit Status 10/16/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Sunday – Crew off duty.    Ahead:  Week 5 of Increment 29 (three-person crew). FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. In COL (Columbus Orbital Facility), FE-5 removed stowage from in front of the HRF-2 (Human Research Facility 2) Rack location at bay A4 in support of ICV operations requiring access to the rack. Afterwards, Satoshi Furukawa set up the HRF laptop and Actiwatch Dock for his upcoming 3rd ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session, initialized two Actiwatch “Spectrum” units and formatted two HiFi CF cards. Volkov completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] Sergei also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.  This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for calldown.       [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers]. As his VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) selection today, Furukawa activated MSPR (Multi-Purpose Small Payload Rack) components in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and checked out the VRU (Video Compression & Recording Unit)/Hub, MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) & MPLT in the MSPR, as well as the GUI (Graphic User Interface) function for MSPR VRU control. Later, Satoshi also powered on the SAMS ICU (Space Acceleration Measurement System / Interim Control Unit) in the Lab ER1 (EXPRESS Rack 1), Drawer 2. FE-4 Volkov installed the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #1, with Laptop 3, for another run of spectral observation of Earth Surface and Earth Emission layer radiance.       [“Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] At ~8:20am EDT, Sergey conducted a PAO telephone conference with the editor of the Rossiyskiy Cosmos Magazine via S-Band. CDR & FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) on their schedule, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Mike at ~3:15pm, Satoshi at ~4:45pam EDT. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
