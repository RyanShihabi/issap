New Status: 
Seedling Growth Experiment: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy removed the Experiment Container (EC) and inserted it into the Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) which completed the 4th and final run of this experiment. Seedling Growth studies the effects of microgravity on the growth of plants and is being performed on board the ISS in collaboration with the European Space Agency. Images of the plants were captured and downlinked to Earth. Samples of the plants were harvested and will be returned to Earth for scientific analysis. The results of this experiment can lead to information that will aid researchers in food production studies concerning future long-duration space missions, as well as data that will enhance crop production on Earth.

Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) Wake Radiator Photography Survey: Cassidy took photos of the AMS Wake Radiator and downlinked them to the ground to assist with characterizing potential surface discoloration that was observed on the AMS wake radiator during the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) / Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) video survey performed on January 25. AMS requires resolution / characterization of this potential discoloration to complete imagery in the near term as it will assist AMS in understanding anomalous thermal signatures for avionics on this radiator and may help determine future courses of action.
EXpedite PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Laptop Computer (ELC)-3 Laptop Software Load: Cassidy loaded EXPRESS Rack 3 laptop with software Version 9.0.  Following this activity, he reloaded payload specific software unique to this laptop for Serial Network Flow Monitor (SNFM) and European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) experiments.
