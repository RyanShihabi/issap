ISS On-Orbit Status 02/03/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  After wakeup this morning, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-6 Pettit completed Part 3 of the periodic acoustic measurement protocol, downloading the recorded data from the acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) deployed yesterday for static measurements in the station, then stowing the recorders.      [#1004 in SM above TVIS treadmill, #1003 in Node-3, #1005 in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).] Dan Burbank & André Kuipers are on Day 6 of Session 1 of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment, continuing the current High Salt diet, with daily diet log entries.  Today’s activities involved taking, for the 2nd time, measurements of body mass (BMM) with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device), final urine sampling after the 24-hr collections, and securing their blood samples in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Special diet intake & logging was not required.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included), the crewmember is ingesting one of two special diets (low salt & high salt content).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.] With its battery freshly charged overnight, FE-2 Anatoly Ivanishin installed & started the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 for another run, using it to observe the Earth surface and atmosphere at terminator crossing (11:20-11:40am EST).  Later, Anatoly dismantled the equipment again and dumped the data from Laptop 3 via the RSS1 terminal.      [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), the CDR supported the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 1 once every two hours for seven days.  Burbank performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.] In the Lab, André Kuipers serviced the EarthKAM (EKAM/Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack by changing battery twice during the day.     [EK uses a NIKON D2Xs electronic still camera with 50mm and 180mm lenses, powered by a battery, taking pictures by remote operation from the ground, without crew interaction.  It is available for students who submit image requests and conduct geographic research.  The requests are uplinked in a camera control file to the A31p SSC-20 (Station Support Computer) laptop which then activates the camera at specified times and receives the digital images from the camera’s storage card on its hard drive, for subsequent downlink via OpsLAN.  The camera battery is changed when no pictures are being taken.  EKAM uses new software on SSC-20 which replaces the version used for the DCS 760 camera. This is the 4th use of the D2Xs camera by EKAM.  Students around the world are anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images.] FE-6 Pettit downloaded the accumulated data from his and Burbank’s recent 2nd (FD30) 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session from two Actiwatch Spectrums and two HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1).  The laptop was then powered off.      [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] Later, with the G1 HD camcorder set up in the JAXA Kibo laboratory for downlinking his activity, Don conducted another “LEGO Bricks” EPO (Education Payload Activity) session in the JPM MWA (Maintenance Work Area), building a model of a Land Yacht from Lego pieces from a guide book for ground audiences. FE-1 Shkaplerov & FE-4 Oleg Kononenko spent several hours gathering tools & equipment for their upcoming spacewalk, Orlan EVA-30, on 2/16, staging it in the DC1 airlock, then configuring the DC1 and SM PkhO Transfer Compartment for the spacewalk.        [During the 6h 3m spacewalk (hatch open ~9:23am EST), Kononenko (EV1) & Shkaplerov (EV2) are scheduled to relocate the Strela-1 “crane” from DC1 to MRM2, install SMDPs (SM Debris Panels) on the SM (RO1 segment), and, if time permits, support the “Test” experiment on the SM RO1, install support struts on the DC1 EVA ladder, and install sample exposure panels of the space experiment “Vinoslivost” on MRM2.]  In the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Burbank configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware including MBS (Mixing Bag System), including calibrating the PPFS software and checking instruments.  For the next 3-4 hrs, Dan then conducted his 3rd session with the VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, integrated with Thermolab (head sensors).  After the session, the CDR powered down, cleaned up & partially stowed the equipment, and downloaded the data to a PCS laptop.  The relocated stowage bags were then returned to their nominal location.          [The experiment VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.] André Kuipers conducted his weekly task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space. Don Pettit spent time working on the MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2), reorganizing the contents of Dewar 1 and Dewar 2, the trays of which were switched multiple times during the MELFI-2 anomalies some time ago.      [After trashing some items and rearranging half-box modules and green -32 degC ice bricks, Melfi-2 Dewars 1 & 2 now contain one half-box module and 4 green ice bricks in each of their 4 trays.] Pettit also changed the HDD (Hard Disk Drive) for the AMS-02 (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer) in its laptop at the ER6 (EXPRESS Rack 6) location of Lab O4.  Kuipers took documentary photography of the exchange.     [The old HD #1011 was replaced with HD #1012.] In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), André supported a failure investigation on the ER4 RIC (Rack Interface Controller) which last year (12/8) had gone into a continuous reboot state, rendering the rack unusable.      [FE-5 ran RIC debug software and undertook remedial steps intended to capture data required to determine the cause of this error and to lead to a corrective action.] On TsUP Go, Ivanishin was to refresh ISS cabin atmosphere with another O2 repress from Progress M-14/46P (#414) SRPK tankage. Anatoly also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Later, in the FGB, FE-2 performed troubleshooting tests on the EPS (Electrical Power System) SNT A 53 voltage converter/stabilizer (120V/28V), using the MMTs-01 MultiMeter to take continuity (resistance) measurements on its connectors, supported by ground specialist tagup via S-band.  André Kuipers had time scheduled for continuing unpacking US cargo delivered on Progress 45P, then joined Dan Burbank in unpacking US supplies brought up by Progress 46P. The CDR, FE-5 & FE-6 filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Dan’s 10th, André’s & Don’s 5th.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~3:15am EST, Burbank, Ivanishin, Shkaplerov, Kuipers, Kononenko & Pettit held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~3:30am, Anton, Oleg & Anatoly linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~12:20pm, Burbank conducted the regular IMS (Inventory Management System) stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists. At ~2:00pm, the crew was scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H. Dan & Don had another time slot reserved for making entries in their electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Before Presleep, Pettit will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan will turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).    [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] WRM Update:     A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.           [The new card (29-0008I) lists 39 CWCs (498.2 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (3 CWCs with 88.4 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria, plus 1 empty bag;  2. Condensate water (2 CWCs with 9.8 L, 9 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (14 CWCs with 232.9 L; also 8 expired bags with 140.5 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 6.4 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked today were Kerguelen Is., S. Indian Ocean (a cloud-free gap was predicted for late in the day local Kerguelen time, so one of three passes was selected for this opportunity.  Looking just right for the large ice cap, and especially the glacier tongues, on the highest part of the big island), and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (looking left for Guanabara Bay, the major visual cue, with Rio de Janeiro situated on its southern shore.  Rio’s airport is located on the island within the bay. Imaging opportunity exists between cloud masses).
