09-12-2012September 12, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 09/12/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Sayonara, Kounotori-3!   The Japanese HTV-3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle) “White Stork 3” was successfully unberthed at about 7:50am EDT and released from the Canadian robot arm at 11:50am.  HTV is on a good trajectory to perform its reentry: Final deorbit burn (DOM3): Friday (9/14) at ~12:51am; entry interface: ~1:24am. After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Sunita Williams & FE-6 Akihiko Hoshide completed their post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 37th for Joe, the 22nd for Suni & Aki.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] At wakeup, FE-2 Revin serviced the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, extracting the top of the bioreactor (#6) from the TBU-V incubator (+29 degC), shaking it with “moderately strong” movements for 2 minutes without taking it out of the case and inserting it again in TBU-V.    [Started on 8/23, this activity is being carried out for 21 days, once in the morning and once in the evening.] Later in the day, Sergei switched the TBU temperature setting for KASKAD to +4degC. CDR Padalka performed his 2nd session with the MBI-29 IMMUNO (Neuroendocrine & Immune Responses in Humans During & After Long Term Stay at ISS) equipment, consisting of the Plazma-03 consumables kit, the SALIVA-I IMMUNO kit and the Plazma-03 Centrifuge to collect saliva and venous blood samples which were then processed and handed over to FE-5 Williams for cold-storage in MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1).  Yuri assisted as CMO (Crew Medical Officer). FE-3 Acaba had Day 4 of his 4th (FD120) and final suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of pH testing.  After recording his diet input today, Joe began the urine collections for his Nutrition/Repository/Pro K 24-hour protocol and then prepared the equipment for the associated blood sampling tomorrow (9/13) with Pro K photography.      [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] At about 10:50am EDT, Joe also concluded his 4th (FD135) and last session of the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~9:15am), then powered on the laptop and downloaded the data from the two Actiwatch Spectrums, copied the data from the 2 HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC and downloaded Cardiopres data.         [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] FE-6 Hoshide had Day 3 of his 4th (FD120) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of pH testing. After recording his diet input today, Akihiko broke out the equipment for the associated urine collections for pH value beginning tomorrow, followed by the blood sampling (fasted) on Day 5, Friday (9/14), with Pro K photography. Hoshide also conducted Part 2 of the periodic noise measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the Soyuz 31S crew, i.e., Yuri (#1003), Suni (#1004) & himself (#1005), for a 24-hr data take. In preparation for HTV-3 unberth & release with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System), FE-3 Acaba –·        Closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & Kibo windows, ·        Powered up the Lab & Cupola RWS DCPs (Robotic Workstation Display & Control Panels) to provide monitoring views, then ·        Installed the CCR (Cupola Crew Restraint) and performed hand controller calibration at each RWS release. Joe & Akihiko then completed final HTV release steps by –Disconnecting the remaining power jumper line, putting HTV on its own internal power,Installing the HTV thermal cover & Node-2 nadir center disk cover,Closing the Node-2 nadir hatch,Depressurizing the vestibule & performing leak checks for 30 min,·        Removing CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism) bolts and deploying latches, and·        Grappling the HTV with SSRMS, setting up the RWS displays & overlays at the Hot Backup RWS in the Lab for release. After HCP (HTV Control Panel) setup & checkout, next steps were –Unberthing the HTV with the SSRMS at ~7:50am EDT,Moving the HTV to the release position, and finallyReleasing it from the SSRMS at 11:50am.   FE-3 & FE-6 then –·        Monitored HTV departure by verifying IDM1 (ISS Departure Maneuver 1, ~11:56am) and IDM2 (12:06pm) burns, and Passive Abort Setting,·        Parked the SSRMS,·        Performed the usual post-MSS (Mobile Service System) operations cleanup for the LAB RWS, including disconnecting the DCP cable),·        Cleaned up the Cupola RWS (inhibiting the UOP/Utility Outlet Panel, removing the CCR) after MSS was powered down by ground commanding,·        Performed photo/video clean-up of Lab camcorder and VTR (Video Tape Recorder) Bypass Cable configuration, and·        Inhibited and temporarily stowed the HCP in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) Working in the Russian MRM2 Poisk mini-research module, FE-2 Revin experimentally removed the diffusers of two SSD305 light units (A85, A86), tried out unscrewing their M5 attachment bolts, then re-tightened the screws and re-installed the diffusers and guard screens.     [Objective: To assess the feasibility of lights removal in MRM2.]  Next, Sergei reconfigured the ASU toilet facility’s lighting setup by connecting a patch cable for a new SSD 301 lighting fixture and removing the older SD1-7 light unit, supported by ground specialist tagup via S-band. FE-2 also pre-packed an old SD1-5M light unit spare and three SD1-7 light power supply spares for disposal. Malenchenko completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~5:05pm EDT.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 8/22 & 8/23.] Using the hardware of the new Russian experiment TEKh-52 “Vizir” (Viewfinder) at SM window #6, Yuri also conducted another test run, intended to validate SKPF-U procedures plus determine equipment alignment and characterize instrument precision.     [For today’s tests, Yuri again used easily identifiable earth targets for obtaining images which will then be processed by the ground for equipment alignment and precision characterization.  Vizir employs the SKPF-U hardware, a photo image coordinate reference system using ultrasound sensors, a NIKON D3X photo camera with SIGMA AF 600mm (f/4) for detailed photography, a NIKON D3X with AF300-800mm lens for general target views, and the RSK1 laptop with new software (Vers. 3.4), installed on 8/13.] Later, Yuri performed the periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite Matryoshka-R (RBO-3-2), initializing eight Bubble dosimeters (A41, A42, A43, A44, A45, A46, A47, A48)  from new kit A08 preparatory to their recording radiation traces, deployed them at specific locations and photographed them.  Eight older detectors (6117, 6222, 6326, 6414, 6512, 6604, 6722, 6723) were then packed in their kit (A07) for return to Earth with their A23 memory card.        [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.] CDR Padalka meanwhile retrieved radiation detectors from the Matryoshka-R (RBO-3-1) spherical tissue-equivalent Fantom (“Phantom”) in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) for return to Earth, after photographing their exposure locations.     [Objective: To study the dynamics of the radiation environment in the Kibo module and the doses accumulated in the spherical phantom to improve space radiation control methods, as well as to measure the spatial & depth distribution of ionizing space radiation characterization in Kibo using the spherical tissue-equivalent Phantom.] Malenchenko performed the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from a CWC (Contingency Water Container, #1086) to the RS (Russian Segment) for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV is connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.] FE-5 Williams conducted the approximately weekly WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.     [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] For “Week 20” water sampling in Node-3, Sunita collected two samples from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Hot port – one 500 mL sample for return on Soyuz 30S for post-flight analysis and one 125 mL sample for in-flight microbiological analysis. For “Week 20” water sampling in the SM, FE-5 took two 500 mL post-flight samples for return on 30S and three 125 mL microbiological in-flight samples from the SVO-ZV and SRV-K ports.   [To save crew time, SVO-ZV samples were to be collected during the SRV-K heating cycle.] The microbial in-flight samples were subsequently prepared by Suni in the MCD (Microbial Capture Device) and CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection. Later, Williams performed the T+5d visual microbial (bacterial & fungal) analysis & data recording of surface & air samples collected by Acaba on 9/7 at selected sites in the Lab, Node-1, Node-2, Node-3, FGB, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) with the SSK (Surface Sampler Kit) and MAS (Microbial Air Sampler).       [The colony growth on the sampling slides is inspected visually after five days of incubation, using a special procedure to analyze the SSK media slides for bacterial & fungal colony growths.] Gennady took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, working from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Malenchenko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Yuri also worked with the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for CO (Carbon Monoxide), Formaldehyde and Ammonia contamination in the SM, recording the measurements.      [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C8H10), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur Dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, Ozone, Acetic Acid, Ammonia, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrous Oxides, Acetone, Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, etc.] Afterwards, FE-4 activated and took measurements with the Russian BAOK GANK Real-Time Monitoring Analyzer unit for measuring concentration of harmful contaminants in the air of the RS, leaving the system activated when finished.       [The BAOK gas analyzer, a subsystem of the SKDS Pressure Control & Atmosphere Monitoring System, determines concentrations of CH4 (methane), NH3 (ammonia), CO (carbon monoxide), HCN (hydrogen cyanide), HF (hydrofluoric acid) and NO2 (nitric oxide) from air samples using electrochemical sensors, with measurements displayed on LCD (liquid crystal display) and stored on tapes], Revin shot the periodic documentary photographs of the running educational experiment OBR-1-2/Fizika-Obrazovaniye, currently featuring the “Physics-Phase” (FAZA) demo, initiated on 8/14.  As usual, images were downlinked through the high-speed RSPI Data Transmission Radio Link, and the experiment was then closed out.      [Obrazovaniye (Education) is a suite of three educational demonstrations of physics in micro-G, viz., OBR-1-1/”Fizika-LT” (Motion), OBR-1-2/”Fizika-Faza” (Phase) and OBR-1-3/”Fizika-Otolit”.  The current “FAZA” demo studies a complete gas-liquid phase separation of fine dispersion particles in micro-G with diffusion and surface tension of the fluid.] In the DC1 Docking Compartment, Sergei continued his work on the BTKh-39 ASEPTIK experiment in the TVU-03 incubator with the “Vozdukh” (Air) air sampler #7.2 in the Russian Glavboks-S (Glovebox-S), today removing the air and surface medium samples from their Ziploc bags, taking documentary photographs of them to check for asepsis and returning them to the incubator.    [Objective of ASEPTIK: Development of methods and onboard equipment to provide aseptic conditions to conduct biotechnological experiments in a space flight.  Asepsis is the state of being free from microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, or preventing contact with microorganisms.] Later, FE-2 completed his 8th collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.      [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] Malenchenko conducted the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] Yuri also performed standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 by downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer from the HTV unberthing to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] The 30S crew, Padalka, Acaba & Revin, again had an hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which is standard pre-return procedure for homecoming crewmembers. Before Sleeptime, Malenchenko will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start a session each with the Sonokard experiment, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.  It is Yuri’s 3rd MBI-12 session.        [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  At ~2:55am EDT, Aki Hoshide powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 3:05am conducted a ham radio session with students at the Maroochydore State School, Maroochydore, Queensland, Australia. At ~8:15am, Akihiko Hoshide supported a JAXA PAO TV VIP event, responding to questions from Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Hirofumi Hirano, Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT); Motohisa Furukawa, Minister of State for Space Policy and six students, moderated by JAXA astronaut Dr. Satoshi Furukawa.     [The Prime Minister pointed out that Japan is celebrating a “Day of Space” and that today is also the 20th anniversary of the flight of the first Japanese astronaut, Mamoru Mohri, on a Space Shuttle.] At ~12:45pm, Joe Acaba had his regular weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- & Ku-band audio/video. At ~1:20pm, Joe Acaba powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment and at 1:30pm held a ham radio session with students at Mercelino Canino Canino Middle School, Doarado, Puerto Rico. The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [FE-6 & FE-5 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Suni’s protocol for today showed T2 (int., 4 min.), with ARED/CEVIS (cont.) for tomorrow.  Aki’s protocol for today showed T2 (int., 4 min.)] Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), and·        A detailed & general view photo session with TEKh-52 Vizir of the disastrous flooding which occurred overnight on 8/21-22 at the Black Sea,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andPersonal iPad setup for operation with new WPA2 through SM WAP encryption. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Minsk, Belarus (Capital Cities Collection: ISS had a mid-morning pass over the capital and largest city of Belarus. Minsk is situated on the Svislach and Niamiha Rivers and has a population of over 1.8 million people. As ISS tracked east over southern Belarus, the crew was to look far left of track to capture long lens shots of this city), Lusi Mud Vol., Java, IDN (this mud volcano site is part of the Expedition Earth and Beyond site list, which is an educational outreach program that motivates students to gain an interest in the STEM related subjects. Students are able to choose sites around the world to research, and work closely with astronaut photography to compliment that research. As ISS tracked SE over the Java Sea, the crew was to look right of track to capture these small volcanoes with a long lens), London, England (Capital Cities Collection: ISS had a near nadir pass over London, the largest metropolitan area in the European Union and, as such, one of our designated "megacities". As the crew passed over this capital city in mid-morning light, they were to look near nadir and just right of track to capture the entire city in one context shot), Tehran, Iran (Capital Cities Collection: Looking right of track for this city of 13.4 million. This great capital city contrasts with the major mountain range landscapes immediately north, and with green agricultural fields around the city), Podgorica, Montenegro (Capital Cities Collection: This small capital city of just over 150,000 is located at the confluence of the Ribnica and Moraca Rivers in the southern part of the country known as the Zeta plain.  ISS had a near nadir pass in good weather with approach from the NW.  At this time, as ISS hugged the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, the crew was to begin a nadir and just left of track mapping strip to acquire views of this challenging target), and Coast Mts., BC, Canada (ISS had a late morning pass in good weather over these beautiful snowcapped mountains rising above the forests of western British Columbia.  The glaciers here have been in a well-documented, heavy retreat for the past couple of decades even though they are located in a moist, marine environment, with heavy winter snowfalls and elevations ranging from 10,000 to 13,000 feet.  As the crew tracked ENE north of Vancouver Island, the crew was to aim near nadir for context views of this target area).
