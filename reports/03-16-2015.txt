Biolab Troubleshooting (TripleLux-B):  In order to recover smoke detection in the Biolab facility, Cristoforetti successfully Removed and Replaced (R&R) the smoke detector. She also performed an inspection of the Biolab handling mechanism shutter door. Photos were taken for evaluation by ground teams.  Ground teams have performed activation steps and verified that Biolab is go for the start of TripleLux-B operations on Thursday.
The Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES):  Cristoforetti reviewed experiment overview materials in preparation for MARES commissioning tomorrow. MARES will be used for research on musculoskeletal, biomechanical, and neuromuscular human physiology to better understand the effects of microgravity on the muscular system.
Permanent Multi-purpose Module (PMM) Relocate/Node1 (N1) Nadir Berthing Port Readiness: In preparation for PMM relocate and N1 Nadir Berthing Port readiness, Virts installed a connector cap at the NOD3O4 Rack Utility Interface Panel (UIP). He also partially installed a N3 Sample Delivery System (SDS) power cable.
Oxygen Generation Assembly (OGA) Hydrogen Sensor Remove & Replace: Virts removed and replaced the OGA Hydrogen sensor as a routine maintenance task. Following the removal of the old hydrogen sensor the crew used the Hydrogen Sensor ORU Purge Adapter (HOPA) to dry out the removed sensor in preparation for its return on SpX-6.  As part of this maintenance activity Virts also cleaned the Avionics Air Assembly (AAA) inlet.
