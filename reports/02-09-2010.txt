ISS On-Orbit Status 02/09/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Sleep shift in effect:  The crew’s workday began last evening at 5:39pm and ended this morning at 8:44am EST (see time table at bottom).  At wake-up, FE-4 Kotov began his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O2 generator.    [The filters were installed by Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  CDR Williams & FE-6 Creamer started another week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy & Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s second, donning their Actiwatches, from which to log data to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]  FE-1 Suraev had ~2 hrs for cargo transfer and stowage operations from Progress M-04M/36P.  In preparation for tomorrow’s Shuttle STS-130/20A arrival (~12:06am EST), CDR Williams performed a final atmosphere pressure check on PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3), then removed the 5-ft ISA/VAJ (Internal Sampling Adapter / Vacuum Access Jumper) to support of his subsequent pressurization and leak-checking of PMA-2, Orbiter Endeavour’s docking port, leaving the equipment connected for PMA-2 leak checking after docking.  In the US A/L (Airlock), Williams also started charging five batteries for the D2Xs cameras to be used for the RPM (R-Bar Pitch Maneuver) photography activity.    [Batteries must be charged for at least three hours. Three batteries will be used for the D2Xs camera configuration and checkout in preparation for the RPM documentation. The 4th & 5th batteries will be reserved as backup for the actual RPM.  During the RPM, the crew will photograph the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Endeavour, to be downlinked for launch debris damage assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]  Later, Jeff, Oleg & Soichi conducted a 1-hr procedures review for the RPM, followed by Williams configuring the cameras for the RPM picture-taking in the SM (Service Module).  Also in support of 20A, Jeff, TJ & Soichi –  Powered up the PCS (Portable Computer System) laptops in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), at the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) & in the A/L,Filled the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV flush water tank from Lab condensate,Removed the 1OA2 panel in the A/L as a get-ahead for the Shuttle-fed O2 setup for EVA prebreathe on FD3,Configured THC IMV (Temperature & Humidity Control /Intermodular Ventilation) diffusers in the Lab to optimize air mixing in the Lab for CO2 removal, with the additional station occupants on board,Relocated two PBA (Portable Breathing Apparatus) bottles with attached QDM (Quick-Don Mask) to the A/L in preparation for the 20A EVAs, one from JPM (#1028), the other from COL (#1019), to remain in A/L for the docked duration,Installed the Node-2 air duct for increased Shuttle ventilation, andPlaced one BPSMU (Battery Powered Speaker Microphone Unit) in the Lab.  Continuing the current round of preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Oleg worked in the MRM2 “Poisk”, cleaning its V1 & V3 fan screens and replacing the PF1 & PF2 dust filter cartridges.  Maxim meanwhile cleaned the TsV1 & TsV2 circulation fan mesh screens in the FGB.  Suraev also performed periodic maintenance on the SKO oxygen supply system of the Elektron-VM oxygen generator system.  FE-5 Noguchi conducted a functional checkout and verification of MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) pressure sensors, using a laptop terminal to collect data, with the delta-P sensors first switched from sensor 1 to sensor 2 and then back to 1, with ground commanding between setting changes.  Laptop and MSG were then shut down.  Afterwards, Soichi set up the SODI (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument) experiment hardware in the MSG, with MSG feedthroughs and MLC (MSG Laptop Computer) remaining unchanged, followed by the IVIDIL (Influence of Vibration on Diffusion in Liquids) gear, specifically the optics modules to be used by the DSC (Diffusion Soret Coefficient) experiment.   TJ Creamer collected ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) coolant samples for return to the ground from the LTL (Low Temperature Loop) in the Kibo JPM and from LTL & MTL (Moderate Temperature Loop) in Node-2.  Maxim performed maintenance on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation & Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time & date values.  In the SM, the FE-1 did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS).     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]  CDR & FE-6 had their periodic PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, TJ at ~11:34pm (2/8), Jeff at ~12:04am EST.  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).   Sleep shifting started with the Progress docking on 2/4.  On 2/6, crew wake shifted earlier, to 5:40pm EST.  20A Undock will drive Crew Wake one and a half hours earlier to 4:09pm by FD12.  This shift is accomplished by moving Crew Sleep 30 min earlier on FDs 6-10, and then again on FD11 and FD12.  Wake/Sleep table:         FD Cal GMT WAKE EST  SLEEP EST    1 8-Feb 39 5:40pm (2/07) 9:10am   2 9-Feb 40 5:39pm (2/08) 8:44am
