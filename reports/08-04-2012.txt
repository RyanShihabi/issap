ISS On-Orbit Status 08/04/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty.  At wakeup, Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Padalka, Revin, Acaba, Malenchenko, Williams & Hoshide joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Sergei, Yuri & Gennady also completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), and the grilles of the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System and SKV air conditioner in the SM. Joe conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Akihiko filled out his standard FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop).  It was Aki’s 3rd.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Afterwards, Hoshide completed Part 2 of the TCA-L PPA (Thermal Control Assembly for Low Temperature Loop / Pump Package Assembly) replacement in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) which he performed successfully yesterday.  Today, the worksite was closed out, cleaned up and the removed PPA attached to the PPA FSE (Flight Support Equipment). Sergei Revin conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~8:40am EDT, the entire crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~2:35pm, Suni Williams is scheduled for her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4). Suni conducted her session on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill with the Treadmill Kinematics protocol, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on her body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video will be downlinked via MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter).       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-Two – Week 5). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ACE (Advanced Colloids Experiment, NASA):     “Joe - Excellent job photo documenting and video recording each of the five ACE Samples. The image data you gathered for us was exactly what we needed to decide which ACE Sample to investigate first. The PI looked for the sample that has the fewest or smallest bubble(s) in its sample wells (i.e. the sample with the best chance of being mixed well). Bubbles prohibit the rotation of the stir bars in the well.  Suni - Thank you for your hard work to configure LMM for ACE and installing the ACE Sample S/N 2003. We especially appreciate the time and care you took with mixing the sample. Your diligence paid off! Using the LMM Microscope from the ground, we have determined that the sample wells were successfully mixed (i.e. the microparticles are suspended in the fluid).  We powered up FIR and LMM shortly after Suni closed the rack doors. We are currently running nine days of continuous operations to investigate how the various microparticles in this sample behave. We are successfully collecting data but have yet to analyze any data.” ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD Shielding (NASA/ASI):    On GMT160, André Kuipers successfully relocated the ALTEA instrument from Destiny to Columbus. He reconfigured the instrument in the so-called “shielding” configuration. The first measurement session has started right away, aiming at characterizing dedicated shielding tiles. On GMT201, one of the Silicon Detector Units (SDU #1) went off. This was recovered by a crew activity on GMT202. However on GMT202, SDU#2, which is the reference detector without shielding tiles, went off. Since this removes the comparison reference for the detectors with shielding tiles, this has science impact. Thank you, Joe, for performing the associated recovery activity on GMT209. Since then data from all 3 SDU’s are being received again. To date, around 47 cumulative days of measurements have been performed. Session#1 must be pursued for a minimum of 40-60 cumulative days, hence the minimum required duration on the first location has been met.       [Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):    No report.

Asian Seed 2010 (JAXA):    Returned on ULF6. BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      We have not performed operations this week.  We are still working on getting additional igniters up to ISS and it looks like this will be done by October.  This will be fine with us since we have a break in our test operations for several months to make room in the MSG for another investigation.  We will have one more day of operations (and perhaps up to two more) in August before this break.  In the meantime, we are continuing analysis of the data obtained so far.  We have been looking at the effect of nitrogen extinguishment on the flames.  It turns out that for our experiment if the flame is allowed to burn too long it becomes strong enough that our maximum nitrogen supply rate (0.5 liters per minute) is not able to completely extinguish the flame.  But if the flame has not been allowed to burn for as long a time then the nitrogen can put it out. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   “Many thanks for taking the time to review in detail the information package on BCAT-C1.  The questions asked reflect a deep understanding of the issues and the differences between BCAT-C1 and the previous versions, and an acute concern for details.  The ground team is eager to begin operations and is thrilled by your participation.  Good luck next week.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
