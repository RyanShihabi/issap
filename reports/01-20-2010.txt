ISS On-Orbit Status 01/20/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  The crew is on an abbreviated work schedule today, with sleep cycle shifting, to accommodate Soyuz TMA-16/20S relocation “fly-over” early tomorrow morning:  Wake – 1:00am – 12:00pm (1/20)Sleep –  12:00pm-8:45pm (1/20)Wake –  8:45pm-2:00pm (1/21)Sleep – 2:00pm-1:00am (1/22)  FE-1 Suraev began his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O2 generator.    [The filters were installed by Maxim on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  CDR Williams & FE-6 Creamer continued their current week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy & Light Exposure during Spaceflight), donning their Actiwatches, from which to log data to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]  At wake-up, TJ Creamer started Day 2 of his FD30 (Flight Day 30) session of the Pro K protocol, TJ’s second onboard run, performing the first urine pH spot test and later logging his diet intact of today.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]  In the SM (Service Module), FE-1 Suraev set up the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment hardware, then tested the hardware for taking structural dynamics data during tomorrow’s 20S undocking/relocation/redocking activities.  At ~ 11:50am EST, before (early) sleep time, Maxim activated the instrumentation for data taking.         [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]  Afterwards, Suraev & FE-4 Kotov had ~2 hrs set aside for finishing up preparing the new MRM2 Poisk module for the docking of the Soyuz spacecraft after its fly-over from the SM aft port.    [Activities focused on hatch opening, translation inside the module, and air duct installation.]  Also in preparation for the relocation, Williams worked with Kotov to set up and then test the TV downlink from the 20S and SM over the MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band in “streaming video” packets.  After the test, conducted with the RSCE “PingMaster” application, Soichi deactivated the A31p.    [The setup involves the designated A31p laptop at the Lab RWS for converting analog-to-digital video, the video connection from the SONY HVR-Z1J digital high-definition camcorder and the ZVK LIV Experimental Video Complex in the SM over the MPEG-2 encoder.  The KL-211 MPEG-2 Encoder uses the RSS1 A31p laptop (for monitoring the digital video) and a U.S. SSC (Station Support Computer) A31p laptop (for converting analog TV from Russian PAL mode to U.S. NTSC).  The video hardware connection is checked with a network ping test.  The digital video transmission is carried over JSL(Joint Station LAN)/Ethernet plus OCA/Ku-Band to MCC-Houston and from there to Moscow via the ESA Gateway for COL-CC/Oberpfaffenhofen transmission to TsUP-Moscow, plus transfer of the USOS analog video of the RS ISS video downlink via Streambox 2 to NISN (i.e., the Moscow Ostankino communication hub).]  Noguchi powered up the hardware for the SpaceDRUMS (Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix) experiment for the first time, previously set up by Creamer.  Several hours later, the equipment was turned off again.    [SpaceDRUMS suspends a solid or liquid sample using 20 acoustic beam emitters during combustion or heat-based synthesis.  Materials can be produced in microgravity with an unparalleled quality of shape and composition.  SpaceDRUMS will support scientific understanding of processes like combustion synthesis and self-propagating high temperature synthesis and also provide direct commercial benefits from materials processing.  Advanced ceramics, polymer, and colloids can be processed in SpaceDRUMS.]  In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), with the air loop deactivated by the ground, Creamer inspected and cleaned (with vacuum cleaner) the OSS2 (Optical Smoke Sensor 2) in the port cone, deckside.    [Its mounting clamp was replaced with the spare clamp prepositioned yesterday on the RGSH (Return Grid Sensor Housing) and the failed clamp stowed.]  Also for the relocation, CDR Williams installed the alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab to protect the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) from structural dynamics disturbances.  In the Lab, FE-5 Noguchi performed IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the MCS SIGI GPS-2 (Motion Control System / Space Integrated GPS/Inertial Navigation System / Global Positioning System 2), upgrading the Honeywell receiver firmware, the GSFC (Goddard Space Flight Center) attitude firmware and the Trimble firmware, loading from SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) as A31p laptop.    [The upgrade allows for 12-channel relative navigation calculations.  To access the GPS-2 at the LAB1D2 position, Soichi may have had to temporarily remove the Kabin enclosure of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment).  GPS-1 was upgraded by Jeff Williams on 1/8.]  Later, Noguchi removed the Lab WHC PT (Pretreat Tank) and replaced it with a new unit, pre-positioned nearby by Williams on 1/18.  Jeff & TJ set up and configured the DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) software application, then reviewed the upcoming PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3) relocation operations from Node-1 portside to Node-2 zenith on 1/23 (Saturday).    [DOUG is a software program on the MSS (Mobile Service System) RWS laptops that provides a graphical birdseye-view image of the external station configuration and the SSRMS arm, showing its real-time location and configuration on a laptop during its operation.]  Afterwards, at ~3:55am, Williams & Creamer conducted a 30-min teleconference with robotics specialists on the ground to discuss PMA-3 relocation operations.  Working in the SM on the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, the FE-4 reconfigured cabling by switching the BSK-5V1 power cables feeding the N2 pump on the 3SPN1 pump panel.     [This activity pursuant to a health check performed by Suraev late last year (12/24) on the power circuit of the 3SPN1 condensate pump (N2), using coolant jumpers and the Elektronika MMTs-01 Multimeter for continuity/resistance measurements.]  Jeff conducted the periodic status & screen check on the running payload CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus), located in the ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2).     [CGBA-5 is currently activated for DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) activities that are acting as a test bed for NASA HQ-sponsored communications research.  DTN software transmits messages between ISS and Mission Control Centers, and most of its operations run from the ground.  The DTN software sends CGBA-5 payload data to the ground, and automatic acknowledgement messages are generated by the ground to be passed back to the payload.]  Later, the CDR performed a label change on CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine) #1074, changing its content designation from “Technical” to “Condensate” after yesterday’s condensate pumping.   In the A/L (Airlock), Jeff terminated the ongoing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) battery recharge in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly).  Creamer powered down the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox).  TJ also initiated (later terminated) another 5-hr sampling run (the 63rd) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer).  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.    [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]  At ~10:50am EST, Oleg Kotov again took orbital photography of the Haiti disaster area, as in previous days.  Noguchi supported ground-commanded troubleshooting of the SSRMS Hot B/U (Backup) at 8:40am-11:55am by throwing switches at each RWS (Robotic Workstation), first at 9:25am, then at 11:55am.  FE-5 & FE-6 had their periodic PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, TJ at ~9:00am, Soichi at ~10:35am EST.    [CDR, FE-1 & FE-4 had their PMCs yesterday.]  The crewmembers worked out on a reduced (1-hr) physical exercise schedule on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).  IWIS Reprogrammed:    At 10:27am, for ~15 min, the ground reprogrammed the onboard Internal Wireless Instrumentation System for the Soyuz Relocate.    [IWIS monitors dynamic/vibrational responses of the ISS structure during dockings, undockings and other disturbances, measured by RSUs (Remote Sensor Units) which transmit their measurements via radio to the central NCU (Network Control Unit).  Structural vibration data are also taken by the SDMS (Structural Dynamic Measurement System).]  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Moroni, Comoros (this capital city is located on the western coastline of the island of Grande Comore.  The city has served as the capital since 1958.  Looking slightly to the right of track for the Comoros archipelago and Moroni; overlapping mapping frames of the urban area were requested), Mumbai, India Aerosol (looking to the right of track towards the Mumbai, India metropolitan region for pollution masses and layers in the atmosphere above the city.  There should have been little to no water clouds present, so any visible cloud masses should have been due to human activities.  Researchers are particularly interested in photography of the margins of any distinct pollution masses and distinct atmospheric layering.  It is also important to include geographic landmarks - such as the coastline - in the image frames so that the pollution masses can be located), Asmara, Eritrea (ISS had a nadir-viewing pass over this capital city which is located on the northwestern edge of the Great Rift Valley and the Eritrean highlands.  Overlapping mapping frames of the city, taken along track, were requested.  The city does not contrast greatly with its surroundings, so the crew was to start mapping photography as ISS approached the target, continuing as it passed over it), B.P. Structure, Impact Crater, Libya (ISS had a nadir-viewing pass over this small [2 km in diameter] impact structure.  The circular structure of the crater is distinctive amongst the nearby ridges and hills.  The crew was to begin taking overlapping nadir-viewing mapping frames as it approached the target area - and continuing as it passed over - to obtain imagery of the crater), Planchon-Peteroa Volcano, Chile (Dynamic Event. Planchon-Peteroa, a stratovolcano located near the Chile-Argentina border, has resumed eruptive activity in the form of ash emissions.  The volcano last erupted in 1998.  Looking to the right of track for the elongated volcano, located due south of the Santiago urban area.  Overlapping frames of the volcano - and any ash plumes, if present – were requested), and Santiago, Chile (weather was predicted to be clear over the capital city of Chile.  Overlapping nadir-viewing mapping frames, taken along track, will provide a rural-urban-rural transect across the urban area that is useful for assessing land cover and land use patterns).
