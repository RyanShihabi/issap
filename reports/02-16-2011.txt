ISS On-Orbit Status 02/16/11  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sleep shift:    Today:   Wake – 11:50pm EST last night; Sleep – 7:30pm tonight Tomorrow:  Wake – 5:00am; Sleep – 4:30pm (returning to normal)  The Russian Orlan EVA-28 by FE-4 Dmitri Kondratyev (EV1) & FE-2 Oleg Skripochka (EV2) concluded successfully at 1:21pm EST, with a total duration of 4h 51m (begin: 8:30am).  It was the third EVA to utilize the Orlan telemetry via S-Band matching unit, instead of executing the EVA on VHF over RGS (Russian Ground Sites).  Tasks completed by the spacewalkers were –  Installation & connection of the Molniya-GAMMA monoblock (unit) on the URM-D portable multipurpose work platform on Plane IV of the SM RO 2 (Work Compartment/l.d. [large diameter]); Installation, connection & deployment of the new RK-21-8 SVCh-Radiometriya experiment system on URM-D on Plane II of SM RO/l.d., followed by successful deployment of the unit’s antenna in operational configuration, Removal of two Komplast panels (#2, #10) from the FGB (Funktsional’no-gruzovoj blok) and their insertion into their air-tight container; andRemoval of the Yakor foot restraint (Ferrozond) from its location on the SM RO/l.d.  The Yakor was jettisoned; three other items were brought back inside (Molniya MLI, Komplast, and protective cover).    Before breakfast & first exercise, FE-2 Skripochka & FE-4 Kondratyev took a full session each with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis.  A second session followed after crew ingress.  Afterwards, Oleg closed out and stowed the Urolux hardware.      [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).]  FE-1 Kaleri conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Alex will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Also at wake-up, Kaleri terminated his 11th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]   CDR Kelly continued his current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy & Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Scott’s 8th session, transferring data from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, US crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]  Other activities completed by Scott Kelly as last preparations for the spacewalk before his isolation in the MRM2 module were –  Conducting another module data collection session on the CubeLab and transferring files of collected data to laptop for downlink  [CubeLab is a low-cost 1-kg platform for educational projects.  It is a multipurpose research facility that interfaces small standard modules into the ERs (EXPRESS Racks).  The modules can be used within the pressurized space station environment in orbit, with a nominal length, width, and height of 100 mm and a mass of no more than 1 g.  Up to 16 CubeLab modules can be inserted into a CubeLab insert inside an ER],Performing a final test on the two NIKON D2Xs EVA cameras for Oleg & Dmitri,Inhibiting the CUCU (COTS UHF Communications Unit) in the Lab (at O4) by opening four circuit breakers, andGathering last equipment items from stowage for EVA-28, including relocating the SSC6 T61p laptop from Node-2 to MRM2 in preparation for operations during his isolation.   FE-1 Kaleri initiated his 4th session of the PZE MO-2 protocol, today for an abbreviated run lasting 13h 40min (instead of the usual 24h).     [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Alex doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads and recorded on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then to be downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data will be downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]  In preparing the RS (Russian Segment) for the spacewalk by shutting down selected systems, Kaleri also shut SM windows (##12-14, #6, ##8-9) and then supported TsUP-Moscow in deactivating the Elektron O2 generator (~3:15am).  As part of the standard deactivation process Sasha purged the Elektron with N2 (nitrogen), controlled from laptop.  Also preparatory to the spacewalk, Alex activated & verified proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in MRM2 for taking structural dynamics data during EVA.  Later, FE-1 downlinked the measurement data to the ground and shut off DAKON.      [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]  After setting up the MRM2 “Poisk” module for their lockout, Kaleri removed the air ducts from the DC1 (leaving the V3 fan in place) and MRM2.  At ~6:25am, Scott Kelly entered MRM2 for his 8h 40m isolation period during the spacewalk, joined by Alex Kaleri at ~8:00am (for 6h 25m).  FE-5 Nespoli and FE-6 Coleman were sequestered in the USOS with access to FGB/MRM1/25S.  Progress 39P was prepared for unscheduled (contingency) undocking if required.  During his lockout, Kelly prepared the T61p laptop for first USB video use by building video device cabling which he connected and taped to a T61p USB adapter.    [The cabling was later stowed along with the assemblies created during the Russian EVA-27 (required for Service Pack Deployment for SSCs/Station Support Computers).]  Nespoli closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) science windows.  After conclusion of EVA-28 at 1:21pm, Oleg & Dmitri –  Repressurized the SM PkhO transfer compartment,   Conducted their second MO-9 “Urolux” biochemical urine test,Reset STTS communications in the SM/PkhO,Re-installed the air duct through the PkhO hatch,Restored systems configurations in the SM to pre-EVA conditions, andSet up the Orlan-MK suits, gloves, umbilicals and BSS interface units for drying out.    FE-1 Kaleri, who had remained isolated in the MRM2 during EVA-28 with Scott Kelly, –  Opened the MRM2-to-SM(SU) hatches,   Installed the air ducts in SM, MRM2 and DC1,Supported the ground-commanded reactivation of the Russian Elektron O2 generator (~4:10pm) by monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating  [the gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H2) in the O2 line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup], andConducted post-EVA MRM2 reconfiguration to nominal.  FE-5 Nespoli completed Session 1/Day 6 of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment, i.e., high-salt diet.  Today’s activities involved taking measurements of body mass (BMM) with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device), final urine sampling after the 24-hr collections, and securing their blood samples in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Special diet intake & logging was not required.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Wheels & Shannon are ingesting special diet (for Wheels: Session 1 – Low salt diet; Session 2 – High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level; for Shannon: first High salt, then Low salt).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]  Nespoli & Coleman had ~30 min for the standard Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) onboard familiarization training, their 3rd, using a NIKON D2Xs digital still camera with 400mm (FE-6) & 800mm (FE-5) lenses to take in-cabin target imagery using an Orbiter tile diagram.        [The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the next Shuttle (STS-133/Discovery/ULF5), to be launched 2/24/11.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Discovery, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]  Other tasks completed by Paolo Nespoli included –  Initiating another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer) and deactivating the system ~5 hrs later  [this was the 19th session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],Readying US GSCs (Grab Sample Containers, #2050, #2058) for first ingress in ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2)   [Russian equipment needed for ingress will be scheduled separately],Checking the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) pulleys by measuring the full range of motion of the exercise ropes,Activating the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory and inserting the PCMCIA memory card with the data of Scott Kelly’s recent (2/15) PASSAGES session for subsequent downlink (later terminated and stowed),Identifying and marking all 13 mesh bags (3x5) in MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) for easier separation on the ground, assisted by Cady Coleman,Retightening the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer w/Vibration Isolation & Stabilization) crank handle to its proper torque setting,Conducting the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks),Relocating the SAMS SE (Space Acceleration Measurement System Sensor Enclosure) and its associated cable in COL from loc. D3 to the FSL ODM (Fluids Science Laboratory Optical Diagnostic Module) seat track, andDegassing PWRs (Payload Water Reservoirs, #1003, #1025, #1026) in the US Airlock for use during ULF5, i.e., manually removing gas bubbles (by self-centrifugation) to minimize the amount of air introduced into the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit).  After adjusting the VCA2 (Video Camera Assembly 2) to cover his activities, Nespoli also set up the new ESA EPO (Educational Payload Operation) Greenhouse in COL, first installing two growth chambers containing Arabidopsis (Rockcress, related to mustard in the Brassicaceae plant family) and lettuce seeds, then activating the hardware with the lettuce seeds.      [Using the MultiMeter temperature probe, Paolo had to determine the optimum distance of the GH (Greenhouse) from the MUL (Module Lighting Unit).  GH temperature should be between 20-24 degC.  If it was higher than 24 degC, the GH was to be moved further away, but not beyond 50 cm.]   FE-6 Coleman retrieved & stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies, deployed by Scott Kelly on 2/14 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.      [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]  After yesterday’s regular WRS (Water Recovery System) sample analysis with the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer) in Node-3, Coleman today conducted the periodic TOCA calibration check.  Later, FE-6 went through a CBT (computer-based training) course on HRF2 PFS (Human Research Facility 2 / Pulmonary Function System) operations, then set up the PFM/PAM (Pulmonary Function Module/Photoacoustic Analyzer Module) and GDS (Gas Delivery System) and powered the hardware on for a thorough health check, with the ground monitoring via real-time telemetry.  Afterwards, Cady turned the equipment off and disassembled it for stowage.  Other activities completed by Cady Coleman were –  Gathering & temporarily stowing the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) Pretreat Tank with EDV and KTO container hardware until required next Monday, 2/21,Installing the FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack) alignment guides to lock down the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) as protection against disturbances, and taking documentary photography,Relocating the bundled EMUs #3005 & #3009 plus the PDGF (Power & Data Grapple Fixture) from the US Airlock to the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) in preparation for ULF5 plus taking photos, andWorking in Node-2 to remove the nadir port vestibule W6005 power jumper (Channel 2) and then use it to build the W6005 contingency power jumper for the zenith vestibule, in preparation for HTV2 relocation to the latter   [the HTV contingency jumpers provide power from the Node-2 Fwd Ovhd bulkhead to HTV2.  Ready-made cables for this nadir-zenith-nadir berthing scenario (for providing sufficient clearance for STS-133 docking to Node-2 Fwd) are currently in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), to be launched on ULF-5.]  FE-1 Kaleri conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]  Before sleeptime, Oleg Skripochka will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 12th Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  Scott, Paolo & Cady worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Buenos Aires, Argentina (the Argentine capital is located on the southwest coast of the large, turbid, Rio de la Plata estuary and near the mouth of the Parana River.  ISS approach was from the NW at mid-morning with clear weather expected.  At this time the crew was to begin looking just right of track for this metropolitan area of about 13 million.  CEO researchers are seeking a context view that acquires most or all of the urban area in a single frame), Wellington, New Zealand (the capital city of New Zealand is located on a small bay off Cook Strait near the southern tip of North Island.  ISS had a fine fair-weather pass in mid-morning light today.  As it tracked over the strait between North and South Islands, the crew was to look near nadir for this port city of nearly 400,000.  CEO researchers are seeking near-nadir views that capture the urban area in a single frame), and Melbourne, Australia (ISS had a fine mid-morning pass in fair weather over Australia’s second largest city of just over 4 million.  This target is rarely requested due to low light and routine crew sleep constraints.  As ISS approached the coast of southeastern Australia, the crew was to look for the sizeable Port Phillip Bay.  Melbourne is situated on the northern part the bay.  CEO researchers are seeking nadir views which capture the urban area in a single frame).
