RS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #56: During preparations for today’s Russian EVA, both the primary and backup cooling pumps on EV1’s Orlan showed unstable behavior. After unsuccessful attempts at troubleshooting, the EVA has been cancelled. The European Robotic Arm (ERA) has been returned to its stowed configuration, and the crew and ground teams are backing out of the EVA-specific configurations. Ground teams are also assessing future troubleshooting and EVA opportunities.
Payloads:
Food Physiology: A diet briefing was attended between the crew and Principal Investigator team in support of the Food Physiology investigation. The Integrated Impact of Diet on Human Immune Response, the Gut Microbiota, and Nutritional Status During Adaptation to Spaceflight (Food Physiology) experiment is designed to characterize the key effects of an enhanced spaceflight diet on immune function, the gut microbiome, and nutritional status indicators. These factors are interlinked, but diet is the only one that can be easily and meaningfully altered on Earth or during flight. This investigation aims to document the effect of dietary improvements on human physiology and the ability of those improvements to enhance adaptation to spaceflight.
