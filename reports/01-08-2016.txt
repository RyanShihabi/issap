Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Status:  Following yesterday’s pretreated urine leak discovery and cleanup, today Peake worked to successfully change out the WHC Pump Separator, Wring Collector (COT), Air Filter, Liquid Indicator and Electrical cables.  WHC has since been activated and is operating nominally.
 
Robotics Refueling Mission (RRM):  Last night, ground controllers transferred RRM Task Board 4 and Robotic Micro Conical Tool (RMCT)-1 from the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to the JEM Airlock Slide Table.  Peake then retracted the slide table back into the JEM Airlock.  Taskboard 4 and RMCT1 are planned for return on SpX-8.
 
Biological Rhythms 48 Hours:  Today Kopra removed the Holter Electrocardiogram and transfer data from the Holter and Acitwatch to the Medical laptop.  This JAXA investigation studies the effects of long-term microgravity exposure on heart function by analyzing an astronaut’s electrocardiogram for 48 hours. While the ISS schedule follows Greenwich Mean Time, it is not known whether a separate biological rhythm is imposed on long-term flight crews. To study this, astronauts wear an Actiwatch for 96 hours and a Holter electrocardiograph for 48 hours.
 
Fluid Shifts Before, During and After Prolonged Space Flight and Their Association with Intracranial Pressure and Visual Impairment (Fluid Shifts):  Kornienko continued his Return-45 (R-45) multi-day session with baseline imaging collection, including Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE), Tonometry, and Ultrasounds.  Kelly assisted him as the operator.  Fluid Shifts investigates the causes for severe and lasting physical changes to astronaut’s eyes. Because the headward fluid shift is a hypothesized contributor to these changes, reversing this fluid shift with a lower body negative pressure device is investigated as a possible intervention. Results from this study may help to develop preventative measures against lasting changes in vision and eye damage.
 
Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study (Sprint) Volume of Oxygen Utilized (VO2) Max:  For his Flight Day 15 Sprint VO2 Max session, Kopra attached Electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes to himself, set up and donned Heart Rate Monitor hardware, performed Portable Pulmonary Function System calibrations, and then performed the VO2 protocol.  The Sprint VO2 investigation evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in ISS crewmembers while reducing total exercise time during long-duration space missions.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation:  In preparation for the Sequential Shunt Unit (SSU) EVA next Friday, Peake and Kopra performed a checkout of the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) System and configured EVA tools.
 
Elektron Status:  Ground Specialists in Moscow worked with the Russian Crew to troubleshoot Elektron today. The crew flushed the Elektron primary and backup pumps with water and ensured various valves were configured correctly, and successfully activated the system.  Elektron had been deactivated since December 24th for the high beta period.
