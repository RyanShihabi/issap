ISS On-Orbit Status 06/29/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Light-duty days for the crew: Sleep cycle shift to accommodate Sunday morning’s Soyuz 29S undocking (12:48am EDT):·        Wake 1 (this morning):  2:00am·        Nap:                             10:00am·        Wake 2 (today):             2:00pm·        Sleep (today):                 9:30pm·        Wake 2 (tomorrow):       1:00pm·        Undock (Sunday, 7/1):  12:48am·        Sleep (Sunday, 7/1):       5:00am·        Sleep/Rest:  21 hrs·        Wake 3 (7/2):                 2:00am (normal) After wakeup, Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Joe Acaba completed his (currently daily) sleep-shift session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, his 13th time.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking & brushing teeth, André Kuipers & Don Pettit performed their 4th liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 5).  The collections are made every other day for six days.  After the midday “nap” (10:00am-2:00pm), FE-5 & FE-6 also collected their associated blood samples.  Acaba took documentary photography, and Kuipers stowed the samples, along with the liquid & dry saliva specimen, for return to Earth on 29S.        [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] After inspecting and then activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility (later deactivating it), Don Pettit adjusted the video camera and conducted another session with the BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids) experiment by conducting two flame test runs on samples, exchanging burner tubes between each test point, exchanging the digital tapes in the MSG VTR1 (Video Tape Recorder 1) & VTR2 and at the end performing a fan calibration to evaluate the air flow with the new fan flow constrictor installed.        [BASS uses SLICE equipment but burns solid fuel samples instead of gaseous jets.  Sample will either be ignited one time and then replaced with a new one, or burn multiple times.  The four servicing procedures, ops prep, BASS ops, BASS fan calibration & BASS videotape exchange, are now no longer listed separately on the crew timeline but consolidated in one activity.  BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity.  It will also guide strategies for extinguishing accidental fires in micro-G.  Results will contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in space and on Earth.] Joe Acaba meanwhile had 4.5 hrs to perform maintenance on three EVA PGTs (Extra Vehicular Activity Pistol Grip Tools, #1007, #1008, #1002), installing the TAK (Torque Analyzer Kit) on each PGT to record PGT output torque values for ground analysis, preceded by reviewing a training video for TAK installation. FE-2 Revin had another 1h 45m for stowing excessed equipment and trash on Progress 47P for disposal. In preparation for his return to gravity early Sunday morning (12:48am EDT), CDR Kononenko undertook Part 2 of his 5th and final exercise/training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the TVIS treadmill.  Medical telemetry monitoring on the ground was at 5:04am.  The activity was then closed out and the Chibis-M equipment cleaned up.    [The assessments, lasting one hour each, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground sites, uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis-M ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -30, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each, then -25, -30, and -40 mmHg (Torr) for 10 min. each plus -30mmHg for 5 min. while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis-M suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] Afterwards, Kononenko conducted the MO-22 Sanitary-Epidemiological Status check, part of the Russian MedOps program done on structures and crewmembers usually before Soyuz departures.       [To monitor for microflora, Oleg collected samples from surface areas of interior panels and hardware at numerous locations in the SM, FGB, MRM1, MRM2, DC1 and ATV-3, also from himself, FE-1 Padalka & FE-2 Revin using cotton swabs and special test tubes which were then stowed in 28S for return to the ground.] Later, the CDR also used the standard ECOSFERA equipment to conduct microbial air sampling runs, Part 2, for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment, with the POTOK Air Purification System temporarily powered down, taking Kit 2 samples from cabin surfaces along with samples from crewmembers for sanitation and disease studies.  The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container and subsequently packed for return in Soyuz 29S.     [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger, power supply unit, and incubation tray for Petri dishes, determines microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge at one given time, the sample collection must be performed in two stages.] FE-1 Padalka underwent his first Russian blood chemistry analysis test PZE MO-11, assisted by Dr. Kuipers as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) for the phlebotomy.  The exam was performed with the kits and accessories of the Reflotron-4 blood analyzer and supported by tagup with ground specialists.      [Earlier Reflotron versions have operated already on space station Mir.  For the test, Padalka imbibed 250 ml of warm water or plain (unsweetened) tea, after which fresh blood was drawn from his finger with an Autoclix mini-lancet and a Reflotron pipette.  Clinical data were then determined from the collected sample.  Using various reagent tabs, the blood is tested with strips (KPI) for such parameters as hemoglobin, glucose, bilirubin, amylase, uric acid, triglycerides, urea, creatinin, cholesterol, etc.  The tubes with blood samples were temporarily kept cool for the subsequent (post-breakfast) analysis.  Reflotron-4 uses 40 W of power, supplied by the Service Module’s electrical system.] Kuipers also deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.      [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] Afterwards, André started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.       [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] In view of his departure on 7/1, Kuipers, a physician by profession, removed the batteries from the laryngoscope in the Physician Equipment Pack and restowed the instrument.      [After joining the ISS crew last year, André had installed two AA batteries in the handle of the laryngoscope for preparedness.  A laryngoscope is a viewing instrument for tracheal intubation and inspection of the larynx, e.g., the vocal folds and glottis.  It consists of a handle containing batteries with a light source and a set of interchangeable blades.] André also collected air samples with new GSCs (Grab Sample Containers) in the Lab (#2114) and Kibo JPM (#2110), sequenced with the AQM sampling for postflight comparison.      [GSC samples are taken 1-3 hrs after AQM start.] Don Pettit worked on cleaning up HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) equipment, both personal and medical items, that needed to be consolidated & stowed before his return to earth.     [Going by an uplinked listing, Don either trashed or stowed for return personal medical items such as medications needed prior to undock and for the landing process, eyewear, earwear, etc..] After configuring the usual pumping equipment (Compressor-M, A8A hose, adapters), Sergei Revin used about 4-5 liters of water from an EDV-OR (#1004) container to flush the transfer connection to the BV1 Rodnik tank of Progress M-15M/47P, docked at DC-1 nadir, readying the equipment for subsequent bladder check and urine transfer activities.      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.] Later, Sergei conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Working from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, FE-1 took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Also before the midday snack/nap, FE-2 started charging the TTM2 battery for the BAR KPT-2 experiment. At ~4:15am EDT, with ISS Command being transferred tonight from Kononenko to Padalka for Increment 31/32, with Sergei Revin & Joe Acaba as Flight Engineers, Oleg & Gennady signed two copies of the formal Russian Handover Protocol document certifying RS (Russian Segment) handover/acceptance, including the contents of Progress 47P (#415), currently docked at DC-1 nadir, MRM1 Rassvet, and MRM2 Poisk.       [The first copy remains on ISS, the second copy will be returned to the ground on Soyuz TMA-03M.  “We, the Undersigned, have executed this Protocol to the effect that Oleg Dmitriyevich Kononenko, responsible for ISS-30/31 RS, handed over the ISS RS, and Gennady Ivanovich Padalka, a crew member in charge of the ISS-31/32 RS, accepted the ISS RS, including special operating features, onboard system or equipment anomalies”]  Later in the day, after the 4-hr nap, the crew worked an additional 7h 30m (2:00pm-9:30pm): Kononenko worked in the TMA-03M spacecraft’s Orbital Module (BO), disconnecting & taking out the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit, for stowage and recycling in a future vehicle. Afterwards, Oleg had another ~4 hrs for carefully packing & loading cargo on Soyuz 29S, based on a consolidated final loading manifest consisting of two parts.     [Part 1: a certificate of the returned equipment transfers, prepared by the crew during pre-pack activities (stow locations, quantity updates) and to be handed to the cargo representative at the landing site.  Part 2: charts showing containers and equipment layout in the SA Descent Capsule, supplemented with recommendations on items stowage and dunnage in the SA (i./e., materials, incl. containers, used in the capsule to protect goods and their packaging from moisture, contamination and mechanical damage.] FE-1 Padalka collected the regular air samples for return on 29S, using a Russian AK-1M absorber in the SM for air, plus IPD-CO Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (Carbon Monoxide) and subsequently also for NH3 (Ammonia). FE-2 Revin prepared three Russian bioengineering payloads for return – BTKh-29 Zhenshen-2 (Ginseng-2), BTKh-8 BIOTREK and BTKh-41 BAKTERIOFAG, first taking documentary photography of them, then dismantling their BIOEKOLOGIYA cases and transferring them to Soyuz 29S SA.  With the KPT-2 TTM-2 battery freshly charged in the morning, Padalka & Revin used the KPT-2 payload suite of BAR science instruments, with Piren-V and TTM-2, for another 2h session of conducting air temperature and humidity monitoring, today behind SM panels 202, 204, 205, 402, 404 and PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel) to fill the mapped database to populate the mapped RS data base.       [KPT-2 monitors problem areas, necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data are copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities are supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer / thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] As part of the recent investigation of the DECLIC (Device for the Study of Critical Liquids & Crystallization) payload at the ER-7 (EXPRESS Rack 7) in the Lab, FE-5 Kuipers today uncabled & removed the two DECLIC lockers from ER-7 and relocated them with their cabling to ER-4 where they replaced two stowage lockers which he then moved from ER-4 and installed in ER-7.        [DECLIC had been transferred with its power & data cables from ER-4 to a locker in ER-7 on 4/16 by Dan Burbank.  The French (CNES)/NASA-sponsored DECLIC is a multi-user facility to investigate low & high temperature critical fluids behavior, chemical reactivity in supercritical water, directional solidification of transparent alloys, and more generally transparent media under micro-gravity environment. Activities to be completed by FE-6 Pettit after the midday snack/nap included –·        Servicing the NanoRacks in the Lab, activating mixing tube 9 in Module-9 for the last time and stowing Module-9 for return on 29S;·        Filling out his 19th FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer);   [on the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily];·        Closing the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows to prevent their contamination from thruster effluents during the upcoming undock maneuvers;·        Having a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC;  [required are three journaling sessions per week]; and·        Turning on, before Presleep, the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again;   [this is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Joe Acaba performed troubleshooting on the ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera) laptop failure.     [Activities included manually powering the laptop on while on internal battery power, correcting BIOS settings, disconnecting/reconnecting the Firewire cable and checking circuit breaker status.] Joe also had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC. Before sleeptime, Acaba will configure onboard C&T (Communications & Tracking) for his Node-2 CQ (Crew Quarters) as the new “On-Call” crewmember by connecting the Node-2 port-side ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) #15 and verifying speaker functionality. At ~4:15am EDT, Kononenko, Padalka, Revin & Kuipers held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Main Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~7:55am Don Pettit had his pre-descent PMC (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video. At ~9:40am, before the nap, the crew had a teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office/CB (Peggy Whitson), via S-band S/G-2 audio & phone patch. At ~3:30pm, Joe held the regular IMS (Inventory Management System) stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists. At ~7:35pm tonight, all six crewmembers will join up for the traditional “Change of Command” ceremony, officially marking the transfer of the baton from Increment 31 to Increment 32, with Gennady Padalka taking over Command from Oleg Kononenko who temporarily will become FE-4. At ~7:55pm, the crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-2).       [FE-6 was on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise was being timelined for Fridays.]  Tasks listed for Kononenko, Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (31-0005I) lists 14 CWCs (241.1 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (4 CWCs with 191.9 L; plus 1 empty bag);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (3 CWCs with 55.5 L); and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] JPM TCA-L PPA Update:   Through Joe Acaba’s troubleshooting efforts on the TCA-L PPA (Thermal Control Assembly for Low Temperature Loop / Pump Package Assembly) in the Kibo laboratory, ground engineers have determined that the PPA appears to have failed due to a possible electrical short.  A spare unit will be arriving on HTV3 (H-2 Transfer Vehicle 3).  A configuration has been developed to berth HTV3 if the next failure of the second TCA loop goes down, losing cooling in the JPM.  JAXA is estimating 7 hrs of crew time after HTV3 berthing to replace the pump. MELFI Repair Success:   The crew was congratulated on yesterday’s “great job” to restore the critically needed MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) by replacing its failed EU (Electronics Unit)  with a spare EU from MELFI-3.
