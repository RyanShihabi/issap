In Flight Maintenance (IFM) Crew Quarters (CQ) Cleaning – Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Nyberg cleaned the overhead CQ intake and exhaust ducts, fan and flow sensors. This routine maintenance was performed in preparation for the arrival of new ISS crewmembers later this month.
Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Emulsions (InSPACE)-3 Experiment Runs:  FE-5 Parmitano completed InSPACE-3 runs 19 through 22 today out of a total of 42 runs planned as part of this experiment series.  InSPACE-3 studies the behavior of magnetic colloidal fluids which transition to a solid-like state by the formation and cross-linking of microstructures in the presence of a magnetic field. This technology can be used for vibration damping systems and can improve the design of structures. 
Cygnus Pregather – Parmitano and Nyberg continue gathering disposal items in preparation for Orbital Demo 1 berthing, currently scheduled for 22 September 2013. The items are being stowed temporarily at the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) Endcone.
