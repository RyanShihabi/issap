Russian Treadmill (БД-2) Checkout: Flight Engineer (FE)-2 Misurkin performed checkout of the new Russian treadmill. The crew was able to run on the БД-2 and downlinked photos and a video of the session to ground specialists for evaluation. The crew is scheduled to start nominal exercise sessions on Friday.
Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Zero Robotics:  FE-3 Cassidy performed a SPHERES Zero Robotics session in preparation for the August Zero Robotics Middle School final competition. The SPHERES Zero Robotics program provides middle and high school students the opportunity to develop algorithms for SPHERES and to design software to accomplish complex tasks in space such as docking, assembly and formation flight.

Backup Control Center (BCC) Internet Protocol (IP) Phone Test:  In preparation for the start of Houston’s hurricane season on June 1, Cassidy attempted to perform an IP Phone Test with the BCC Flight Control Team at the Huntsville Operations Support Center (HOSC) but was unsuccessful. This is a new capability added to BCC this year. Ground teams are working this issue.
