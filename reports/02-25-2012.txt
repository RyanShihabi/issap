ISS On-Orbit Status 02/25/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – Crew off duty. After breakfast, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-5 Kuipers continued his 3rd (FD60) Pro K session with Day 3 for a 5-day period, with diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  After recording his diet input today, André broke out and set up the equipment for the associated urine collections tomorrow (2/26).  Blood sampling will follow on Monday (2/27).       [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD370, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15th day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 & 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.] Dan Burbank conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.       [Crew note from Dan:  “Good status checks; both units have incrementing GMT and temps (set and actual) match.”] CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov, FE-2 Ivanishin, FE-4 Kononenko, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP). Also as part of uborka, FE-6 Pettit used the vacuum cleaner to remove any dust and debris from the vents of the OpsLAN Server T61p SSCs (Station Support Computers) located in Lab bay O1 (LS1 & ISS-SERVER1) to ensure their optimal performance. Anatoly Ivanishin checked the KOB2 cooling loop in the SM, at a liquid connector on the 4SPN2 panel for coolant leaks.     [In case there were any large droplets (10-20 cm3), FE-2 was to report to TsUP-Moscow.] Oleg Kononenko meanwhile performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Dan Burbank took the (approx.) monthly O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, his 3rd, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.        [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There has been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.] Dan & André filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Dan’s 13h, André’s 7th.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] The CDR had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] At ~7:35am EST, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. FE-1, FE-2 & FE-4 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Anton at ~5:10am, Anatoly at ~6:45am, Oleg at ~9:05am EST. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycled ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).     [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2, with CEVIS, ARED+T2, T2, ARED+T2, CEVIS following in the next 4 days.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty/Thirty-One -- Week 23). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):    The experiment is continuing in Dewar 4 of MELFI-1.

BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):     Sample 4 ran from 2/8 – 2/22.  The latest images in the sequence do not appear to have any of the particular phase separation, called spinodal decomposition, that we saw in the other samples.  We will be looking into the complete set of data.  Having a BCAT sample that is at or beyond the critical point actually sets a boundary in the phase diagram for the Harvard BCAT samples; this is exciting from a science perspective.        [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.

CFE-2 (Capillary Flow Experiment 2, NASA):     “Don: Today (2/23) you conducted a full 360° CCW rotation of the vane for the CFE Vane Gap-2 vessel. The purpose of the test was to check for any hysteresis in the critical angles compared to the CW test you performed back in Jan (1/16).  You were able to complete all operations in great time and with good precision. Also, the excellent image quality was made possible by your choice of a longer working distance (we’re guessing 10ft?) with the ISS HD camcorder. This view should nearly eliminate the keystone effect and greatly increases the depth of field.  Thanks for picking up on our scientific terminology, reducing the need to report up specific vane angles, but rather specific fluid response effects, i.e. “search for the serrated gap de-wetting condition”. Your detailed description of the filled perforations after the vane de-wetted shows that wetting events leave perforations filled for VG2. This did NOT happen for VG1. Finally, when Mark says he is tracking a test point on those SLOW wetting events, we are literally sticking a Post-It note on the video monitor(s) down here on the ground, and marking with pen/pencil incremental points on the note to see if the fluid is still moving (pretty geeky, huh?).” CFS-A (Colored Fungi in Space-A, ESA):   No report.
