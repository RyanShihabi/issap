ISS On-Orbit Status 02/01/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  After wakeup this morning, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also during the morning inspection, Shkaplerov conducted the periodic checkup of the circuit breakers & fuses in the DC1 Pirs Docking Compartment.      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 & MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 & BPP-36.  MRM2 & MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.] CDR Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 25th for Dan, the 18th for André and Don.  The three crewmembers are performing their RST sleep shift session starting on 1/24 and every day through 2/2.        [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] For his on-going 2nd (FD30) Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Alternate experiment, Burbank reached midpoint at about 9:10m, after which Dan began the second 24h data collection period.      [For the second 24 hr period, the Cardiopres was temporarily doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery were changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).   Note: The crew experienced problems with the new Cardiopres unit launched on Soyuz 29S which was to be used to support blood pressure measurements for the ICV experiment.  After some real-time troubleshooting, crew was instructed to remove the hardware for the remainder of this experiment session.] FE-2 Anatoly Ivanishin performed his first session with the MBI-29 IMMUNO (Neuroendocrine & Immune Responses in Humans During & After Long Term Stay at ISS) equipment, using the SALIVA-I IMMUNO kit and the Plazma-03 Centrifuge to collect saliva and, with Shkaplerov’s help, blood samples which were then processed in the centrifuge by Anatoly and stored in MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) Dewar 2, Tray B, and Tray section 3-4 by Don Pettit. Afterwards, Ivanishin & Kononenko had ~3 hrs set aside for reviewing & studying the preliminary timeline and activities for the Russian EVA-30 (VKD-30) on 2/16.     [During the 6h 3m spacewalk (hatch open ~9:23am EST), Kononenko (EV1) & Shkaplerov (EV2) are scheduled to relocate the Strela-1 “crane” from DC1 to MRM2, install SMDPs (SM Debris Panels) on the SM (RO1 segment), and, if time permits, support the “Test” experiment on the SM RO1, install support struts on the DC1 EVA ladder, and install sample exposure panels of the space experiment “Vinoslivost” on MRM2.]  Both Burbank & Kuipers completed Day 4 of their (currently) daily electronic logging of diet for the High Salt Diet protocol of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment and taking BMMs (Body Mass Measurements) with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device).  Blood and urine samples will be collected tomorrow.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included), the crewmember is ingesting one of two special diets (low salt & high salt content).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.  SOLO was also part of the experiments done on the recent Russian Mars500 long-duration flight simulation.] FE-6 Pettit conducted Part 1 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the Soyuz 29S crew, i.e., Oleg, André & himself, for a 24-hr data take. FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anatoly also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). In the Lab, André Kuipers serviced the EarthKAM (EKAM/Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack, changing battery twice during the day and completing the scheduled lens change.     [EK uses a NIKON D2Xs electronic still camera with 50mm and 180mm lenses, powered by a battery, taking pictures by remote operation from the ground, without crew interaction.  It is available for students who submit image requests and conduct geographic research.  The requests are uplinked in a camera control file to the A31p SSC-20 (Station Support Computer) laptop which then activates the camera at specified times and receives the digital images from the camera’s storage card on its hard drive, for subsequent downlink via OpsLAN.  The camera battery is changed when no pictures are being taken.  EKAM uses new software on SSC-20 which replaces the version used for the DCS 760 camera. This is the 4th use of the D2Xs camera by EKAM.  Students around the world are anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images.] Ivanishin continued the current windows inspection in the RS started yesterday by Kononenko.         [Objective of the inspection, which uses a digital still camera (Nikon D2X w/SB-28DX flash) and voice recorder, is to assess the pane surfaces on RS for any changes (new cavities, scratches, new or expanded old stains or discolorations affecting transparency properties) since the last inspection.  The new assessment will be compared to the earlier observations.  Defects are measured with the parallax method which uses eyeball-sighting with a ruler and a right isosceles triangle to determine the defects' size and position with respect to the window's internal surface (parallax being the apparent change in an object's position resulting from changing the observer's position).] Afterwards, FE-2 conducted the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness). Anatoly also completed the periodic (~monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control & Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO2 filter assembly (BF) with a new spare, #127 (done last: 11/10).  The old unit was discarded as trash and the IMS updated.       [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO2, O2, and H2O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.] In preparation for the EVA-30, Dan Burbank took Anton & Oleg through a generic training session on the POC DOUG (Portable Onboard Computers/Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) software setup for tutoring Russian crewmembers. .    [DOUG is a special application running on the MSS (Mobile Service System) RWS (Robotics Workstation) laptops that provides a graphical birdseye-view image of the external station configuration and the SSRMS arm, showing its real-time location and configuration on a laptop during its operation.] In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Dan Burbank supported the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 1 once every two hours for seven days.  Burbank performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.] Later, the CDR had ~4 hrs set aside for installing & routing a video cable (W8996) for the HRCS (High Rate Communication System) from the nearby VSU (Video Switching Unit) in the Lab Aft Stbd Endcone (Video Switching Unit 3) to the Lab PD6 Standoff.  For assisting with the actual cable routing, André Kuipers lent a hand to assist with the actual cable routing and feed the cable through the endcone.       [In a future task the video cable W8996 will be connected between VSU #3 and video cable W9681 at the Lab PD6 Standoff.  HRCS will utilize the iAPS (improved Automated Payload Switch), iPEGH, and Ku-band Comm Unit to provide communications system improvements and increased Ku bandwidth.  When complete, HRCS will allow for two additional Space-to-Ground audio channels and two additional downlink video channels.] Don Pettit supported the ground in swapping the THC CCAA (Temperature & Humidity Control / Common Cabin Air Assembly) air conditioner in the U.S. Lab from starboard to port by closing off the S6 MFCV (Manual Flow Control Valve) and opening the P6 MFCV.  This allowed the swapover from the CCAA starboard channel (S6) to the alternate system on port (P6).  Later in the day, Pettit swapped the CCAA from P6 back to S6.     [The CCAA is a network of ducting that draws in the air through filters, delivers it for conditioning, and returns it to the modules.  The swap-over between the CCAA channels is generally done by the ground once a month, with crew support, to dry out the heat exchanger of the deactivated side.  MCC-H flight controllers command the required systems configurations for the dryout via S-band.] Later, with the G1 HD camcorder set up in the JAXA Kibo laboratory for downlinking his activity, FE-6 conducted another “LEGO Bricks” EPO (Education Payload Activity) session in the JPM MWA (Maintenance Work Area), building models of a Shuttle, Satellite and Rockets from Lego pieces from a guide book for ground audiences. André Kuipers started a sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.        [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] André also collected air samples with new GSCs (Grab Sample Containers) in the SM (#2091), Lab (#2080) and JPM (#2090), sequenced with the AQM sampling for postflight comparison. Anatoly Ivanishin started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, today working in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok) cleaning the TsV1 fan guard screen and replacing the PS1 & PS2 dust filter cartridges with new spares. Afterwards, Anatoly did the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways, of particular importance with a six-member crew on board.        [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] FE-1 & FE-4 again spent several hours unloading Progress 46P and transferring its cargo to the ISS while logging moves in the IMS. Shkaplerov concluded his 3rd session of the standard 24-hr. ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2-2 protocol, started yesterday.     [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, FE-1 doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] André completed the periodic manual filling of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) flush water tank from an EDV-SV condensate container.     [WHC was unavailable for use during the fill.] Burbank & Pettit had another time slot reserved for making entries in their electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Kuipers deployed newly arrived Emergency Procedures books, placing 6 EMER-1 books in SM, FGB, Lab, each Soyuz & Node-2, and 3 EMER-2 books in SM, FGB & Lab.      [After the deployment, MCC-Houston inhibited the MBSU-1 (Main Bus Switching Unit 1) Loss of Comm warning.  The new EMER books assume that MBSU 1 is loss of comm, and EMER procedures were the primary reason why the Warning was suppressed but not inhibited for all of this time. The state of the MBSU itself is unchanged, i.e., firmware-degraded.] At ~7:40am EST, all six crewmembers teamed up for the standard one-hour Crew Emergency Roles & Responsibilities Review (peredacha smeniy po bezopasnosti), to familiarize themselves with emergency roles & responsibilities as a 6-person crew, including escape routes.   Later, the crew had a ~20 min tagup with ground specialists to discuss particulars.        [Baseline emergency response actions are covered in the EMER-1 book.  Emergencies may arise due to ammonia (NH3) leak, non-ammonia toxic spills, fire or rapid depressurization.  In the event that a member of the 28S crew becomes incapacitated during such an emergency response, the whole crew will stop response procedures and return to their Soyuz spacecraft.  The 29S crew may, after conferring with the ISS CDR, egress their Soyuz and finish the response in this case.] CDR & FE-6 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Don at ~11:00am, Dan at ~12:45pm EST. At ~1:25pm, Burbank & Pettit conducted an IFM (Inflight Maintenance) Toolbox conference, intended to clarify the current configuration of the USOS IVA Tools, including crew intentions for the old Tool Drawers, and provide the ground with the “complete picture” of the onboard tool situation in the USOS.  Before sleeptime, Oleg will initiate battery charging for the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware.     [The FSS system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).. X2R11 Software Update:  The transitions to the new X2R11 software yesterday went very well, and the ground has completed all activities associated with the upgrade.     [Yesterday, loading the S3-2 & P3-1 MDMs (Multiplexer/Demultiplexers) with S3P3 R4 was finished. Also, PMCU-1 (Power Management Controller 1), already loaded with the new PMCU R4 software, was swapped into primary. Finally, PMCU R4 was loaded to the PMCU-2 MDM.]
