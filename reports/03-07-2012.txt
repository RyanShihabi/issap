ISS On-Orbit Status 03/07/12 Yesterday, on her 75th birthday, Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space, was honored in Moscow by Kirill, Orthodox Patriarch for Moscow and All Russia, with the second highest decoration of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Order for Glory and Honor which only very few persons have received before (like Pres. Putin or Fidel Castro).   Earth’s “spaceflight community” certainly embraces truly amazing people!Congratulations, Valentina Vladimirovna! All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-2 Ivanishin terminated his 5th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  Before sleeptime tonight, Anton Shkaplerov will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 6th Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth. In the SM, FE-4 Kononenko turned off the ASP Network Connection Adapter, as necessary when the GFI-17 Molniya-Gamma hardware is deactivated (by ground commanding).       [After each reboot of the RSS1 laptop, the ASP needs to be scanned, and the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) status log file dumped to RSS1 for downlink via OCA.  The GFI-17 Molniya-GAMMA (“Lightning-GAMMA”) experiment, mounted externally (since the Russian EVA-28), records atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.] Afterwards, Kononenko worked ~3 hrs in the MRM2 Poisk module, replacing its three IDZ-2 electro-inductive smoke detectors with the newer IDZ-3 models.     [Locations: behind panels 201, 301 at the В2 fan inlet behind the divider, on the frame near the ASP Passive Docking Assembly hatch next to Handrail 3126 closer to the hull, and on the ceiling, on the EVA equipment frame riser, closer to the starboard.] FE-5 Kuipers meanwhile performed the periodic inspection of the PEPs (Portable Emergency Provisions), checking PFEs (Portable Fire Extinguishers, PBAs (Portable Breathing Apparatus), and EHTKs (Extension Hose Tee Kits), a 3h 40min job.         [PFEs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in A/L (Airlock), 2 in Lab,1 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM.   PBA O2 Bottles: 5 in Node-1, 1 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 1 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM.  QDMAs or Prebreathe Masks: 6 in Node-1, 2 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM.   EHTKs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 1 in Node-3.] As part of the current crewtime-intensive activities resulting from the failure of the WPA (Water Processor Assembly, see 3/3 Status Report), FE-6 Pettit undertook the daily transfer of water from CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodinated) bags, degassed using MRFs (Microbial Removal Filters).  André Kuipers checked the transfer several hours later, then terminated the procedure and tore the equipment down for cleaning, using Povidone iodine wipes.      [Dan, Don & André are currently allowed use of the RS (Russian Segment) galley for drinking water instead of the PWD (Potable water Dispenser).  The decision has been made to replace the CR ORU (Catalytic Reactor Orbit Replaceable Unit) in WRS1 (Water Recovery System 1) in Node-3 with the onboard spare.  The removed catalytic reactor can possibly be fixed and remain on-orbit for use as a degraded spare.  Mitigation of microbial contamination needs to be considered.] Kuipers offloaded the Lab condensate tank to its neutral point to one of the CWCs, which amounted to about 30 min and about 6L condensate. After gathering tools & equipment required for the replacement of the WRS Multifiltration (MF) and Catalytic Reactor (CR) ORUs (On-orbit Replacement Units) of the WRS2 (Water Recovery System 2) in Node-3, CDR Burbank removed and replaced both MF ORUs from the WPA (Water Recovery Assembly).  This required temporary removal of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) Kabin.      [Rationale:  The onboard water system has been exhibiting a trend in rising TOCs (total organic compounds).  Since the crew will be installing a new and pristine CR, the amount of TOC that it experiences should preferably be minimized.  For this reason, Burbank also replaced the Multifiltration ORUs with new spares.]  After Dan’s IFM in Node-3, André restowed those items which Burbank used for the Multifiltration ORU and which are not required for the upcoming CR (Catalytic Reactor) ORU R&R. Don Pettit had time reserved for reviewing procedural material for the CR R&R.  Afterwards, at ~10:00am EST, Don conducted a teleconference with ground specialists to discuss details of the WRS CR maintenance work.  Also for the CR R&R, the CDR prepared the T2 treadmill and WRS1 racks in Node-3, removing T2 hardware and installing WRS1 pivot fittings to allow rack rotation.     [According to his recent assessment, the nearby T2 treadmill rack must be rotated out of the way to provide clearance for the WRS1 rack rotation, which would have required ~17 crew hours if done completely.  Dan found that a partial T2 rotation (to ~56 deg only) was enough to remove the rear panel access panel and disconnect the QDs on the catalytic reactor, saving considerable T2 work.] Kuipers also conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (29-0008M) lists 22 CWCs (308.3 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (3 CWCs with 87.7 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria, plus 1 empty bag;  2. Condensate water (2 CWCs with 9.8 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (6 CWCs with 79.9 L; also 6 expired bags with 104.3 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 6.4 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] In the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-6 Pettit configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware plus MBS (Mixing Bag System), including calibrating the PPFS software and checking instruments, and then conducted his 3rd session with the VO2max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake & Submaximal Estimates of VO2max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, integrated with Thermolab (head sensors).  After the session, Don powered down, cleaned up & partially stowed the equipment, and downloaded the data to a PCS laptop.       [The experiment VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.] Shkaplerov & Ivanishin spent several hours conducting an inventory/audit of RODF (Russian Operations Data File) cue cards, going by an uplinked listing of 50 entries and verifying their stowage location, number of copies, last revision data, revision number, overall physical condition, also condition of the cover, and tag, to facilitate the search. Kononenko had another 2 hrs allotted for loading excessed equipment & trash on Progress 46P (to be undocked on 4/19). Later, the three Russian crewmembers each had time set aside for another round of filming more “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY camcorder.  This is part of the ongoing effort to create a photo & video documentary database on the flight of ISS-30 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] Working in the Russian ASU toilet facility, FE-1 removed the SSD301 light fixture and replaced it with a newer SD1-5M unit. Later, Shkaplerov completed the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO2 (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit.     [The AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO2 during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP).] Anton also conducted the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)�CRO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)�CRO, PkhO�CDC1, PkhO�CFGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO�CFGB GA, and FGB GA�CNode-1.] FE-2 Ivanishin performed the periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), collecting eight Bubble dosimeters (A41, A42, A43, A44, A45, A46, A47, A48) to read their recorded radiation traces in a special Reader.  Afterwards the dosimeters were initialized for new measurements and redeployed.         [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.] Anatoly completed his 9th data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] FE-2 also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Oleg Kononenko took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-5 Kuipers supported Flight Controllers at Tanegashima by switching off the PROX/Proximity Communication System after the overnight checkout of the Cygnus PROX.  André then removed and disassembled the HCP (HTV Control Panel) and stowed it with its power & data cabling in the JPM.      [Cygnus is the name of the spacecraft being developed by Orbital to demonstrate cargo delivery services under the NASA COTS (Commercial Orbital Transportation Services) Space Act Agreement.  In addition to the COTS development and demo program, Orbital will utilize the Cygnus to perform ISS resupply flights under the CRS (Commercial Resupply Service) contract which authorizes eight missions between 2012 and 2015 carrying approximately 20,000 kg of cargo to the ISS as well as disposal of ISS waste.] Ivanishin conducted the regular transfer of US condensate water from CWC to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [Condensate was drawn from CWCs #1072 & #1039.  The 40-minute procedure is specially designed for gas/liquid separation, i.e., to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.] Before sleeptime, Anton will set up the battery of the GFI-8 Uragan payload for overnight recharging. Before Presleep, Pettit will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] CDR & FE-6 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Don at ~12:40pm, Dan at ~2:15pm EST. At ~3:30am, FE-1 Shkaplerov downlinked a special PAO TV message dedicated to the important Russian holiday tomorrow (3/8), the “International Women’s Day”, as per request from the Sevastopol regional state TV and Radio company (Sevastopol being Anton’s birthplace).        [“Our dear ladies, my best cordial wishes to you on this remarkable spring holiday of the best half of the humankind.  For us males, this is just another opportunity in a festive way tell you how much we love, thank, admire, and treasure you…..”] At ~1:20pm, Burbank & Pettit supported an Educational PAO TV event, responding to students’ questions from the “Destination Station” event at the Tech Museum in San Jose, CA. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+CEVIS (VO2max), with CEVIS following tomorrow.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C・        A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on Lipetsk, Allalin Glacier, the volcanoes Huascaran, San Cristobal, Stromboli, Mount Etna and Kilauea, and the Volga River Delta,・        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and・        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Paris, France (Capital Cities Collection: ISS had a late morning pass with a small possibility for clouds over this capital city.  Paris is situated on the Seine River and is the largest city in France with over 2 million people.  As ISS tracked ENE over the English Channel, looking right of track to acquire shots of the entire city), Brussels, Belgium (Capital Cities Collection: ISS had a late morning pass today with fair weather for this capital city target.  Brussels has a population of nearly 2 million is located in central Belgium about 70 miles inland from the North Sea.  As ISS tracked ENE and inland at this time, the crew was to look nadir for this major city), Plum Island Ecosystem, Massachusetts (Long Term Monitoring Site: Looking left of track over Cape Cod Bay, for an estuary on the bay north of Boston.  Changing nutrient flows in the estuary, where urban pressures have increased greatly, are the object of the research.  Data for many aspects of the research [water color, new housing, loss of natural landscapes, etc.] can be gleaned from ISS CEO imagery.  The crew’s visual cue is the Cape Ann peninsula north of Boston and Cape Cod), and West Hawk Impact Crater, Manitoba (Terrestrial Impact Crater: This 4.5 km-diameter crater was formed 350 million years ago, and despite several episodes of glacial erosion in the last 2 million years, is still evident in the landscape. Look to nadir for West Hawk Lake �C this now fills the impact structure.  Overlapping mapping frames of the impact structure were requested).
