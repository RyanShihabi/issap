New Status: 
ISS as Testbed for Analog Research (ISTAR) Treadmill 2 (T2) 6-Month Maintenance: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy successfully completed a regular maintenance on the T2. He cleaned closeout panels; inspected the treadmill motor carriage bolts, drive belt, treadmill mounting screws, tread belt slats and screws, damaged rack composite, and snubber cup liner; and vacuumed inside T2 rack space and filter screen.  The procedure was written as a one-time use procedure to be part of the ISTAR Exploration Detailed Test Objective (xDTO), and examines how mission operations can be optimized in the presence of speed-of-light communication delays of several minutes, similar to what would be experienced on exploration missions to Mars, near-Earth asteroids, or other targets in deep space.  The goal of the ISTAR T2 – 6-Month Maintenance procedure is to allow the crew to autonomously to execute the activity by giving them extra information needed to complete the procedure and solve any problems that may arise without having to call Mission Control Center-Houston (MCC-H).
Treadmill with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (TVIS) Disassembly: Following last week’s successful installation of the new Russian Treadmill (БД-2) the crew disassembled and stowed the removed TVIS for disposal in the Progress.
EXpedite PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack 1 Laptop Recovery and Software Load:Cassidy recovered the EXPRESS Rack 1 laptop by removing and reseating the hard drive.  He then attempted to reload the software to the hard drive, but was unsuccessful.  The crew replaced the hard drive with a spare and was able to successfully load the new software.  Following the reload the ground controllers were able to verify good communication with the payload Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) Interim Control Unit (ICU).
