ISS On-Orbit Status 02/19/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sleep shift in effect: The ISS crew’s workday began last evening at 3:44pm and ended this morning at 6:44 EST, i.e., 30 min earlier than yesterday (see time table at bottom).  At wake-up last night, FE-4 Kotov did the regular daily “early-morning” check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-4 again inspected the filters this morning before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Before breakfast & exercise, CDR Williams, FE-1 Suraev, FE-4 Kotov & FE-6 Creamer each completed a 10-min session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), which measures the red cell count of the blood, with one of them acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer, Russian: “Examiner”).  It was the first session for all three.     [The blood samples were drawn from a finger with a perforator lancet, then centrifuged in two microcapillary tubes in the M-1100 kit's minicentrifuge, and its hematocrit value was read off the tubes with a magnifying glass.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.  After the exam, the data were saved in the IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).]  For the biomed experiment INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function), Timothy Creamer performed his final Liquid Saliva collection, followed by the Blood Collection, assisted by Jeff Williams as operator for the blood draw.  The Saliva Return Pouches and Blood Sleeves were then stored at ambient temperature on the Soyuz for return to ground.     [IMMUNE protocol requires the collection to occur first thing post-sleep, before eating, drinking and brushing teeth, and all samples are stored at ambient temperature.  Along with NUTRITION (Nutritional Status Assessment),  INTEGRATED IMMUNE  samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects.]  Completing the relocation work on the OGS (Oxygen Generator System) in the Node-3, Jeff connected the H2 (hydrogen) sensor to the OGA (Oxygen Generator Assembly).  Later, the CDR verified that the OGS feed water jumper is properly mated to the OGS feedwater adapter hose.  Ground teams then began the process of the final activation steps for the OGS, to be activated in Standby mode to confirm its operability in Node-3.   Williams also installed the remaining rack UIP (Umbilical Interface Panel) closeouts in Node-3.  FE-1 Suraev again downloaded accumulated data of the running TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) equipment, which is taking structural dynamics measurements.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]  FE-4 Kotov prepared the new Russian Glavboks-S (Glovebox) for accepting samples, then collected first samples from the new bioscience experiment ASEPTIC (BTKh-39) in the MRM2 Poisk module, followed by sterilizing the equipment and again taking samples.  The FE-1 took documentary photographs and video of the activities.  Later, Oleg copied accumulated EXPOSE-R science data from the BSMM (Multiplex Bus Synchronization Unit) to a PCMCIA memory card in the RSS1 laptop.    [The European EXPOSE-R experiment contains plant seeds and spores of bacteria & fungi.  It was mounted outside the SM during the Russian EVA-21A on 3/11/09 after some earlier problems.]   Kotov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]  The FE-6 completed a periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]  FE-5 Noguchi configured the newly-transferred WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) in Node-3 for use by installing the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System 2) rack UIP closeout (with holes taped up) and the WHC UIP cover to protect from mold/bacteria growth.  The WHC is up and running for crew use.  Working with Terry Virts, Soichi Noguchi terminated the transfer of O2 with the ORCA from the Shuttle with the ORCA (Oxygen Recharge Compressor Assembly), then tore down and removed the transfer equipment.  The planned repressurization (and subsequent leak-checking) of PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3) was deferred due to troubleshooting on the UPA WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly), to find a suspected urine leak    [One liter of pre-treated urine is unaccounted for, and an internal leak is suspected.]  WPA (Water Processor Assembly) is currently in a “Shutdown” mode while teams assess an issue with MSL (Mostly Liquid Separator).  Later in the day, Jeff Williams & Soichi Noguchi packed the time-critical biomedical science payload samples along with two Ice Bricks from MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) in a DCB (Double Coldbag) for return on 20A.  Soichi & Terry reviewed briefing material on the upcoming major IFM of the Cupola cover panels.     [On 2/17, the crew could not install the Cupola corner panels due to surrounding structural interference.  The Necessary troubleshooting, originally scheduled for yesterday, was deferred until after Orbiter undocking to allow more time for rack relocations.  The relocation of the Cupola RWS (Robotics Workstation) to the Cupola was not performed yesterday (as reported here erroneously) but will wait until after the corner panels are installed.  At ~9:39pm EST last night, the Exp-22 & STS-130 crewmembers held the traditional Joint Crew News Conference with U.S. media at NASA centers and Japanese media in Tokyo.   At ~11:19pm, the 11 ISS/Shuttle occupants joined for the customary crew photo, followed by a brief Cupola Ceremony ribbon-cutting ceremony, officially inaugurating the new Italian-built 180-degree panorama window of the ISS.  The traditional Crew Farewell ceremony took place this morning at ~2:35am, followed by air duct removal and hatch closure at ~2:50am.    [Afterwards, with the Shuttle already controlling attitude of the mated stack with Orbiter ORB control, Terry & Steve initiated the standard one-hour leak check on the ODS (Orbiter Docking System).]  Undocking is scheduled tonight at 7:54pm EST.   STS-130/Endeavour is expected to return to Earth on 2/21 (Sunday) after its 14-day mission.  Landing opportunities at KSC are at 10:16pm & 11:51pm EST. There are additional opportunities at 1:20am & 2:55am Monday at EAFB (Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.), a backup landing site.   The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive device (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).   Sleep shifting started with the Progress docking on 2/4.
