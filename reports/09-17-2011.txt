ISS On-Orbit Status 09/17/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off duty.  Underway: Increment 29 (three-person crew). FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. Also at wake-up, CDR Mike Fossum & FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Afterwards, Fossum, Volkov & Furukawa joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Sergei completed regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of the TsV2 fan screen in the FGB and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. Afterwards, FE-4 inspected the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and verified proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.       [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] Volkov also took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.          [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~3:18am EDT, FE-4 used the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) to conduct a ham radio session with participants of the Domodedovo-2011 International Amateur Radio Operators of Russia Festival (close to 300 participants). At ~4:55am, Volkov conducted a second ham radio session with the Domodedovo-2011 festival. At ~5:25am, Sergei had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). At ~8:45am, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. Shortly before sleeptime, CDR Fossum will close the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5).

CFE-2 (Capillary Flow Experiment 2, NASA):      “Mike:  Excellent job yesterday on CFE-2 Vane Gap 1!  Your method to fill the vane perforations in preparation for testing was 100% successful.  We asked you to do it, but we didn’t really tell you how.  That was just great.  Every perforation was filled, every single one.  You found the critical wetting angles we were looking for, but you also identified something startling to us that we only wondered would happen.  With the perforations filled, we observed not just critical wetting of the gaps, but a bulk shift from one side of the container to the other.  Scott Kelly performed this same experiment previously with the perforations empty, and this did NOT occur.  The ONLY difference was the filled perforations.  This experiment has applications in developing screens and perforated plates to use in spacecraft tanks and other fluid systems to sort or separate bubbles from liquid, move liquid via capillary action, etc.  In micro-g the situations could lead to dramatically unexpected results depending on whether the materials have been wetted by the fluids or not.  Thanks for a fun run.  We'll process that data and compare with both our numerical and analytical predictions.  We put words on paper, and you do great stuff in space!” CFS-A (Colored Fungi in Space-A, ESA):   No report.

ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera, NASA):    Lighting conditions remain favorable over North America, allowing ISSAC to collect about 100 images during the past week.  Of these, about 20% were specifically for instrument characterization and calibration, about 20% were for agricultural investigations, and the remainder for various applications, from ecosystem assessment to hazard and disaster monitoring.  One such picture shows an image of the Bastrop Fire in central Texas.  Visible just east of the Lake Bastrop reservoir and the town of Bastrop, the burn scar as it existed on 9/7 can clearly be seen as a darker area contrasted against growing vegetation, shown in red.  In addition to vegetation, smoke is also visible in the near infrared, and thus wind blowing from the north leaves wispy trails of red smoke across the burned area.  ISSAC will attempt to get additional images of the Bastrop area to capture the full extent of the damage. IV Gen (Intravenous Fluids Generation):    No report.  KID/KUBIK6:    No report.

CEO (Crew Earth Observation):      Through 9/10, 28,466 CEO frames were received on the ground for review and cataloging.   “We are pleased to report your acquisition of imagery this week with times corresponding to those of our CEO Daily Target Lists for the following targets:  Astana, Kazakhstan; Bigach Impact Crater, Kazakhstan; Hurricane Katia, Atlantic Ocean; Tropical Storm Nate, Bay of Campeche; and Mississippi Delta Region, Gulf of Mexico.  Most of these sessions are still under evaluation and cataloging for content.  We do note that several of these sessions were acquired in an automated fashion with the camera mounted in the window and with a short lens setting and an automatic acquisition every few seconds. While these sessions with their panoramic views may yield useful context images of some of our targets and also may be suitable for producing videos, the individual photos are unable to meet our requirements for our targets due to their obliquity and lens settings.  Review of one of your not-automated sessions from last week  indicate that you nailed our capital city target of Baghdad, Iraq with several great views and we are able to remove it from our target requirements list. You also acquired fine imagery of Hurricane Katia using a variety of lens and look angles. Thanks for your efforts on these targets.  Your striking view of Owens Lake, California was published on the NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  Besides a good contextual view of the Owens River valley and the nearly dry lake your photo reveals the presence of a pair of intensely red halophilic bacteria blooms near the lake edges.  Kudos for this colorful view!” CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Kiev, Ukraine (ISS had a descending, near nadir pass over this capital city of Ukraine with a population of 2.6 million.  Fair weather was expected as ISS passed over this area, with a possibility of a few clouds.  The city is located on the Dnieper River, just south of the Kiev Reservoir.  Trying to capture the entire city in the CEO shots), Monaco, Monaco (as the crew tracked southeastward over Western Europe, they were to look right on the coastline for a nadir shot of Monaco.  Context views with the 180 mm lens were requested for the capital city image collection), Rome, Italy ("The Eternal City" and capital of Italy [population ~2.7 million] lies just inland from sea on the western coastline of the Italian peninsula.  As the crew tracked southeastward on this afternoon pass near the Italian peninsula, they were to look nadir for a context view of the Rome metropolitan), and Havana, Cuba (ISS had a nadir pass over Cuba’s capital city of Havana.  Looking right on the north coast of Cuba at a major estuary for context views of this city of 2.1 million).
