ISS On-Orbit Status 10/27/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew half-day duty. After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 & RSS2 laptops. Preparatory to tomorrow’s unberthing of the SpaceX-1 dragon capsule, CDR Williams & FE-6 Hoshide had ~2.5 hrs for packing return-to-Earth samples in DCBs (Double Cold Bags) which were then transferred to the Dragon vehicle in another 20 min. With Aki Hoshide taking documentary photo/video, Suni Williams powered down & removed the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezer, filled with samples, from its ER (EXPRESS Rack) location, transferred it to Dragon, installed it in the capsule and powered it up. With FE-4 Malenchenko providing handover guidance, FE-1 Novitskiy & FE-2 Tarelkin meanwhile performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home.      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Yuri, Oleg & Evgeny also completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the SKV air conditioner in the SM. FE-4 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] The CDR also closed down the Dragon-delivered experiment Micro-6 (Genotypic & Phenotypic Responses of Candida albicans to Spaceflight), removing & packing GAPs (Group Activation Packs) for return on Dragon.     [Steps included accessing CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) for removing & packing Micro-6 GAPs A-C,F-H,N,P, then accessing CGBA-1 for removing/packing GAPs D,E,I-M,O, plus YTSL (YouTube Spacelab) GAPs 1-6.   Background: Fundamental space biology experiments address basic questions of how life responds to gravity and space environments. The experiments probe the fundamental nature of life in order to enhance our understanding of how life responds to physical phenomena and physical forces on Earth and serve as the basic biological foundation in support of exploration. In particular, Micro-6 studies how microgravity affects the health risk posed by the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans. In our bodies, yeasts, especially the yeast Candida albicans help us maintain a healthy personal ecosystem. However, when our immune systems are stressed, Candida albicans can grow out of control. When that happens, yeast become so numerous that infections can result in the mouth, throat, intestines, and genitor-urinary tract. The equipment consists of GAPs stored in a flight-certified incubator at a temperature of 4 degrees centigrade. Each GAP contains eight FPAs (Fluid Processing Apparatuses) shaped like test tubes but designed to meet the unique requirement of mixing fluids in microgravity. Each FPA contains an isolated amount of the microbial culture of Candida, plus a growth medium and a termination reagent or fixative. During the three-week flight aboard the ISS, a crew member begins the experiment by increasing the incubator temperature to 30 degrees centigrade, and then activate the FPAs by pushing the plunger to mix the Candida with a growth medium. After 24 or 50 hours depending on the sample, the experiment will be terminated by pushing the plunger deeper into the FPA which combines a fixative agent to effectively stop the growth of the yeast cultures.] Afterwards, Sunita configured the Lab & Cupola RWSs (Robotics Workstations) to support MSS/SSRMS (Mobile Service System/Space Station Remote Manipulator System) operations during Dragon unberthing. Later, Suni also performed the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Williams conducted a final check of the GLACIER fridge in Dragon, while Hoshide powered up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) for downlinking video of their subsequent egress operations. At ~11:15am EDT, Suni & Aki egressed from Dragon, with MCC-Houston remote-commanding the Node-2 aft valve.  After hatch closure, CDR & FE-6 demated the ARS (Atmosphere Revitalization System) jumper and both 1553 data cables in the Dragon’s vestibule.  The remaining vestibule power jumpers will be removed tomorrow. Next, Ford & Hoshide installed the CBM CPA (Common Berthing Mechanism Controller Panel Assembly (CPA) at the Node-2 nadir port, as required for MCC-H to preparing the Node-2 nadir CBM for demating. Aki then turned off the MPC.  Kevin completed his (currently) daily task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch on a daily basis and continues on ISS on an SSC/Station Support Computer for every week after his first week in space. Ford also had a time/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC laptop.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] At ~6:15am, the three Russian crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~6:30am, Kevin Ford had his (currently) daily post-launch PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- & Ku-band audio/video. FE-1 & FE-4 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~8:40am, Yuri at ~11:00am EDT. Evgeny prepared for his & Oleg’s upcoming physical exercise sessions on the TVIS treadmill by formatting their PCMCIA memory cards for TVIS with their crew information. Ford, Tarelkin & Novitskiy took in the obligatory CMS (Countermeasures Systems) exercise overview which is required of each new crewmember prior to the first physical exercised session.      [The crewmembers familiarized themselves with location and usage of items such as the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) components (chest strap, transmitter, watch), TVIS & CEVIS PCMCIA memory cards, treadmill harness, ergometer & athletic shoes, and the SBS (Series Bungee System) assembly.] Oleg & Evgeny also brushed up on TVIS exercising by observing Yuri’s treadmill runs, and Kevin Ford familiarized himself with the ARED advanced resistive machine and the T2/COLBERT treadmill by watching it being used by Akihiko. The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-6) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6).      [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today shows ARED/T2 (continuous), with T2 (interval, 2 min.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), EVA, and T2 (int., 4 min.) for the next 6 days. Aki’s protocol for today shows ARED/T2 (cont.), with T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 4 min.), ARED/CEVIS, EVA and no exercise on the following 6 days.] Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andA ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) to record target sites on the Earth surface, andA 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of color bloom patterns in the waters of South-Eastern Pacific (SEPO) and Central-Eastern Atlantic (CEAO), then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (32-0005F) lists 20 CWCs (212.13 L total), including 6 empty bags, for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (3 CWCs with 113.1 L);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (5 CWCs with 54.55 L, plus 3 empty bags); 4. Waste water (1 CWC with 9.68 L bag EMU waste water), 5. Special Fluid (OGS) (1 CWC with 2.5 L), and Off-Nominal Water (1 CWC with 18.3 L, plus 1 empty bag).  One leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L, was trashed in ATV3.  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-Three – Week 5) 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ACE-1 (Advanced Colloids Experiment 1, NASA):  ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD Shielding (NASA/ASI):    To date, the session#2 has progressed nominally, with 75 cumulative days (of minimal 40 / preferred 60 days, no maximum acquisition duration) of science acquisition. The science team has formally confirmed the validity of the session#2 data. Though the preferred amount of data acquisition is reached, it is planned to continue measuring until the stowage of ALTEA SHIELD. Further data collection is expected to support statistical analyses later on.      [Background: Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):    No report.

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BCAT-C1 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test C1, CSA):    No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report. EPM (European Physiology Module):    No report.
