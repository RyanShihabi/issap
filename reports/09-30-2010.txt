ISS On-Orbit Status 09/30/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.        At wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]   CDR Wheelock & FE-6 Walker continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy & Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 5th for both of them, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]   Upon wake-up, Shannon Walker performed a new session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]   Shannon also began another 4-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 4th onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  Wheels’ new pro K session will start tomorrow.      [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]   Afterwards, FE-6 wrapped up the T-hose installation IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the WRS (Water Recovery System 1) rack.    [A delay of about half a workday was caused by the T-hose not fitting inside the volume of the WRS1 rack, requiring the crew to wire-tie the T-hose mounting plate and remove some foam to make the back panel fit back on.  The delay forced the major part of the T2 treadmill IFM to be deferred from yesterday to today, pushing out planned payload activities.]    CDR Wheelock & FE-6 Walker then continued their work on the T2/COLBERT treadmill, checking out the PAU (Power Avionics Unit), reassembling the VIS (Vibration Isolation System) and aligning & centering the rack in its location at Node-3 bay F5.    [Securing the Y-axis jam nuts is scheduled tomorrow, as is the deferred annual maintenance of the T2, and both manned and unmanned ACO (Activation & Checkout) runs are still on target for this weekend.  Plans are to have T2 operational by Saturday as originally planned.]   Also on Doug Wheelock’s timeline for today was another session with the HMS USND (Health Maintenance System / Ultrasound) system in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), with VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) adjusted to transmit views of the activities.     [After FE-6 Walker had cleared stowage to enable USND ops at loc. COL1F4, the CDR set up the USND system, checked it out and cleaned data off the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) USND hard drive.  Wheels then submitted himself for an eye examination scan executed by Shannon, serving as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Wheels later stowed the gear.]    FE-5 Yurchikhin took the periodic (generally monthly) health test with the cardiological experiment PZEh MO-1 (“Study of the Bioelectric Activity of the Heart at Rest”) on exercise equipment, his 2nd session.     [Equipment used was VPG/Temporal Pulsogram and 8-channel ECG/Electrocardiogram Data Output Devices (USI).  The test took place during an RGS (Russian Groundsite) overflight window (~4:44am EDT) via VHF for data downlink from the VPG and Gamma-1M ECG for about 5-6 minutes.]   On Progress M-05M/37P on the DC1 side (nadir port), Yurchikhin tightened the BZV quick release screw clamps of the SSVP docking mechanism, a periodic task.   After configuring the usual pumping equipment (Kompressor-M, hoses, adapters), Yurchikhin initiated urine transfer from 6 EDV-U containers in the DC1 to the empty BV1 Rodnik storage tank of Progress 37P, including 3 EDV-Us from the US Segment (#963, #874, #922) brought over yesterday by Wheels.  Two more containers (#913, #950) were to be disposed of in Progress without emptying their urine content.     [After the contents had been transferred, FE-5 was to flush the lines with 5 L of disinfectant solution from an EDV w/Disinfectant, running the compressor for 4 min.  Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]   Closing out the installation & configuration of the new PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) for the European ATV-2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) in the SM (Service Module), FE-5 performed a final checkout of the MBRL equipment which was successful.     [The test was “internal”, i.e., by Russia only.  A second test will be run which includes ESA ground teams.]   Later, FE-5 completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   Fyodor also had ~2.5 hrs for unloading cargo from Progress M-07M/39P, with IMS (Inventory Management System) updating.   The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (FE-5), and ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5, FE-6).  TVM Status:   RSC-Energia/Moscow reported that the three subsets of the TVM (Terminal Computer) systems in the SM were restarted successfully on 9/28.  All three TVM lanes are again fully functioning.   CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Tashkent, Uzbekistan (weather was predicted to be clear over this capital city.  ISS had a nadir-viewing opportunity to photograph the city.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural areas were requested), Falmouth, England (Beagle Site.  The crew had a near nadir-viewing overpass of the port city of Falmouth.  Charles Darwin's famous 1836 voyage on HMS Beagle ended when the ship dropped anchor here.  Overlapping mapping frames of the port were requested), Lusaka, Zambia (looking to the left of track for the capital city of Zambia.  The city is located on the southern part of the central plateau of Zambia.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural area were requested), Great Dike of Zimbabwe (ISS had a nadir-viewing overpass of this large geological feature.  A dike is a typically linear intrusion of igneous rock into preexisting older rock units, and this particular dike is unique in terms of its length [500 km] and width [several kilometers].  Of particular interest are faults that cut across the dike and offset it along its length.  Overlapping mapping frames tracing the dike were requested for comparison to older Shuttle imagery), West Hawk Impact Crater, Manitoba (weather was predicted to be clear over this 4.5 km diameter impact crater.  ISS had a near nadir-viewing overpass of West Hawk Lake [the surface expression of the impact structure].  Overlapping mapping frames of the impact structure were requested), and Georgetown, Guyana (ISS had a nadir-viewing overpass of this capital city.  The city is located at the mouth of the Demerara River on the Atlantic Ocean coastline.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and adjacent rural areas were requested).
