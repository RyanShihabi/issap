10-09-2011October 09, 2011ISS On-Orbit Status 10/09/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.       Sunday – Crew off duty.   Ahead:  Week 4 of Increment 29 (three-person crew). FE-4 Sergey Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. CDR Mike Fossum serviced the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) experiment, checking camera operations during the day and changing the camera battery in the morning and before sleeptime (change required after 8 hrs).       [The current experiment session is with a Harvard University mixed sample no. 5 which requires an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) timing software, power cables and camera USB cable.  Illumination is provided by Mini-MagLite and Flash, and the camera needs freshly charged battery every 8 hrs for its automated photography, triggered by the EarthKAM software.  This requires camera battery changes twice a day and image check with a battery change once per day.  In micro-G, the mixed (alloyed) colloid sample will develop over time an increasingly coarse structure of its colloid particles which are like tiny spheres evenly dispersed in a fluid, gas or solid to help stabilize the mixture.  Over time, these colloids can move around -- known as “coarsening” -- causing changes in the concentrations and properties of the substance.  On Earth, gravity complicates this research by causing heavy components to sink and lighter ones to float.  In space, however, these forces are minute, revealing the natural movement of the colloids. The on-orbit samples' aging process works more slowly and evenly, making it easier to study.  BCAT-5 was started by Mike on 9/21 with phase separation sample no. 4.] Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.  This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for calldown.       [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers]. Sergey also completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] Mike worked in the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment), integrating it with an EDV-U container instead of feeding the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) for processing.         [UPA urine in the WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly) was processed meanwhile by ground commanding to a quantity of ~2% in order to meet the constraint for tomorrow’s planned WSTA removal and ARFTA (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) installation.] Satoshi removed the 32GB Memory card from the JAXA SSHDTV (Super Sensitive High Definition TV) recorder, deactivated camera, and disconnected its cable from UOP (Utility Outlet Panel), after recording the overnight Giacobinid Meteor Shower.  SSHDTV was then relocated from the Node-3 Cupola back to Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and installed. Later today, Fossum turns on MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) routing and starts the playback to the ground of stored videos from the recent LEGO and EPO (Educational Payload Operation) demos, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about 4 hrs, Mike will turn MPC routing off again. All three crewmembers were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) on their schedule, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sergey at ~6:40am, Satoshi at ~1:10pm, Mike at ~3:35pm EDT. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR).. Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of bio-luminescent glow of high-production zones in the South-Eastern Pacific Ocean, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
