08-27-2012August 27, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 08/27/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway:  Week 9 of Increment 32 (six-person crew).  After wakeup and breakfast, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. The CDR also conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-Uurine collection system, looking for potential moisture. Upon wakeup, FE-3 Joe Acaba conducted his weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 34th time for Joe.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] FE-2 Sergei Revin serviced the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, extracting the top of the bioreactor (#6) from the TBU-Vincubator (+29 degC), shaking it with �moderately strong� movements for 2 minutes without taking it out of the case and inserting it again in TBU-V.      [Started on 8/23, this activity is being carried out for 21 days, once in the morning and once in the evening.] FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine daily & weekly servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.     [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings of SM & FGB for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM�s & FGB�s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & �On� durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers as required.] FE-2 took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance from the discretionary �time permitting� task list, updating/editing its standard �delta file� including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-6 Hoshide & FE-5 Williams jointly reviewed, set up and shot photo/video documentation of a JAXA Commercial Mission experiment for subsequent downlink via MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter). Afterwards, Sunita prepared the equipment for a NASA EPO (Education Program Operation) demo, scheduled tomorrow, which introduces the Exploration Design Challenge. Revin & Malenchenko had several hours set aside for unloading cargo from Progress M-16M/48P for stowage in ISS, going by an uplinked transfer/stowage list.      [Transfers of all cargo items have to be documented in the IMS database. KRP food ration containers were stored in MRM1 & FGB, Russian items in FGB in compliance with agreed-upon sharing of FGB stowage areas between Roskosmos and NASA.] Padalka & Revin conducted their 2nd onboard session each of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (�Study of the Veins in the Lower Extremities�), using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex with orthogonal leads, installed in the SM by Oleg Kotov in February 2010.       [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Gennady set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump & valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a �body box�) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).] Acaba supported POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center)/Huntsville on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab (loc. S3) by uninstalling & removing the three protective alignment guides from the rack.     [Also re-engaging the snubber pins and locking the safety pins to allow the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be active before begin of ground-commanded CIR operations requiring a microgravity environment.] Later, Joe supported today�s Robonaut activities with the first �human-like� robot in space, first setting up the Node-2 camcorder & MPC for Lab site coverage, then deploying and attaching the Robonaut Taskboard with Panels C & D for today, installing Robonaut at the P2 seat track location and cabling it in preparation for subsequent powered/ground-commanded operations.  Afterwards, Joe powered the robot down and left it assembled overnight in preparation for tomorrow�s activities.     [The ground executed scripts for Robonaut to grasp a handrail on Panel C, retrieve a wipe from the container on Panel D and then attempt to clean the handrail.] Williams & Hoshide performed checkouts on two SAFER (Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue) units to verify their functionality prior to Thursday�s EVA-18, Suni on SAFER #1003, Aki on #1005, and the latter also relocated the backup SAFER #1007 to the US A/L (Airlock). Performing troubleshooting work in the SM on the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system�s prime central processor subsystem (PTsB) behind panels 313 & 314, Padalka today replaced a component (BS1, TA415M) of the TA968MA box of itsPZUB data storage unit with a new BS1 spare from spares in a 5-hr operation. Later, the CDR supported the ground-commanded activation of the Elektron oxygen generator by pressurizing the assembly�sBZh Liquid Unit with nitrogen to ensure safe operation, i.e. prevent hydrogen (H2) presence in the O2 line.      [The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.  Note: With BITS2-12 & VD-SU control mode turned off for the TA415M BS1R&R, the following equipment had to be deactivated to avoid operation in the absence of real-time telemetry:  1. Elektron(shutdown by crew or ground).  2. SKV air conditioning system (shutdown by crew or ground).  3. Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal unit (no telemetry if in automatic mode, no impact if in manual mode).  4. BMP micropurification unit (automatic shutdown).  5. SRV-K condensate water processor (can be shut down by crew or ground, usually not required).  6. BRI data conversion unit (smart router) is power cycled when VD-SU mode is cycled.   7. Due to the lack of telemetry, there is no dP/dt (pressure drop) detection in the RS (Russian Segment).  8. Fire & smoke alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the PSS (Caution & Warning) panel speaker.  9. Total pressure alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the PSS speaker.] Sergei completed the periodic (every Monday) verification of the automatic IUS AntiVirus definition update on the Russian VKSauxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2, as well as the manual update on the non-network laptops RSE-Med& RSE1.     [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the SSCV4 software update.  Before the installation (on 8/8/11) of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday], Aki & Joe had another 1h 15m reserved for packing & stowing excessed cargo & trash on the HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3) for disposal, followed by a debrief tagup by FE-6 to report on progress.      [Kounotori-3 (Stork 3) will undock on 9/6.] Working in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Joe powered up the PC2 (Portable Computer 2) laptop at loc. A14 for troubleshooting it.     [If it did not boot into Windows, he was to take a photo of the screen and power off the machine using the power button, and report the outcome.] Using an animation video and RODF (Russian Onboard data File) material, Malenchenko reviewed procedures for tomorrow�s scheduled R&R (removal & replacement) of a part (23A288, A5) of the SUBK Onboard Complex Control System in the FGB.       [SUBK uses 7 relay switches (UKP) to control onboard systems and components in the FGB, in one of three modes: (a) automatic (using ground commands via the Komparus system, commands from the Russian and U.S. segments, and commands generated by the SM computer), (b) program relay (backup, using Komparus and SUBK relay components), and (c) command relay (commands from the ground via the Komparus comm portal or transmitted from the SM.)] Afterwards, Yuri dumped brine from the Node-3 WRS ARFTA (Water Recovery System Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) into the WDS (Water Distribution System) tank of the ATV3 cargo vehicle for disposal, using the Russian pumping equipment with electric-powered compressor.      [The Russian and US compressors are identical but the former was used after some discussion of allowable pressure settings (0.8 atm vs. 0.5 atm) to drain the ARFTA with the ATV tank empty.] Sergei Revin configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h 15m session, his 4th, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember�s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] Sunita Williams serviced the VIABLE experiment (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS), touching and blowing the top of each of 4 VIABLE bags in the FGB (loc. 409) where they are stowed to collect environment samples.  She also took documentary photography of the VIABLE setup.       [This investigation evaluates microbial biofilm development on space materials.  Objectives are to determine the microbial strain producing the anti-biofilm product, evaluate the chemical nature of the anti-biofilm product, study the innovative materials which are chemo-physically treated, and address the biological safety issues associated with microbial biofilms.  Background: Most surfaces are covered with microorganisms under natural conditions.  The process by which a complex community of microorganisms is established on a surface is known as biofilm formation.  Microbial biofilms can exist in many different forms by a wide range of microorganisms.  The process of biofilm formation is a prerequisite for substantial corrosion and/or deterioration of the underlying materials to take place.  VIABLE samples are composed by both metallic and textile space materials either conventional or innovative (Aluminum, Armaflex and Betacloth).  They are placed inside four foam lined Nomex bags, specifically:  Pouch 1 - untreated space materials; Pouch 2 - space materials pre-treated with biosurfactants; Pouch 3 - space materials pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide; Pouch 4 - space materials chemo-physically pre-treated with silica and silver coating.] Joe completed the standard 30-day inspection of the AED (Automated External Defibrillator) in the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) rack.       [AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient.  It then can treat them through defibrillation, i.e., the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.] Williams set up the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) equipment in COL in front of the HRF-1 rack with Calibration Arm and Calibration Mass, to perform a control run for calibration.  Afterwards, Joe Acaba used SLAMMD to measure his body mass, followed in suit later by Sunita and Akihiko.  As last user, Aki then powered off, disassembled and stowed SLAMMD hardware including the SLAMMD Accessories Kit.        [SLAMMD, performed first on Expedition 12 in December 2005, provides an accurate means of determining the on-orbit mass of humans spanning the range from the 5thpercentile Japanese female to the 95th percentile American male.  The procedure, in accordance with Newton�s 2nd Law of Motion, finds the mass by dividing force, generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer, by acceleration measured with a precise optical instrument that detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing.  The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.  To calculate their mass, crewmembers wrap their legs around a leg support assembly, align the stomach against a belly pad and either rest the head or chin on a head rest.  For calibration, an 18-lbs. mass is used at different lengths from the pivot point, to simulate different mass values.  Crew mass range is from 90 to 240 lbs.] In preparation for Thursday�s spacewalk by Suni Williams & Aki Hoshide, Suni terminated EVA battery maintenance in the A/L BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly), and then she and Aki installed REBAs (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assemblies) #1008 in the backpacks of EMU (EVA Mobility Unit) 3011 and #1012 in suit 3015. Using the REBAs, Suni & Aki then checked out powered suit hardware, verifying that the EMU glove heaters are working, EMU TV cameras (#1006 on 3011, #1007 on 3015) are receiving power, and the EHIP (Extravehicular Mobility Helmet Interchangeable Portable) light (ELLs/EHIP Light Locks) are properly installed. On the running BCAT (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test)-C1 experiment setup, Joe changed the settings of the photo intervalometer from 10 min. & 48 intervals to 2h & 60 intervals.       [The Canadian BCAT-C1 studies nano-scale particles dispersed in liquid, known as a colloidal suspension, commonly found in such commercial commodities as paint, electronic polishing compounds and food products. These suspensions have the unique property that the particles separate -- like oil and water -- and the particles then self-assemble into crystals that interact strongly with light, like opal. Photographing these samples in micro-G allows the measurement of these processes while avoiding the effects of particle sinking due to gravity. This study enables the development of new insights into this important materials process. Major differences of C1 to other BCATs are specific flash angle, increased lens-to-SGM distance, and the freedom to use the focus adjustment ring.] Yuri Malenchenko worked on the Russian VB-3M cycle ergometer (VELO) which has become noisy during operation.  Yuri�s task consisted of repairing a link rod by renewing a washer and reconfiguring it, and replacing two rubber/metal sleeve inserts (�silent blocks�) on the VELO�s generator unit.  Ground specialist tagup was available if required. FE-3 had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Before Presleep, Acaba turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~10:05 am, the three USOS crewmembers, Acaba, Hoshide & Williams, joined up for another 45-min EVA-18 procedures review & discussion with MCC-H spacewalk specialists. At ~11:55am EDT, Suni Williams & Joe Acaba supported a PAO TV event, downlinking their responses to questions from library visitors at �Destination Station� at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, Boston, MA. The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [FE-6 & FE-5 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Suni�s protocol for today had ARED/CEVIS (aerobic, continuous), with T2 (30sec, int.), ARED (video)/CEVIS, EVA-18, and T2 (4 min, int.) for the next 4 days.  Aki�s protocol showed T2 (30sec/int) for today, and ARED/CEVIS, T2 (4 min, int.), and EVA-18 on the following 3 days.] After his workout on the T2 machine, Aki closed down the treadmill software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display.     [After the display shutdown, the T2 rack is power cycled (turned off/on) from the ground, and T2 is then ready for use.  These power cycles allow for the T2 data to be transferred to the Server for downlink.]  Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary �time permitting� job for today were �More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia�s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andA detailed & general view photo session of the flooding which occurred overnight on 8/21-22 at the Black Sea;   [the disaster zone includes the towns Novomikhalovsky, Lermontovo and Tenginka, the Shapsukho & Nechepsukho river valleys and the adjacent mountain region.  Novomikhalovsky is located on the Tuapse-Novorossiisk Highway, 33 km from Tuapse and 14 km from Dzubgi. The town is situated in the Nechepsukho river valley and its tributary Psebe, where Nechepsukho is falling into Mikhalovsky Bay in the Black Sea. As a result of torrential rain the Nechepsukho River flooded.  600 houses, a hospital and a school were in the disaster zone. Four people died, 1500 were affected, including 275 children.  Municipal infrastructures need to be restored. Lermontovo is located on the shores of Tenginsky Bay of the Black Sea, at the inflow of Shapsukho River. The valley of that river is approx. 40 km in length, 5 km to the east of Dzubgi on the Tuapse-Novorosskiisk highway and 55 km from Tuapse. The Tenginka village is located 4 km upriver].
