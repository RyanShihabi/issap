Direct Current Switching Unit (DCSU) 4A Power On Reset (POR): Tuesday evening at 6:10 pm CDT DCSU-4A experienced a POR.  Power was lost to 3 downstream Direct Current-to-Direct Current Converter Units (DDCUs) plus the DDCU on the P4 Integrated Equipment Assembly (IEA). Service Module voltage and current stabilizers [CHT]s 23 and 24 also lost power but [CHT]s 21 and 22 were still available resulting in only a small power deficit to the Russian segment.  Of the 3 DDCUs, all were in paralleled pairs, but Parallel Input Undervoltage Protection (PIUV) was enabled for the Node 3 pair, meaning the 1B4A bus lost all power.  The loads that lost power included: 4A Pump Flow and Control Subsystem (PFCS), Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM), Treadmill 2, Hub Control Zone 1 Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (HCZ-1 MDM), Node3-1 MDM, Oxygen Generator System (OGS), Node3 Common Cabin Air Assembly (CCAA), Node3 Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL), Node3 Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA), and [CHT]s 23 and 24.  The crew was woken up and, with the loss of the CCAA, were prime for smoke detection in Node 3 and the PMM. Ground teams review the DCSU 4A data and found no indications of hardware problems. Ground teams are still in the process of recovering and reconfiguring Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Teams have had some issues recovering the Node 3 CDRA. Lab CDRA has been activated in the interim while teams continue troubleshooting.
 
HRP Operations: Kelly and Kornienko performed a Reaction Self-Test upon wake-up and prior to sleep.  Kelly completed Observation #10 of the Habitability study and his FD 135 Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study (Sprint) Volume of Oxygen Utilized (VO2) Max session.

Reaction Self-Test aids crewmembers to objectively identify when their performance capability is degraded by various fatigue-related conditions that can occur as a result of ISS operations and time in space (e.g., acute and chronic sleep restriction, slam shifts, extravehicular activity (EVA), and residual sedation from sleep medications).
Habitability assesses the relationship between crew members and their environment in order to better prepare for future long-duration spaceflights to destinations, such as Near Earth Asteroids (NEA) and Mars. The ultimate goal is to understand how much habitable volume is required for vehicle internal design and layout, and if mission duration impacts the volume needed.
Kelly performed his Sprint exercise session on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS). The Sprint investigation evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise training to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in ISS crewmembers during long-duration missions. Upon completion of this study, investigators expect to provide an integrated resistance and aerobic exercise training protocol capable of maintaining muscle, bone and cardiovascular health while reducing total exercise time over the course of a long-duration space flight.

 
Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Zero Robotics Preparations: Kononenko completed an On-Board Training (OBT) and procedure review in advance of the Zero Robotics Dry-Run scheduled for tomorrow. The SPHERES Zero Robotics investigation establishes an opportunity for high school students to design research for the ISS. As part of a competition, students write algorithms for the SPHERES satellites to accomplish tasks relevant to future space missions. The algorithms are tested by the SPHERES team and the best designs are selected for the competition to operate the SPHERES satellites on board the ISS.
 
Radi-N Neutron Field Study (Radi-N): Kononenko handed over the eight Radi-N detectors to Lindgren who deployed them around the ISS. The objective of this investigation is to better characterize the ISS neutron environment and define the risk posed to crewmembers’ health and provide the data necessary to develop advanced protective measures for future space flight.
 
On-board Training (OBT) H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) Robotics Onboard Trainer (ROBoT) Session 1: In preparation for HTV5 arrival scheduled on August 20, Lindgren, Yui and Kelly participated in this training session. The crew practiced a 30 meter approach and two Capture Point hold runs.
 
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Pressurized Module (JPM)1F2 Activities: In preparation for the Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR) arriving on HTV5 and subsequent installation, Lindgren relocated items stowed in the JPM1F2. Then Yui removed the hard dummy panel and JEM blue stowage rack, replaced the Active Rack Isolation System (ARIS) pivot fitting bottom and installed a soft dummy panel.
 
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Today, the Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the Mobile Serving System (MSS) and translated the Mobile Transporter (MT) from Worksite 4 (WS4) to WS5.  Prior to the translation they continued the MSS Checkouts in preparation for HTV5 capture on GMT 232 (20 Aug 15).  MSS performance today was nominal.
