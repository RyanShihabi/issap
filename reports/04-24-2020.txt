CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack): The crew prepared the CIR to allow ground commanding of the FOMA (Fuel Oxidizer Management Assembly) Calibration. The CIR includes an optics bench, combustion chamber, fuel and oxidizer control, and five different cameras for performing combustion experiments in microgravity.
GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation): The crew performed still photography of the GEDI external hardware from the aft JEM window. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provides high-quality laser ranging observations of the Earth’s forests and topography required to advance the understanding of important carbon and water cycling processes, biodiversity, and habitat.
Systems
Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) Brine Filter:  As part of regular maintenance, the ISS crew opened the UPA Fill Drain Valve Enclosure, removed the installed/old brine filter and replaced it with a new one. UPA brine filters are replaced every 60 days.
Max Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS): The crew completed Max CEVIS today which is used by the medical community to evaluate astronauts’ aerobic fitness. The test is performed every 90 days and upon the crew’s arrival and departure from the ISS.
Portable Pulmonary Function System (PPFS) Troubleshooting: The crew performed a leak detection assessment on the Human Research Facility (HRF) gas cylinder and Portable PFS today. The test used high O2 concentration from the gas canister to enable the crew to use the Portable Oxygen Monitor (POM) to test for O2 leakage from the PPFS. The purpose of the troubleshooting was to identify possible sources of a leak within the Portable PFS or associated hardware accessories.
