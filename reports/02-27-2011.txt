ISS On-Orbit Status 02/27/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     .   Sunday – FD4 (Flight Day 4) of STS-133/ULF-5. Crew sleep cycle shifting (see below).    Ahead:  Week 15 of Increment 26.    .   Sleep cycle shifting:  Crew wake/sleep cycle will be shifted starting this morning. Current schedule for ISS crew (EST): DateWAKESLEEP2/277:23am9:53pm2/286:23am9:23pm3/15:53am8:53pm3/25:23am8:23pm3/34:53am7:53pm3/44:23am7:23pm3/53:53am4:33pm3/61:00am4:30pm  Early this morning, FE-2 Skripochka undertook the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] Also at wake-up, CDR Kelly, FE-5 Nespoli & FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 11th for Scott, the 12th for Cady & Paolo.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), CDR Kelly disconnected cabling & umbilicals between EMCS (European Modular Cultivation System) and the ER3 (EXPRESS Rack 3, loc. A0) and rotated the rack down for access for the subsequent WOOV8 (Water On/Off Valve #8) activities. After adjusting VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) toward ER3 in COL to cover his activities, FE-5 Nespoli went to work on the major IFM (In-flight Maintenance) of removing the failed WOOV8 with its insulation covers and installing instead a WOOV Manifold in its place on the COL PAM (Photoacoustic Analyzer Module) panel.       [WOOV Expander OSE (Orbital Support Equipment) and the WOOV Manifold were delivered on ULF-5.  The WOOV8 valve will be returned on Discovery.  The IFM included cleaning the worksite with vacuum cleaner and wet wipes, collecting samples of a gel-like deposit from the WOOV8 valve, taking pictures of the rotated-down ER3, repairing TCS (Thermal Control System) pipe thermal insulation shells as required.  Afterwards, ER3 was tilted up to its nominal position and umbilicals and cabling were re-connected.]  Nespoli also assisted in the preparations for tomorrow’s EVA-1 spacewalk by Drew & Bowen by recharging three NIKON D2X camera batteries.     [Batteries must be charged for at least three hours.] Later, Paolo checked on the proper installation of the VDS (Video Distribution System) video cap in Node-2 which enables pass-through reception of video from the Discovery with the Orbiter docked in support of SSRMS ops. FE-1 Kaleri cleaned up in the SM (Service Module) after yesterday’s removal of ATV PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) hardware from behind Panels 225 & 226, restoring initial conditions. Kaleri also took 4-5 photos of the docking cone of the passive docking assembly (ASP-B) of the SM aft port occupied by ATV2 “Johannes Kepler”, a standard practice after Russian dockings.  These images are used to refine current understanding of docking conditions.  Sasha subsequently downlinked the pictures via OCA assets.     [The objective is to take photo imagery of the scratch or scuff marks left by the head of the docking probe on the internal surface of the drogue (docking cone, ASP) ring, now rotated out of the passageway.  Before shooting the picture, the cosmonaut highlights the scuffmark with a marker and writes the date next to it.  As other crewmembers before him, Alex used the Nikon D2X digital still camera to take the pictures with the hatch partially closed.] In preparation for their return to gravity on 3/16 with CDR Kelly, Alex Kaleri & Oleg Skripochka undertook the first (of five) training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the Russian VELO ergometer, assisting each other in turn as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).     [The 50-min assessment, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground sites (DO3, 10:59am-11:18am; DO4, 12:33pm-12:49pm), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of Sasha’s & Oleg’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, today set at -20, -25, -30 and -35mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] Alex completed the periodic (currently daily) checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1. This checkup is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently twelve persons.] MS-4 Nicole Stott, CDR Steve Lindsey & MS-3 Mike Barratt spent several hours on transferring cargo from the Shuttle middeck to the ISS.     [Total middeck transfers were expected to require ~31 hrs.] Cady Coleman serviced the CSA-CPs (Compound Specific Analyzer- Combustion Products), changing out the batteries in both CSA-CP sampling pumps and in the newly resupplied CSA-CP units, verifying the sensors are not contaminated and then zero-calibrating the new units for use on ISS.  Other activities on Cady’s work list for today included –Completing servicing the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) galley fridge, today installing 2 fresh desiccant packs after letting the cooler dry out for 24 hrs,  [MERLIN is used for cold storage of crew food and drink],Using the CDM (Carbon Dioxide Monitor) to take the daily CO2 readings,Setting up the equipment & tools required for configuring the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) vestibule prior to PMM ingress on FD7,Packing 2 DCBs (Double Coldbags) with 18 ice bricks at +4 degC and 2 NLP (National Lab Pathfinder) Vaccine-11 experiment packs for return on ULF5,Performing periodic maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) by evacuated its cylinder flywheels to re-establish proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration, andRetrieving 17 Area Dosimeters for return on ULF5 and installing 17 new ones on the walls of the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment), plus taking a photo of each installed unit. Cady Coleman also worked with Nicole Stott on the controls of the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System), walking it off to PDGF-1 (Power & Data Grapple Fixture 1) on the MBS (Mobile Base System) and maneuvering it to the translate configuration.      [MT (Mobile Transporter) will translate to WS3 (Worksite 3) tomorrow.] FE-4 Kondratyev had ~15 min to transfer his latest video recording to SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for downlinking to TsUP-Moscow.      [Dmitri Kondratyev’s Videoblog project, recorded by Dima at his convenience, began on 1/8, with frequent downlinks via OCA (not to exceed 300 Mb),]  Later, FE-4 spent another ~2 hrs on unloading Progress M-09M/41P, docked at DC1 nadir, and transferring cargo to ISS.  In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) Scott Kelly continued the surface sampling using MDS (Microbial Detection Sheets) and wet wipes started yesterday by Cady for the JAXA Microbe-2 experiment, plus taking documentary photography of the sampling locations.       [The sampling used MDS spread out at specific sampling locations (Saibo Rack wall, Node-2/JEM hatch handrail, JPM OA1 diffuser) with moistened cover film open.  After taking documentary photography, the sampling sheets were transferred to MELFI-3, the white packing tubes were trashed and the sampling locations cleaned up.] Working with Steve Lindsey, CDR Kelly terminated the transfer of O2 (oxygen) from the Shuttle with the ORCA (Oxygen Recharge Compressor Assembly), then reported the ORCA cycle counter to the ground. Later, Kelly & Lindsey will set up the jumper equipment for transferring O2 from the Discovery to ISS PBA (Prebreathe Assembly) ports in support of EVA mask-prebreathing (denitrogenation) by the spacewalkers Drew & Bowen for tomorrow’s EVA-1. Scott also turns around (readies) the NIKON D2Xs EVA cameras for the spacewalk. Oleg Skripochka had ~2 hrs to conduct OTKLIK (Tekh-19, “Response”) photography of areas behind SM panels to facilitate later payload installation.      [This was a repeat of a photo session performed on 1/26/11.  Additional imagery is required to re-evaluate access to mounting seats for sensor installation and cable hookups.] The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).        [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is done regularly after the last T2 session of the day.] At ~9:48am EST, Dmitri Kondratyev had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). At ~2:43pm, Scott Kelly & Cady Coleman joined with Shuttle crewmembers Steve Lindsey, Eric Boe, Al Drew, Steve Bowen, Mike Barratt and Nicole Stott in a PAO TV downlink, engaging in interviews from four clients.     [The Weather Channel (Ioanna Dafermou), WBZ Radio, Boston, MA (Mary Blake), WSB-TV, Atlanta, GA (John Bachman), and WTVT-TV, Tampa FL (Lloyd Sowers).] After Scott Kelly has prepared the A/L EL (Airlock Equipment Lock) for tonight’s Campout, he and Paolo Nespoli will join the Shuttle crew at ~6:13pm for an in-depth one-hour review of procedures for the EVA-1 spacewalk, with egress scheduled tomorrow morning at ~11:18am.     [During this spacewalk, Drew & Bowen will install a power extension cable, move the failed ammonia PM (Pump Module) to an external stowage platform, move a portable foot restraint and install a camera wedge.  The failed ammonia PM was temporarily stowed on the POA (Payload ORU Accommodation) during the last mission.] Tonight at ~8:48pm, Al Drew (EV1) & Steve Bowen (EV2) will begin their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) in the A/L with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe (~8:48pm-9:54pm) and sleep from 10:23pm-6:23am.  A hygiene break, with temporary repress to 14.7psi and depress back to 10.2psi, is scheduled for 7:13am-8:13am.  This will be followed by EMU Preps (8:13am-9:43am), EMU Purge (9:43am-9:58am), EMU Prebreathe (9:58am-10:48am) and Crewlock Depress (10:48am-11:18am).      [Sleep for the ISS crew begins half an hour earlier, at 9:53pm.] Mission Timeline Look-Ahead (all times EST):Feb 28 (FD 05):  EVA #1 (power cable install, PM (Pump Module) stow, camera wedge, other tasks) •        Wake-Up (STS & ISS)     06:23 am•        EVA Prep                                    08:13 am•        EVA1 Egress                               11:18 am       •        612 Cable Install                          11:48 am       •        Failed Pump Module Retrieval  12:48 pm•        Failed PM Stow                01:13 pm•        CP3 Camera Wedge Install       03:18 pm•        JAXA’s “Message in Bottle”          05:03 pm•        EVA1 Ingress                              06:43 pm•        Sleep (ISS)                                  09:23 pm•        MT Translation to WS3    09:23 pm•        Sleep (STS)                                 09:53 pm Mar 1 (FD 06) PMM install, transfers, EVA #2 prep and campoutMar 2 (FD 07) EVA #2 (PM vent, LWAPA retrieval, SPDM, other tasks), PMM activate & ingress Mar 3 (FD 08) ISS reboost, transfers, crew off duty time  Mar 4 (FD 09) Final transfers, crew off duty time, hatch closureMar 5 (FD 10) Undock, Flyaround, late inspection Mar 6 (FD 11) Orbiter FCS checkout, RCS hot fire, cabin stowageMar 7 (FD 12) Deorbit and Landing (nominal landing) No CEO targets uplinked for today.
