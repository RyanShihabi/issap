ISS On-Orbit Status 08/01/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. For supporting the Progress M-16M/48P docking tonight (~9:24pm EDT), the crew was split in two shifts, with USOS crew remaining on nominal time :   Crew 1 (Padalka, Revin, Malenchenko):Wake1 – 2:00am (today)Sleep1 – 10:00am (today)Wake2 – 2:00pm (today)Sleep2 – 12:00am (tomorrow)Wake3 – 9:00am (tomorrow)Sleep3 – 5:30pm (tomorrow)Wake4 – 2:00am (Thursday, return to nominal) Crew 2 (Acaba, Williams, Hoshide):Wake1 – 2:00am (today)Sleep1 – 5:30pm (today)Observe 48P docking: 8:45pm-10:15amWake2 – 2:00am (tomorrow, nominal) At wakeup, Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. The CDR also conducted the periodic checkup of the circuit breakers & fuses in the DC1 Pirs Docking Compartment.      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 & MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 & BPP-36.  MRM2 & MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.] FE-5 Sunita Williams had Day 3 of the pH test and diet log entry for the Pro K pH plus controlled diet menu protocol of her first (FD15) Pro K Controlled Diet activity.  After recording her diet input today, Suni broke out and set up the equipment for the associated urine collections tomorrow (8/2).  Blood sampling will follow on Thursday (8/3).    [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] FE-6 Hoshide terminated his first session of the ESA/German experiment CRHYT (Circadian Rhythms), removing the double sensors and Thermolab unit, then cleaning the sensors and stowing the equipment.       [The main objective of the experiment is to get a better basic understanding of any alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights.  Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest- and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions.  The Circadian Rhythms experiment is performed over 3 days (from Day 1 to Day 3) and involves:  Instrumentation (Day 1); 36-hrs continuous measurement (Day 1 + 2 + 3), and De-instrumentation (Day 3).  On-orbit measurements are planned for FD 15, FD30 and then at 30 day intervals until return.  During Day 1, the instrumentation is performed late in the afternoon. This consists of donning the Thermolab Double Sensors at the forehead and sternum positions. By powering on the Thermolab Control Unit the 36 hours measurement is started.  During Day 2, the Thermolab Control Unit will measure throughout the day. No interaction is required other than confirming the Thermolab Control Unit is measuring by checking the display from time to time. Akihiko Hoshide performed his first (FD15) ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Resting Echo Scan in the US Lab, assisted by Joe Acaba who served as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) to operate the USND (Ultrasound) scans.       [Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable & VOX, Aki underwent the USND scan for ICV assessment, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera.  Heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor).  There are dietary constraints, and no exercise is allowed 4 hrs prior to scan.  After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed.  Later, the data from the two HM-2 (Holter Monitor 2) HiFi Cards and two Actiwatch Spectrums were transferred from the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) hard drive to the USND-2 USB drive.  Voice required last 5 minutes for crew to inform ground copy process is complete.  The USND echo experiment uses the Image Collector software on the laptop and requires VOX/Voice plus RT Video downlink during the activity.  Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).] Afterwards, Hoshide also conducted his first in-flight ESA Vessel Imaging (Echography) ultrasound scans in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), assisted by Joe as Operator, using the Image Collector software on the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop, with VOX/Voice plus real-time video downlink during the activity.    [Vascular Echography (Vessel Imaging) evaluates the changes in central and peripheral blood vessel wall properties (thickness and compliance) and cross sectional areas of long-duration ISS crewmembers during and after long-term exposure to microgravity.  An LBNP (Lower Body Negative Pressure) program will be run in parallel to Vessel Imaging.  Flow velocity changes in the aorta and the middle cerebral and femoral arteries will be used to quantify the cardiovascular response to fluid shift.  Vessel Imaging aims to optimize the countermeasures used routinely during long-duration space missions.] FE-2 Revin set up & connected the TBU (Universal Bioengineering Thermostat) temperature-controlled incubator in the SM in preparation for biotechnology experiments to be delivered on Progress 48P. Activation of TBU at +4 degC is scheduled for 8/3. Afterwards, Sergei performed the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] With Gennady taking documentary photography, Malenchenko configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his first, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] In the SM, the CDR took documentary snapshots of BITS2-12 TLM (telemetry) cables behind Panel 430 to check for damage of their branches connected to temperature sensors T107 & T108 of the two 800A batteries #7 & #8.     [Originally scheduled on 7/11/12.] Later, Padalka completed another collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Gennady’s 6th time.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] FE-3 Acaba closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows to prevent their contamination from thruster effluents during the Progress 48P docking. In the JAXA JPM, Joe later reviewed procedures for the CFE VG2 (Capillary Flow Experiments / Vane Gap 2) experiment, then prepared the MWA WSA (Maintenance Work Area / Work Surface Area) and conducted  a 2h15m session of fluid test runs with the VG2 vessel.  The equipment was then torn down and stowed away.      [CFE takes advantage of the station’s micro-G environment to investigate the special dynamics of capillary flow, i.e., the interaction of liquid with solid that can draw a fluid up a narrow tube and can be exploited to control fluid orientation so that fluid systems on spacecraft perform predictably.  Joe performed the “Vane Gap 2” portion of the CFE suite, a study of capillary flow when there is a gap between interior corners of fluid containers, such as in the gap formed by an interior vane and tank wall of a large propellant storage tank, or the near intersection of vanes in a tank with a complex vane network.  Interest is in the critical wetting angles and determination of the hysteresis to a higher accuracy than before.  CFE results will have applications to management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions, and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.] Afterwards, Acaba configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 3rd session of the ESA ICV Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, assisted by Aki Hoshide in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres.  At ~12:40pm EDT, FE-3 observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.  Later in the day, Makita batteries were swapped and set up for recharge.        [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD15, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] In preparation for Progress 48P arrival, Padalka & Acaba set up the Ku-band video “scheme” for a communications test of converting the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band from SM & Node-3/Cupola, for downlinking as MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoded “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.  The wireless SSCs (Station Support Computers) on board are temporarily slowed down by the TV MPEG2 multicasting.       [Steps included connecting the SM TVS (television system) to the T61p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop at the SM CP (Central Post), activating Soyuz TVS, turning on MPEG-2 video Server 2, and monitoring the SM’s TV signal from the ground (Moscow) via Ku-band and the Cupola RWS.  The analog signal version of the digital Ku-band downlink is sent to TsUP-Moscow via ESA Gateway at COL-CC (Columbus Orbital Laboratory Control Center) on a Tandberg Decoder.] Yuri Malenchenko completed another collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Yuri’s 2nd time.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] In the JAXA Kibo laboratory, Hoshide serviced the FPEF MI (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility / Marangoni Inside) payload in the JAXA Kibo laboratory by removing & replacing 5 HDs (hard disks) of the IPU VRU (Image Processing Unit / Video Recording Unit),- #1102, #1103, #1104, #1105, #1106.    [The replaced VRU disks (#1047, #1048, #1049, #1100, #1101) were put in a Ziploc bag for return to SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center/Tsukuba)]. Aki also completed the standard 30-day inspection of the AED (Automated External Defibrillator) in the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) rack.       [AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient.  It then can treat them through defibrillation, i.e., the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.] Suni Williams configured the Lab G1 camcorder to provide live viewing of her work on the FIR FCF (Fluids Integrated Rack Fluid & Combustion Facility), then worked several hours on the ACE (Advanced Colloids Experiment) science payload in the FCF.     [ACE is an interesting Technology experiment, designed to conduct high magnification colloid experiments with the LMM (Light Microscopy Module).  Today’s activity steps included opening the FIR doors, configuring the hardware by setting up the LMM for ACE (no oil), installing an ACE sample and the AFC (Auxiliary Fluids Container) front door, then rotating the LMM Spindle Bracket Assembly to the Operate position and closing the rack doors.  The earlier onboard experiments PACE (Preliminary ACE) used the PACE LED (Light-Emitting Diode) Base to allow illumination from below the samples (or trans-illumination) to allow the ground to use the LMM microscope to examine tissue and particle samples and also characterize the microscope for ACE (Advanced Colloids Experiment) scheduled to now.   ACE Objective:  To remove gravitational jamming and sedimentation so that it is possible to observe how order arises out of disorder and to learn to control this process.  Small colloidal particles can be used to model atomic systems and to engineer new systems.  Colloids are big enough (in comparison to atoms) to be seen and big enough that their evolution can be recorded with a camera.  With a confocal microscope, templates, and grids, we can observe this process in 3-D and learn to control it.] Later, FE-5 installed an ELC (Express Logistics Carrier) jumper cable, replacing an earlier non-functioning line.     [Testing and drawing reviews have determined that the fiber optic transmit/receive lines from the EXPRESS Logistics Carriers are reversed and therefore non-operable.  The first user of this data path, the SCAN (Space Communication and Navigation) testbed, arrived on HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3).  Suni today installed a new jumper to cross the transmit/receive fibers to the proper configuration.] FE-3 reviewed uplinked reference material to prepare himself for upcoming operations with the CSA (Canadian Space Agency) BCAT-C1 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test C1) payload. At ~9:45am EDT, the six crewmembers conducted a 15-min review of Inc-32 HTV Emergency Procedures, with the objectives of familiarizing themselves with the location of HTV hardware used in emergencies and refreshing key reminders for HTV emergency responses.  The review was support by MCC-H ground specialist tagup. Later, after his 2nd wake-up (~2:00pm), Sergei Revin will complete the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Revin also takes care of the daily IMS (Inventory Maintenance System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Sergei has 2h 10m reserved for another round of filming onboard “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7E camcorder and the NIKON D2X & D3 still cameras, part of the ongoing effort to create a “Life on the Station” photo & video documentary database on the flight of ISS-32 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include running experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] Hoshide had another hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. Aki also conducted periodic maintenance of the ARED advanced resistive exercise machine, evacuating its cylinder flywheels to reestablish proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration. FE-5 & FE-6 were scheduled for their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Suni at ~9:30am, Aki at ~2:20pm EDT. Joe powered down the amateur/ham radio equipment in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and SM to prevent RF interference during Progress 48P approach & docking. Before Presleep, FE-3 turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~7:55am EDT, Padalka, Revin & Malenchenko supported Russian PAO with three TV downlinks, extending messages of greetings and congratulations to (1) the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the joint space flight of Cosmonauts A. Nikolayev and P. Popovich, (2) the International Conference PeRuSat-2012, (3) the Second Air Force Command & Air Defense Forces with the 60th anniversary of the establishment, and (4) the First International Forum "Guardianship of the Earth". Later tonight, after their 2nd wake-up at 2:00pm, Gennady & Yuri will monitor the automated approach & docking from the SM on the TORU manual teleoperated rendezvous & docking system in case automated control is aborted. After the cargo ship’s docking, CDR & FE-4 shut off TORU, and reconfigure the STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to normal ops.     [The "Voskhod-M" STTS enables telephone communications between the SM, FGB, DC-1 and USOS, and also with users on the ground over VHF channels selected by an operator at an SM comm panel, via STTS antennas on the SM’s outside.  There are six comm panels in the SM with pushbuttons for accessing any of three audio channels, plus an intercom channel.  Other modes of the STTS include telegraphy (teletype), EVA voice, emergency alarms, Packet/Email, and TORU docking support]. 48P leak checks, hatch opening and ingress are scheduled for tomorrow. The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
