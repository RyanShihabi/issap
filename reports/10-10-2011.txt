ISS On-Orbit Status 10/10/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.       Underway:  Week 4 of Increment 29 (three-person crew).   US Holiday: Columbus Day. FE-4 Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Sergey also conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. First thing in Post-sleep, Furukawa & Fossum undertook their 17th weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.        [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]  CDR Mike Fossum serviced the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) experiment, checking camera operations during the day and changing the camera battery in the morning and before sleeptime (change required after 8 hrs).  Today, Mike also replaced the flash battery.        [The current experiment session is with a Harvard University mixed sample no. 5 which requires an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) timing software, power cables and camera USB cable.  Illumination is provided by Mini-MagLite and Flash, and the camera needs freshly charged battery every 8 hrs for its automated photography, triggered by the EarthKAM software.  This requires camera battery changes twice a day and image check with a battery change once per day.  In micro-G, the mixed (alloyed) colloid sample will develop over time an increasingly coarse structure of its colloid particles which are like tiny spheres evenly dispersed in a fluid, gas or solid to help stabilize the mixture.  Over time, these colloids can move around -- known as “coarsening” -- causing changes in the concentrations and properties of the substance.  On Earth, gravity complicates this research by causing heavy components to sink and lighter ones to float.  In space, however, these forces are minute, revealing the natural movement of the colloids. The on-orbit samples' aging process works more slowly and evenly, making it easier to study.  BCAT-5 was started by Mike on 9/21 with phase separation sample no. 4.] Mike had several hours set aside to install the ARFTA (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) at the UPA WRS (Urine Processor Assembly / Water Recovery System).         [Steps included emptying the WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly) into an EDV-U to allow for room in the WSTA for DA (Distillation Assembly) dry-out and breaking out the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) modification kit for the procedure.  Afterwards, the RFTA mod kit was restowed.] FE-5 Furukawa deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.      [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] Satoshi also collected air samples with the GSC (Grab Sample Container) in the SM, Lab and JPM (JEM Pressurized Laboratory), sequenced with AK-1M air sampling by Sergey Volkov for postflight comparison. Later, FE-5 performed the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose, followed by the periodic changeout of the TOCA WWB  (Waste Water Bag).      [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Then, Furukawa collected the periodic water samples from the EHS PWD (Environmental Health Systems / Potable Water Dispenser) needle for microbial in-flight & post-flight analysis.     [The in-flight samples were processed in the MCD (microbial capture device) and CDB (coliform detection bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection.  After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] After uploading new CWQMK (Colorimetric Water Quality Monitoring Kit) firmware and upgrading the system, Satoshi subjected potable water samples to an inflight CWQMK analysis, first establishing an Iodine standard, then completing the Silver standard and analysis.      [Afterwards, data were downloaded and the CWQMK kit stowed temporarily in the CWQMK Nomex pouch.  FE-5 had protected the Iodine analysis syringe against glass breakage by placing Kapton tape on both ends.]  Sergey Volkov took his 4th MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) test, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, along with PZEh-MO-8 body mass measurement using the IM device.       [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM, the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with Sergey’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.] Later, Volkov spent ~3.5 hrs on a photo/video documentation of selected sites of the Resurs plates inside the SM’s PrK Transfer Tunnel (spherical shell cross-section).        [Objective: To evaluate access to Resurs system plates to measure electrical conductivity using the MVP-2K device.] Sergey completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying enough water supply in the KDV tank, and proper humidity of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] In the MRM2 “Poisk” module, Volkov had ~20 min set aside for inspecting clearances between the stop and the MGK hatch cover sealing hold-down roller arm of the ASP docking ring interface (where Soyuz 28S will dock in November) and took measurements of the gap.  Later, Sergey checked out the UK contact device at the hatch cover and connected it to the cabling (BKS) of the SUBA Onboard Control System.  FE-5 started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.        [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] Afterwards, Furukawa conducted the periodic check of the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) exercise machine’s four isolators for wear & tear. Satoshi also powered off and relocated the EHS / TEPC (Environmental Health Systems / Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly from the SM, Panel 327 to the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      [TEPC is the primary radiation measurement tool in the ISS.] Fossum performed maintenance on all CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) units, performing the periodic zero calibration on the combustible products sensors of all CSA-CPs and comparing their measurements.   Afterwards, Mike used CPA-CP #1003 to take O2 (oxygen) readings in the SM.  The CSA-CP readings will be used for trending of O2 levels on ISS. Satoshi opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images could be captured today by ground commanding.       [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] FE-5 also reviewing OBT (Onboard Training) material and setting up equipment for the next session with the JAXA EPO (Educational Payload Operations) LEGO Bricks payload, scheduled for building Lunar Exploration and Mars Rover models tomorrow. Afterwards, Furukawa performed the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 20 min (during which WHC was not available). Mike Fossum later reconfigured the WHC from feeding the internal EDV-U container to supplying the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) directly for processing. Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sergey also completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. COL Ventilation Test:      Today, COL-CC (Columbus Orbital Laboratory Control Center) performed a set of COL air loop tests to assess CFA 1 (Cabin Fan Assembly 1) stability and to test two three-fan configurations for ISS Decrewing.  The test ran from 4:15am to 12:35pm EDT.  During the tests, the crew was to minimize their presence in COL to mitigate impacting the test results.  JAXA Marangoni Experiment:    The crew was advised of another Marangoni bridge building event tonight (7:00pm-1:00am), the 11th in 24 planned bridge buildings in Increment 29/30.  The experiment is performed in the Kibo JPM during crew sleep (since the liquid bridge to be formed is sensitive to g-jitter), 4 days/week at most and 24 runs in total.  After the liquid bridge has been formed, the ground imposes a temperature gradient on it to produce Marangoni convection.   The crew, which is being informed regularly, has been asked to avoid any disturbances in this timeframe.  Even disturbances in other modules can be transmitted and cause the liquid bridge in JPM to break up, resulting in science loss. No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
