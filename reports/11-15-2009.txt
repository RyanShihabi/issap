ISS On-Orbit Status 11/15/09  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday – a full-rest day for the crew.   Ahead: Week 6 of Increment 21.  FE-1 Suraev did the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which he had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-1 again inspects the filters tonight at bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  FE-5 Williams supported once again the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]   The crewmembers performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]  As part of the house cleaning, Suraev & FE-3 Romanenko conducted regular maintenance inspection & cleaning on fan screens, Group A, in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and SM (VPkhO, VPrK, FS5, FS6 & FS9).  Suraev also did the periodic checkup behind ASU panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.  The FE-1 completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]  With the UPA (Urine Processing Assembly) hard failed, FE-2 offloaded the WSTA (Waste Storage Tank Assembly) to 2% to prepare for the upcoming removal of the failed (DA) Distillation Assembly.    [For the draining, Nicole donned silver shield gloves, dust mask and goggles then operated the Pre-treated Urine T-Valve to offload the urine to an EDV-U container.]  Stott also prepared for the replacement of the failed HRF USND (Human Research Facility / Ultrasound) board by removing bolts from the USND front panel.  Using the WRS FTP (Water Recovery System / Fluid Transfer Pump), Jeff Williams transferred stored water to supplement the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) Waste Water Tank.  Thirsk checked and photographed the new Sample 7 of the BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) Crystal experiment in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).    [This activity was performed daily during BCAT-5 operations to check for crystals, but is not required now after crystals have been found.]  The six crewmembers had the weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) on their schedules, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Roman at ~ 6:30am, Frank at ~9:00am, , Maxim at ~9:45am, Bob at ~10:30am, Nicole at ~12:35pm, Jeff at ~1:00pm EST.  The crew performed their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-2, FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), T2 treadmill (CDR, FE-4) and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).  Suggested work items on Maxim’s & Roman’s Russian discretionary task list for today were –  A photography run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D2X digital camera (with 800mm telelens),A session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the Nikon D2X with the SIGMA 300-800mm telephoto lens,More photography for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, to obtain data on color field patterns and current cloud cover conditions over dynamic ocean areas, andThe periodic status check & water tank refill on the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment in the SM where plants, currently Mizuna, are studied under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-16 greenhouse.    STS-129/Atlantis Flight Plan Overview:   Launch, Docking, Undocking & Landing data see below;STS-129/ULF3/Atlantis will be crewed by CDR Charlie “Scorch” Hobaugh, PLT Barry “Butch” Wilmore, MS1 Leland Melvin, MS2 Randy Bresnik, MS3 Mike Forman, MS4 Bobby Satcher, FE-2/MS5 Nicole Stott (down);Nicole will officially be considered a Shuttle crewmember at hatch opening on FD3 - but will continue to live on ISS until the day before undocking, being scheduled (timelined) as an ISS crewmember. ISS Crew Wake will shift forward (later) to 3:00am EST on FD 2 (11/17) and then to 4:30am on FDs 3&4. Undock will drive Crew Wake two-and-a-half hours earlier to 02:00am by FD9 (Hatch Close Day). This shift is accomplished by moving Crew Sleep 30 min earlier on FDs 4-8.  Crew Wake is 2:00am again on FD 10 (Undock Day) with sleep at 4:30pm, completing the shift back to the nominal wake/sleep cycle.  Wake/Sleep schedule:        FD Date GMT WAKE EST (am) SLEEP EST (pm)    FD1 16-Nov 320 1:00 4:30   FD2 17-Nov 321 3:00 8:00   FD3 18-Nov 322 4:30 8:00   FD4 19-Nov 323 4:30 7:30   FD5 20-Nov 324 4:00 7:00   FD6 21-Nov 325 3:30 6:30   FD7 22-Nov 326 3:00 6:00   FD8 23-Nov 327 2:30 5:30   FD9 24-Nov 328 2:00 5:30   FD10 25-Nov 329 2:00 4:30     Focused inspection is nominally planned for FD5. On the evening of FD3, the Debris Assessment Team will start reviewing the RPM imagery.  Late inspection will be completed in its entirety after the Shuttle undocks on FD10.Three EVAs are planned during the mission on FD’s 4, 6, & 8.  Nicole and Butch will support the EVA Prep & Post responsibilities.General tasks for each EVA:  EVA 1 (Forman/Satcher):  Transfer SASA (S-Band Antenna Support Assembly) from PLB to Z1, lubricate POA & JEM RMS, install NH3 BRKT, route & install SGANT (Space to Ground Antenna) cable, troubleshoot S01/4 cable.EVA 2 (Forman/Bresnik):  Install GATOR (Grapple Adaptor To On-Orbit Railing), deploy S3 Nadir PAS (Payload Attachment System), relocate FPMU (Floating Potential Measurement Unit, install WETA (Wireless Video System External Transceiver Assembly).EVA 3 (Bresnik/Satcher):  Transfer HPGT (High Pressure Gas Tank) from ELC2 to ISS Airlock, install MISSE 7 (Materials International Space Station Experiment 7 on ELC2, deploy S3 Zenith Inboard PAS.  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
