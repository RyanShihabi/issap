ISS On-Orbit Status 03/02/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FD7 (Flight Day 7) of STS-133/ULF-5.  Sleep cycle shift:  Crew wake/sleep cycle continues to shift. Current schedule for ISS crew (EST): DateWAKESLEEP3/25:23am8:23pm3/34:53am7:53pm3/44:23am7:23pm3/53:53am4:33pm3/62:53am4:03pm3/71:00am4:30pm  Mission ULF-5’s EVA-2 was completed successfully by EV1 Steve Bowen & EV2 Alvin Drew in 6h 14m, accomplishing all objectives (although the spacewalk was terminated ahead of schedule due to EV2 Drew’s EHIP/EMU Helmet Interchangeable Portable light becoming loose at about 5h 15m into the EVA).  Beginning this morning at 10:42am EST, the spacewalk ended at 4:56pm.        [EV1 & EV2 began their “campout” last night in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) at ~7:48pm with hatch closure and depressurization of the Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe (~7:48pm-8:53pm) and sleep from 9:23pm-6:03am.  After wake-up this morning and the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Drew & Bowen at 6:03am-7:13am, the A/L hatch was closed again by Paolo Nespoli & Mike Barratt for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge and prebreathe in the EMUs.  The crew experienced a suit leak on Bowen’s EMU and tracked it down to be a damaged o-ring on the LiOH (lithium hydroxide) can (#2012) outlet.  After swapping o-rings, the suit passed the leak check, about 15 min behind schedule.  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-2 began at 10:42am.  The excursion lasted 6h 14m.] During EVA-2, Bowen & Drew –Vented NH3 (ammonia) from the failed PM (Pump Module), ~11:22am Retrieved the LWAPA (lightweight adapter plate assembly) & stowed it in the cargo bay, Removed MLI (multi-layer insulation) on the ELC4 electronic box (EXPCA (EXPRESS Logistics Carrier 4 / EXPRESS Carrier Avionics),Retrieved stowage bags left on CETA (Crew Equipment Translation Aid) cart after stage EVAs that replaced the PM,Installed a light in the P3 (port) CETA cart,Installed the CLPA1 (Camera, Light, PTU Assembly 1) unit on the SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator), Removed MLI cover from SPDM EP1,Repaired MLI on P1 (port) RBVM (Radiator Beam Valve Module),Performed troubleshooting on loose P1 RGFSBs (Radiator Grapple Fixture Stowage Beams), installed on STS-131, Removed MLI on Node-3 power cables, and Installed lens covers on the CLPAs of the SPDM, SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) and POA (Payload ORU Accommodation). Before today’s EVA-2, FE-6 Coleman –Powered down the amateur/ham radio equipment to prevent RF interference with the spacewalkers’ radio (to be turned back on tonight),Closed the protective shutter of the Lab science window,Activated the VSWs (Video Streaming Workstations) and SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops for the video “scheme” for downlinking “streaming video” packets via the MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder, U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band, andPerformed a final test on the two NIKON D2Xs EVA cameras for Steve & Alvin. Also preparatory to the spacewalk, CDR Kelly -Inhibited the CUCU (COTS UHF Communications Unit) in the Lab (at O4) by opening four circuit breakers,Set up & verified the RWS (Robotic Workstation) and DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) peripherals with the IPV (International Procedures Viewer) laptop to support SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) ops andVerified that both payload outlet switches (DN1, DN2) on the EPF PPSB (External Payload Facility / Payload Power Switch Box) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) were in the Off position (as required for LWAPA de-installation by Steve Bowen).  During the spacewalk, Kelly & Barratt again operated the SSRMS “Canadarm-2” which supported Steve Bowen in retrieving & stowing LWAPA, installing the SPDM CLPA1 and removing SPDM EP1 MLI. As spacewalk “choreographer” or IV (Intravehicular) officer inside the station, Nicole Stott provided support to the spacewalkers.   Steve Lindsey was in charge of photo/video activities. After the EVA, Cady Coleman –Deactivated the VSWs (Video Streaming Workstation) &  associated SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops as required,Downloaded the EVA images including the standard post-EVA photographs of the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) gloves for ground inspection, andPowered up the amateur/ham radio equipment. Paolo Nespoli re-configured the C&T (Command & Tracking) video set-up in Node-2, installing the video cap which enables pass-through reception of video from the Discovery with the Orbiter docked in support of SSRMS ops during crew sleep. Other post-ingress activities, by Barratt, Bowen, Drew & Nespoli, included the usual post-EVA tasks like A/L clean-up, photographing EMU gloves, recharging EMUs with water, recharging REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly) batteries, etc. Early this morning, FE-2 Skripochka undertook the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] At wake-up, FE-4 Kondratyev terminated his 8th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking & brushing teeth, Cady Coleman performed her 3rd liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 2).  The collections are made every other day for six days.       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] FE-2 Skripochka activated & verified proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM (Service Module) which is taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle-docked phase.  The data were later copied to a USB stick, the archive cleared, and the data downlinked to the ground.  DAKON was then rebooted for another run.      [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.] Skripochka also completed the periodic (currently daily) checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.  This checkup is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently twelve persons.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]. FE-4 Kondratyev & FE-1 Kaleri worked the major portion of the day on Part 2 of the extensive R&R (removal & replacement) of the Vozdukh CO2 (carbon dioxide) removal assembly in the SM.  After yesterday’s deinstallation & removal of the old Vozdukh BOA valve panel, the IFM (Inflight Maintenance) today was focused on installing the spare BOA with plug-in assemblies & units plus BOA leak checking, supported by ground specialist tagup.  Skripochka replaced P-16 filter cartridges.       [Part 3, mating electrical connections, installing acoustic protection, evacuating, and activation for functionality checkout will then close out the labor tomorrow.  Vozdukh reactivation is expected tomorrow at about 10:00am EST.  Dmitri is in charge of the work, but many of the tasks are done by ground control from TsUP-Moscow.] The CDRA (CO2 Removal Assembly) in the US Lab meanwhile continues to operate, but on secondary heaters only.  Partial pressure (pp) CO2 remains within flight rule limits.  Tomorrow (3/3), the crew will make the CDRA in Node-3 (AR rack) operational by installing the new CDRA bed that arrived on ULF5 and replacing ASV (Air Selector Valve) 103 that has caused CDRA to fail.     [The two ASVs regulate air flow into the regenerable desiccant/sorbent beds.] After Cady Coleman set up the Lab camcorder to provide live coverage, FE-5 Nespoli completed his current service support of the FIR FCF (Fluids Integrated Rack / Fluids & Combustion Facility).     [For today’s activity, Paolo again had to open the rack doors and rotate the LMM SBA (Light Microscopy Module / Spindle Bracket Assembly) from the Operate to Service position.  Having reconfigured the LMM yesterday by removing two objective lenses with extenders and replacing them with three new objective lenses without extenders, FE-5 then installed the Bio kit and set up a Bio sample on the Bio Base, then rotated the SBA back to Operate, closed the upper & lower FCF rack doors, and notified POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) that the rack was ready for RPC (Remote Power Controller) activation.  The LMM-Bio experiment is designed for autonomous operation through scripts and ground-based commanding.  Crew time is required for the initial installation and check out in the FIR, sample change out, and removal from the FIR.] FE-6 initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer) and deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [This was the 22nd session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] Cady Coleman, Eric Boe & Steve Lindsey spent several hours on outfitting the newly arrived PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module).  Leonardo, now permanently docked at the Node-1 nadir port, was ingressed first by Scott Kelly & Steve Lindsey last evening at ~6:30pm EST.    [Today’s activities focused on preparing the PMM aisleway by relocating cargo such as the new treadmill, CCAA (Common Cabin Air Assembly) heat exchanger, Robonaut with its accessories, diverse fences & straps to the PMM endcone (opposite the hatch end), and relocating a ZSR (Zero-G Stowage Rack) from the Lab (loc. P1) to the PMM (at P1) along with CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) stowed behind the ZSR.  ZSR installation required installation of pivot fittings & standoff brackets at PMM P1.  Foam, packing material and other trash is being moved to the HTV-2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 2) for disposal.] Oleg Skripochka set up the Russian TEKh-38 VETEROK (“Breeze”) science hardware and then used it to take air ion concentration measurements in the middle section of MRM1 Rassvet, MRM2 Poisk and SM, about 20 cm away from panels and near the transfer hatch of each module.  Data were taken in two blocks of 1h 15m each with a break of ~2 hrs in between and entered on log sheets.      [Veterok uses an air scrubber fan (VOV), air ion concentration meter (IKAR-1) and anemometer-thermometer (TAN-1) for measuring charged particles at various locations near the running VOV.  The experiment studies the implementation of alternative methods for cleaning & revitalizing the atmosphere by pumping the air with an electrostatic fan through an electric filter and saturating the airflow with light air ions of positive and negative polarity, which may solve the problem of removing organic trace contaminants from the air, both in the entire station volume and in the space behind the panels.  Measurements were taken with IKAR-1 and TAN-1 of particle field polarity (plus/minus), concentration, temperature & velocity and downloaded to the RSE-1 laptop.] Later, Oleg completed another data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Oleg’s 10th run.    [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] FE-6 Coleman accessed the WRS (Water Recovery System) and reconfigured the setup for the periodic RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) backfill with a QD (Quick Disconnect) hose, which was then stowed and the RFTA activity closed out, Coleman also performed the frequent regular module data take on the CubeLab and transferred files of collected data to laptop for downlink.      [CubeLab is a low-cost 1-kg platform for educational projects.  It is a multipurpose research facility that interfaces small standard modules into the ERs (EXPRESS Racks).  The modules can be used within the pressurized space station environment in orbit, with a nominal length, width, and height of 100 mm and a mass of no more than 1 g.  Up to 16 CubeLab modules can be inserted into a CubeLab insert inside an ER.] Later, Cady began gathering equipment and making preparations for tomorrow’s major CDRA maintenance, during which she and Scott Kelly will install a new CDRA bed in Node-3 in the AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) rack in the front location (Bed 202), along with a new air selector valve. Dmitri Kondratyev conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Oleg Skripochka handed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), Alex Kaleri initiated overnight (10-hr) charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery for the Piren-V Pyro-endoscope, part of the Russian BAR science instruments suite (other BAR components being the ТТМ-2 Anemometer-Thermometer, the charger cable, and the video display unit).      [Piren-V, a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, is part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Besides Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] Before sleeptime, Sasha will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 12th Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth. Also before sleeptime, Scott Kelly & Eric Boe will reconfigure the oxygen) transfer equipment from supplying O2 from Discovery to the ISS PBA (Prebreathe Assembly) ports to supplying it to the ISS O2 tanks, and then initiate the overnight transfer. The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).        [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is done regularly after the last T2 session of the day.] Middeck Transfers:   Middeck supply transfers are 92% complete and return transfers are 60% complete.  Overall transfer completion: 76%. Stack Reboost:    Tomorrow morning at 9:03am EST, a one-burn stack reboost by the Shuttle VRCS (Vernier Reaction Control System) thrusters will be conducted for a duration of 26 minutes and a delta-V of 1.1 m/s (3.3 ft/s).
