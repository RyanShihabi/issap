ISS On-Orbit Status 03/20/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After breakfast, FE-4 Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-5 Kuipers started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] FE-2 Ivanishin completed his 6th session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.    [Shkaplerov stood by to assist Anatoly in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] After last week’s routing & installing of cabling for the HRCS (High Rate Communication System) in the Lab forward endcone, CDR Burbank today had ~2 hrs set aside to install a HRCS AV-2 connector panel at loc. D1.     [The panel carries 16 connector plugs, to which Dan mated 9 JSL (Joint Station LAN) Ethernet cables (W9690) of the Ku-CU (Ku-band Comm Unit) and 6 PEHG 1/APS (Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway 1/Automated Payload Switch) data cables (W9679).  When fully installed and operational, HRCS will provide substantially faster uplink & downlink speeds, improved bandwidth, two extra S/G (Space/Ground) voice loops, two extra video downlink channels, and contingency Ku Commanding capability.  It will also allow additional data to be downlinked from the P/L (Payload) and C&C (Command & Control) MDMs through Ku-band using the MDM Ethernet cables routed by the crew during the EPIC (Enhanced Processor & Integrated Communications) work completed earlier in the Increment.  This new functionality will be achieved through three major upgrades: Improved APS (Automated Payload Switch) installations (already completed during Increment 28), improved PEHG (Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway) installations, and the Ku-CU installations.  The PEHG and Ku-CU installations are not scheduled until at least October 2012.  To prepare for their arrival, a number of cable routing and other tasks are required and are being done early, today’s one being one of them.] Anton Shkaplerov spent ~2.5 hrs with the KPT-2 payload and its BAR science instruments suite, using the AU-1 (Ultrasound Analyzer 1) to measure background noise near valves and in the window areas of SM, PkhO (Transfer Compartment) and DC1.  AU-1 can detect and locate tiny leaks by listening for “hissing” noise.  [KPT-2 monitors problem areas, necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data are copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities are supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] Anton also conducted the regular transfer of US condensate water from CWC (Collapsible Water Container) to the RS (Russian Segment) for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container (#1000).  Once filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [Condensate was drawn from CWC #1039.  The 40-minute procedure is specially designed for gas/liquid separation, i.e., to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the Elektron’s BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.] In Node-3, Dan Burbank worked several hours troubleshooting the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Container), looking for an air leak in the flush water lines and water valve block.  If the air bubble source was found, the affected part was to be replaced.      [Background: On 3/17 (Saturday), a “Pre-Treat Bad Qual” light came on in the WHC, indicating that the pretreat-water solution concentration was out of the acceptable range. The crew, which used the Russian ASU overnight, also observed air bubbles, as well as darker than normal color in the diluted pretreat line, which is consistent with excessive air bubbles coming from the WHC flush tank.  After removing & replacing the WHC flush tank on Sunday, the “Bad Qual” light and air bubble issues reappeared.  Today’s activity was part of the ongoing troubleshooting.] After setting up the necessary equipment in the morning, FE-6 Pettit was the subject for his 2nd session with the periodic 30-min US PHS (Periodic Health Status)/Without Blood Labs exam, with FE-5 Kuipers acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Afterwards, Don assumed the CMO job to assist André with his 2nd PHS w/o Blood Labs session.  FE-5 then logged the data and stowed the equipment.  A subjective evaluation was part of the test.    [The assessment used the AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack), stethoscope, oral disposable thermometer and ABPC (Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff) from the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack).  All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.  The PHS exam is guided by special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.] Ivanishin checked on proper functionality of the Russian RS1 laptop. Afterwards, Anatoly completed another 30-min. session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. FE-6 Pettit had ~30 min to review procedures & messages required for the upcoming (3/22) software load activities on the ER4 RIC (EXPRESS Rack 4 / Rack Interface Controller). Dan Burbank undertook the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics.  At the end, the CDR completed a self-assessment questionnaire.  Answers were provided at test conclusion.  (Deferred from yesterday).       [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] Shkaplerov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anton also took on the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Setting up the Lulin-ISS radiation hardware for a checkout to allow extending its operations warranty, Anatoly activated & deployed the 4 Lulin dosimeters after their overnight recharge.     [Lulin-ISS is a part of the complex Matryoshka suite designed for sophisticated radiation studies.]  André & Don had several hours between them for more cleaning up work in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), intent on relocating cargo from the PMM rack front and endcone areas to utilize space in the operationally most efficient manner.     [The relocations move trash out of PMA-1 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 1) to make room for clothing CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags), consolidate food stores and minimize the stowage on the rack fronts that will be accessed during ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) unloading.] Anton completed his 10th data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.         [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] Pettit collected the periodic water sample (~300 mL) from the WRS WPA MF (Water Recovery System / Water Processor Assembly / Multi-Filtration), after flushing the line with ~150 mL. Kuipers undertook the periodic manual transfer of urine from an EDV-U container (#1028, then #974) to the UPA WSTA (Urine Processor Assembly / Waste Storage Tank Assembly) for UPA processing.       [During such transfers, the crewmember always wears protective safety goggles, dust mask and nitrile gloves.] André also prepared the CDL HLTA BP (Cardiolab Holter Arterial Blood Pressure) kit for tomorrow’s scheduled CARD (Long Term Microgravity:  Model for Investigating Mechanisms of Heart Disease) experiment by inserting fresh AA batteries (minimum of 16 hrs before session start). Dan Burbank later performed maintenance on the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) in Node-3 by hooking up the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) in the WRS2 (Water Recovery System 2) rack for the periodic tank backfill with a QD (Quick Disconnect) hose for processing, then closed out the worksite. The CDR again had a time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]Before Presleep, Burbank will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4).       [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for T2, with ARED+T2 & CEVIS following in the next 2 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Laganakskoe plateau, Krasnaya Polyana, Allalin & Kolka Glaciers, and the volcanoes Cleveland, Kilimanjaro, Popocatepetl, Santa Maria, Fuego, San Cristobal, Tangaraua, Sangay & Huascaran;A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Yerevan, Armenia (World Capitals Collection Site: The ancient Armenian capital city of over 1.1 million is located in the southwestern part of the country on the north edge of the agricultural region of the Ararat River Valley.  ISS had a nadir pass at midday with fair weather expected.  At this time as ISS approached the ranges of the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, the crew was to look for this urban target), Vaduz, Liechtenstein (World Capital Collection Site: Looking just left of track for the capital city of the principality of Liechtenstein.  The city is located in a large valley on the banks of the Rhine River.  Overlapping mapping frames were suggested to obtain imagery of this capital city), Niamey, Niger (World Capitals Collection Site: The capital city of Niger with a population of about 800,000 lies on a broad bend of the Niger River as it bisects a plateau in the extreme southwestern part of the country.  Today ISS had an early afternoon pass in fair weather.  At this time as the station approached from the NW, the crew was to look just right of track and try for contextual views of this city within a single frame), and Sydney, Australia (Cities at Night: Sydney is the most populous city in Australia with approximately 4.6 million people.  As the crew tracked NE over Australia’s southeastern coast, they were to look slightly left of track to acquire this city at night.  Such images hold high value for the mapping of cityscapes and for quantitative estimates of population).
