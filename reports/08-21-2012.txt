ISS On-Orbit Status 08/21/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Sleep cycle shift:  To make up for yesterday’s long work day due to the Russian EVA-31, the crew’s sleeptime this morning was extended by 4 hrs (i.e., wakeup at 6:00am (instead of 2:00am EDT). Regular sleeptime returns tonight at 5:30pm. At wakeup, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Upon wakeup, FE-5 Sunita Williams & FE-6 Akihiko Hoshide completed their currently daily post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, their 12th.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-6 Hoshide reached midpoint at about 12:30pm EDT for his on-going 2nd Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) assessment, after which he began the second 24h data collection period, with Makita batteries swapped and recharged during the day.       [For the second 24 hr period, the Cardiopres was temporarily doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery were changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).  (ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.)] In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Akihiko later worked on the MSPR (Multipurpose Small Payload Rack), supporting the ground by activating MSPR components VRU (Video Compression & Recording Unit), Hub and ELT (Experiment Laptop Terminal) for the new JAXA AQH (Aquatic Habitat) payload to enable functional checkouts of ELT & AQH from the ground. Before sleeptime, Aki will deactivate the components again.     [The JAXA AQH is a closed-water circulatory system, which provides a new facility option ISS-based research. Scientists will use the habitat to study small, freshwater fish on orbit. For the first investigations, they plan to examine the Medaka fish (Oryzias latipes), looking at the impacts of radiation, bone degradation, muscle atrophy, and developmental biology. The investigations could last up to 90 days and provide data that may lead to a better understanding of related human health concerns here on Earth. Medaka fish are ideal specimens for many reasons. They are transparent, making it easy to view the inner workings of their organs. They also breed quickly and easily in micro-G environments, enabling multi-generation studies. Researchers can take advantage of a variety of genetic modifications to these fish, as well. Also, scientists already have all of the Medaka genome identified, which makes it easier to recognize any alterations to the fishes’ genes, due to factors like space radiation.] Gennady Padalka & Yuri Malenchenko re-integrated the ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) with the ISS by –·        Performing a leak check of the interface between the PrK (Transfer Tunnel) at the SM aft end and the ATV on TsUP/Moscow Go (CDR),·        Opening the PrK-SU (vestibule) transfer hatch, (CDR+FE-4)·        Opening the ATV3 hatch, (CDR+FE-4)·        Installing the BZV Q/D (quick disconnect) screw clamps (CDR+FE-4), and·        Deactivating the ESA cargo vehicle (CDR). Later, Padalka & Malenchenko shared in –·        Emptying the Orlan-MK suit water supply lines for dry-out,·        Setting up the Orlan-MKs and gloves for drying,·        Refilling the Orlan feedwater bladders,·        Removing the Orlan-worn “Pille” radiation dosimeters for taking post-EVA readings and attaching them to their continuous wear clothes,·        Returning the medical First Aid Kits from the DC1 to their regular stowage sites,·        Downlinking the EVA photographs to the ground via RSPI or OCA, and·        Transferring the US EVA tools used during the EVA-31 from the RS (Russian Segment) to the USOS for handover to FE-6 Hoshide. Gennady also prepared the BIO-2 BIORISK-MSN container, retrieved during the spacewalk, for return to Earth by closing its vents and enclosing it in its cover. After visually inspecting & activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility (later deactivating it) and adjusting the video camera, FE-5 Sunita Williams started another session with the BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids) experiment, conducting multiple flame test runs on two samples (a flat acrylic and a flat wax sample, both facing the nitrogen nozzle with their open edges), starting digital photography, exchanging the digital tapes in the MSG VTR1 (Video Tape Recorder 1) & VTR2 and performing a fan calibration to evaluate the air flow with the new fan flow constrictor installed.  Afterwards the A31p laptop was turned off and the MSG put on Standby.       [BASS uses SLICE equipment but burns solid fuel samples instead of gaseous jets.  Sample will either be ignited one time and then replaced with a new one, or burn multiple times.  The four servicing procedures, ops prep, BASS ops, BASS fan calibration & BASS videotape exchange, are now no longer listed separately on the crew timeline but consolidated in one activity.  BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity.  It will also guide strategies for extinguishing accidental fires in micro-G.  Results will contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in space and on Earth.] Later, Suni performed the continuing preventive inspection & cleaning of accessible AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) system bacteria filters in Node-1, Node-2 & Node-3. FE-3 Acaba disassembled the Lab RWS (Robotic Workstation) setup in the Lab, disconnecting the DCP (Display & Control Panel) power cable. Afterwards, Joe assisted FE-6 Hoshide in assembling the JEMRMS MPEP (JEM Robotic Maneuvering System Multi-Purpose Experiment Platform) in the Kibo laboratory. Aki then attached the MPEP to the SAM (Small Fine Arm Attachment Mechanism) on the JEM airlock’s table after sliding it out into the cabin through the open JEMAL (JEM Airlock) inner hatch, verified & checked out proper installation and then pushed back the slide table and closed the inner hatch.  Acaba meanwhile –·        Deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground;  [two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow],·        Started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later;   [consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],·        Restowed the battery pantry bags audited & consolidated yesterday during his isolation in MRM2,·        Collected air samples with new GSCs (Grab Sample Containers) in the center of SM, Lab and COL, sequenced with the AQM sampling for postflight comparison;  [GSC samples are taken 1-3 hrs after AQM start],·        Completed his 4th session with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application;  [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies],·        Replaced the full RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) in the Node-3 WRS-2 (Water Recovery System) Rack 2 with a new unit retrieved from stowage;  [RFTAs collect the substances cleaned from the pretreated urine by the UPA as it turns it into water.  They need to be replaced when filled and constitute an important resupply item from the ground], and·        Reconfigured ATV3 cargo stowage by relocating two M-01 bags (#1024, #1014) from S2 rack front to D1 rack front to allow for upcoming ATV3 gas transfer. FE-2 Revin started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, today working in the SM for about 2h 30m for cleaning its numerous Group A ventilator fans & grilles. Later, Revin completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-2 also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur) Afterwards, Sergei undertook his 4th regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas, The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics.  At the end, Revin completed a self-assessment questionnaire.  Answers were provided at test conclusion.       [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] FE-6 performed regular maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), inspecting and greasing its VIS (Vibration Isolation System) Y- & Z-axes rails & rollers and upper stops. Aki also closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & Kibo windows to prevent their contamination from thruster effluents during tomorrow morning’s ISS/ATV reboosts. At ~1:35pm EDT, Williams, Acaba & Hoshide discussed the upcoming US EVA-18 (8/30) in a 30-min teleconference with spacewalk specialists at MCC-Houston. CDR & FE-4 conducted their post-EVA PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Yuri at ~11:10am, Gennady at ~12:10am.  Also, Sergei Revin had his regular weekly PMC at ~2:40pm. Before Presleep, FE-3 Acaba turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with an abbreviated protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5).      [FE-5 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Suni picks up where she left off, i.e., she would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Today, her SPRINT exercise continued with T2 (aerobic, interval 30s), with ARED/T2 and T2 (Kinematics, 2 min) following in the next 2 days.] ISS/ATV Reboosts:   Tomorrow (8/22), the ISS is scheduled to perform two successive reboosts using the ATV3 OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters, the first at 5:45am EDT (burn duration: 6 min 24 sec; expected delta-V: 0.90 m/sec; delta-H: 1.56 km), the second at 9:17am (34 min 49 sec; 4.90 m/sec; 8.56 km).  The purpose of the reboosts is to set up the phasing conditions for the Soyuz 30S landing in mid-September and Progress 49P accelerated (4-orbit) rendezvous on 10/31.  Burn duration: 31 min 16 sec. Progress M-15M/47P Deorbit:  Yesterday at 11:17am EDT, Progress 47P performed its 87.1 m/sec deorbit burn.  Surviving pieces impacted at ~12:12pm in the Pacific.  47P had undocked from the ISS on 7/30 and remained in orbit to perform stand-alone Radar-Progress experiment burns. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Aral Sea, central Asia (looking immediately left and trying for contextual, short-lens views to document the current state), Rome, Italy (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  Looking right.  Rome [2.8 million people] lies just south of the circular Lake di Bracciano), San Marino, San Marino (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  Looking left near the Adriatic coast.  Best visual cue is the small but prominent bay on the coast at Rimini: San Marino is located about 20 miles to the SW), La Paz, Bolivia (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  Looking just left for La Paz.  The more visible part of the La Paz metro area [2.36 million population] lies on the high Andean plain [altitude 11,975 feet], with the airport as its most prominent visual feature.
