ISS Reboost: Today, the ISS performed a reboost using the Aft Progress 81P R&D thrusters. This reboost was the second of three reboosts to set up proper constraints for 68S 2-orbit rendezvous on September 21 and 67S landing on September 29. The burn duration was 5 minutes 33 seconds with a Delta-V of 0.68 m/s.
Payloads:
Actiwatch Plus (AWP): The crew removed their Actiwatches, verified they were still in the correct data collection mode, and then stowed them. The data on the watches will be transferred at a later time. The Actiwatch is a waterproof, non-intrusive, sleep-wake activity monitor worn on the wrist of a crewmember. It contains a miniature uniaxial accelerometer that produces a signal as the subject moves. The data is stored in non-volatile memory within the Actiwatch until they are downloaded for analysis.
Systems:
COL Payload Laptop Power Swap and LAN Connection: The crew changed the power chain of ZBook ‘COL_Payload_Laptop 1’ and connected the European Physiology Module (EPM) Laptop LAN Cable to the laptop.
