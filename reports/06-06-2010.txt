ISS On-Orbit Status 06/06/10   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Sunday – Crew rest day.   Ahead: Week 1 of Increment 24.  ·         Today 39 years ago (June 6, 1971), Soyuz-11 launched the first crew of the world’s first space station, Salyut 1 – Vladislav Volkov, Georgi Dobrovolski & Viktor Patsayev.  On June 30, all crewmembers died during reentry when their capsule depressurized during reentry preparations.   ·         Also today, 44 years ago (1966), Gemini 9 with Thomas P. Stafford & Eugene A. Cernan splashed down in the Pacific after 47 orbits.    At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]   First thing in the morning, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued her current 4-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 3rd onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  This session will be closed out today at ~6:30pm EDT.      [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]   Additionally, Tracy started on her FD60 (Flight Day 60) Nutrition/Repository/Pro K generic urine collections which will end tomorrow after a 24-hour run. Samples are being secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).   Mikhail Kornienko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module).     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   Tracy, Misha & Sasha completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).   CDR & FE-2 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Tracy at ~7:30am, Alexander at ~10:40am EDT.   Jobs listed for Skvortsov & Kornienko today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –  Another ~40-min. run of      the GFI-8      "Uragan"      (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D2X digital camera      photography with 800mm telelens (Targets: detailed photography of the      Caucasus tallest mountain peaks; estuary of Terek; oil slicks in the      Caspian Sea; oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico), A ~30-min. photography      session for the DZZ-13      “Seiner”      ocean observation program, obtaining data on oceanic water blooms in the      waters of North-West Africa, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, and A ~30-min. session for      Russia's EKON Environmental      Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of      environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera.   IPS MDSC Outage Update:     After the ~7-hour overnight downtime of the IPS MDSC (Integrated Planning System Mission Data Server Computer) with its numerous ISS services for necessary upgrade work, tonight’s time slot for the operation, reserved as backup, was cancelled.    No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
