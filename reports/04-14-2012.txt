ISS On-Orbit Status 04/14/12 >>>Today 31 years ago (1981), STS-1 Columbia (OV-102), the first operational Space Shuttle, returned from orbit piloted by John Young and Robert Crippen, successfully completing its first test flight.<<< All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – Crew off duty. After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Upon wakeup, CDR Dan Burbank, FE-5 André Kuipers & FE-6 Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 41st for Dan, the 35th for André & Don.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] As generally on Saturdays, the six crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM. Anton also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] The CDR conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Anton Shkaplerov & Anatoly Ivanishin completed their 2nd preliminary orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test runs with the Russian Chibis suit in preparation for their return to gravity on 4/27 with Soyuz 28S (along with Dan Burbank), conducting the ODNT exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill.  Oleg Kononenko acted as CMO (Crew Medical Officer for both crewmembers as Subjects.   FE-1 & FE-2 were supported in their one-hour sessions by ground specialist tagup and telemetry downlinks via VHF at 6:53am & 8:30am EDT, resp.        [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  The preparatory training consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -20, -25, -30, and -35 mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG ShKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap, supported by the Gamma-1M biomed data control system.   The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] Pettit, Kuipers & Burbank filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Don’s & André’s 13th, Dan’s 19th.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~9:00am EDT, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~11:30am, Oleg, Anatoly & Anton supported a Russian PAO TV downlink, transmitting greetings and congratulations to the participants of the “Star Race” space-related science, technology & art competition finals, opening on 4/23 at the Y. A. Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in Star City. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-4).     [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+TK (Treadmill Kinematics), with CEVIS, ARED+T2, T2, ARED+T2, CEVIS & TK following in the next 6 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  FE-6 Pettit performed a session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  Dan Burbank then downlinked the video via MPC.        [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] After his T2 session, CDR Burbank closed down the T2 software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display. Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Volcanoes Tambora, Ranak, Lock-Empung, Gamalama, Karangetan, Ibu Dukono, Marapi, Hudson & Popocatepetl,  and the Patagonian glaciers Upsala, Viedma and Chico;·        A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Eastern Pacific, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,·        Recording high-resolution video with the SONY HVR-Z7E to be used in a joint project of Roskosmos TV Studio with Karusel (Carousel) TV Channel for children ages 8 to 12 years, the “It’s Time to go to space!” program, which has a segment where Russian cosmonauts are discussing their work &, answer viewers’ questions; the footage was then to be downlinked to TsUP-Moscow,·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty/Thirty-One -- Week 28). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):    The experiment is continuing in Dewar 4 of MELFI-1.

BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):   We installed the previously-burned 2-cm diameter PMMA sphere.  The sample was ignited and extinguished three separate times, yielding 3 tests points.  All ignitions occurred at an air flow speed of 10 cm/s.  Don did a nice job establishing the smallest flame possible, at which time the flow speed was decreased to less than 5 cm/s.  The flame modelers are most interested in the blue flame growth right after ignition.  We attempted to extinguish each test after about 2 minutes by applying nitrogen.  However, the nitrogen only destabilized the flame without extinguishing it.  In order to extinguish the flame, the air flow was shut off and the flame rapidly went out.  Sample flame images are shown in fig. 1 (see BASS tab, linked below).  Digital still images from last week were received and are being analyzed.  Don was able to install another camera to obtain the bonus edge views which are very useful. The effect of flow speed is dramatic.  In future tests, we will attempt to get a flame at the smallest possible flow speed, and then determine how low the flow can get before the flame will go out.  This will verify the low-speed extinction limit as predicted by theory.  Finally, we estimated the mass loss rate from the images of the burned spheres.  The missing fuel amounts to 0.335 g in the approximate 100-second burn for an average burning rate of 3.35 mg/s.  The overall oxygen in the MSG (0.255 m3) should have dropped from 21% to 20.8%.  The total heat release was around 8.4 kJ, average heat release rate was 80W. (All assuming complete combustion.) BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.      [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.

CARD (Long Term Microgravity Model for Investigating Mechanisms of Heart Disease, ESA):     “André, since the CARD experiment was re-planned for you for the next coming week, please find some more background information on the CARD experiment below.”      [The CARD experiment studies how the cardiovascular system adapts to prolonged weightlessness, and in particular the underlying mechanisms of blood circulation in the peripheral parts of the human body (arm and legs) while a crewmember is in space.  During short duration space flight missions, the blood volume pumped by the heart (cardiac output) was increased by 22%, while the vascular resistance the heart has to overcome to pump blood through the vessels was decreased by 14%.  CARD investigates if these adaptations observed during short-duration missions, remain the same after three months in space.  The cardiac output is measured five times over a 24-hour period using the Pulmonary Function System (PFS).  Simultaneously blood pressure is monitored hourly by an automatic portable device.  The measurements are supported by a 24-hour urine collection and blood sampling towards the end of the measurement period to asses hormonal changes.] CARDIOCOG-2:   Complete.
