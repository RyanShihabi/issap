ISS On-Orbit Status 03/21/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – crew off-duty.  Ahead: Week 1 of Increment 23.     >>>Today 45 years ago (March 21, 1965), NASA launched Ranger 9, the last in the Ranger series.  The probe hit the Moon on March 24 in Crater Alphonsus, shooting & transmitting 5,814 photographs during the final 19 minutes of flight until impact.<<<  At wake-up, CDR Oleg Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-4 again inspected the filters before bedtime this morning, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]   After breakfast, FE-5 Noguchi supported the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]    Throughout the day, CDR Kotov supported the long test of the ASN-M Satellite Navigation System, started today by ground control centers for the next 2 days to determine the RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System) multipathing impacts of various SARJ/BGA/TRRJ (Solar Alpha Rotary Joint/Beta Gimbal Assembly/Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint) configurations, ahead of ATV-2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) later this year.      [The first test will run the RGPS with all SARJs & BGAs in Autotrack per nominal config.  For the second test, SARJs will be positioned at Zero and all BGAs edge-on to the RGPS receivers on the SM (Service Module).  After the second test, the BGAs will be run in Autotrack for a few orbits to recover energy balance and then will be repositioned biased slightly off of the edge-on positions to see if power generation can be improved without significantly increasing multipathing problems.  Throughout the test, to further reduce multipath, the TRRJs will be parked in a position slightly offset from parallel with the truss.  ISS appendages will be reconfigured back to nominal on 3/23 (Tuesday).  The second ATV is currently expected in December of this year.  The ATV-RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System) test is requiring some powerdowns in the USOS (US Segment) & RS (Russian Segment).]   Oleg completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].   The CDR also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.   An additional task for Kotov in the SM was the routine inspection of the SVO SRV-K2M (Condensate Water Processor) hoses from the MF-R Diaphragm Separator Filter to the BRPK Condensate Separation & Pumping Unit.   FE-6 Creamer worked on the US SLM (Sound Level Measurement) instrument, activating it for a checkout before tomorrow’s acoustic survey activities in the ISS modules.   Two new items on the US voluntary “job jar” task list for Timothy & Soichi for today were –  An inventory/audit of the installed seat cushion      and any spares for the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) to      clarify current stowage records, and Taking still & video photography from the      Cupola to help assess the visibility of the FGB nadir interface ring from      the Cupola windows.    [It is hoped that the Cupola RWS (Robotic      Workstation) will be installed by the time when STS-132 crewmembers will      use the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) to install the      Russian MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) at the FGB nadir port.  There is an      uncertainty in ground simulations whether the view of the docking      interface will be free or obstructed by a window cover.]     Jobs listed for Oleg for today on the Russian discretionary “as time permits” task list were –  A photography session for      the DZZ-13      “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining data on      oceanic water blooms, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, A session for Russia's EKON Environmental      Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of      environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera, and  ·         Taking video with the SONY HVR-Z7U camcorder of Lake Baikal, to be downlinked 3/24.     [Roskosmos TV studio is working on a feature on Lake Baikal and its importance as natural heritage, called ‘Planet Baikal’.  The feature will be broadcast in Vesti channel’s weekly program Kosmonavtika.  The Baikal Lake contains 20% of the world’s water reserves, it is a beautiful and a mysterious lake.  The producers want to highlight the grandeur of this natural gem and raise awareness about its pollution problems. The metaphor used throughout the feature is one of a planet, an element of the Universe and a cosmonaut talking about Baikal while on orbit is thought to be a perfect choice to convey it. The feature item will be filmed and broadcast to Earth in real time later (April 6-9).]   For ~1:30pm EDT, Soichi Noguchi had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) on his schedule, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).   The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).   No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
