Crew Off Duty: Today was a full off duty day for the USOS crew. This is to pay the crew back for performing Cygnus operations over the weekend.
Orbital 6 (OA-6) Capture and Berthing: Cygnus was successfully captured and berthed to the ISS on Saturday. The crew ingressed the vehicle on Sunday, spent 12.5 hours performing cargo transfer operations and cleared the entire corridor of the Cygnus vehicle. In addition, the following activities were completed:

Rodent Research 3 Eli Lilly (RR-3) Gather: Williams gathered and organized consumables needed for RR-3 operations which will occur in three blocks of time. Items were gathered to maximize efficiency for each of those time periods.
Habitability Human Factors Directed Observations: Kopra completed a session of the Habitability experiment, recording and submitting a walk-through video documenting observations of an area or activity providing insight related to human factors and habitability.
NanoRacks Platform-2 Modules Install: Williams installed Modules 16, 18, and 21 in NanoRacks Platform-2.  Module 16 is the parent for three sub-module experiments; Water Purification Through Reverse Osmosis, Protein Crystallization, and High Temperature Dispersion in Microgravity.  Module 18 is the parent for sub-module experiments Plant Inoculation Against Fungal Pathogens in Microgravity and Magnetic Field & Background Radiation Monitoring. Module 21 is the parent for three sub-experiments; Silver Crystal Growth, Memory Loss, Wisconsin Fast Plant Growth in a Vibration Environment.

Urine Processing Assembly (UPA): On Saturday, the UPA was taken to standby due to high P16 pressure,  indicating condensation in the bowl.  Later that day, after the system pumped down and dried out, a successful process cycle was completed.
On Board Training (OBT) Cygnus Rendezvous Debrief: Today the USOS crew participated in a debrief with ground teams to cover questions and comments related to Cygnus capture and berthing.
