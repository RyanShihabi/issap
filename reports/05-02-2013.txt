Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS) Experiment (BASS): Cassidy conducted the 7th of 13 sessions planned for this experiment. BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity and will guide strategies for extinguishing fires in microgravity. BASS results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth.
Binary Colloidal Alloy Test (BCAT)-3: On April 24, Sample 5 had a bubble that broke up into multiple small bubbles during homogenization which is undesirable since bubbles interfere with the phase separation process. This morning Hadfield remixed the sample and performed another run of Sample 5. The BCAT-C1 experiment studies nano-scale particles dispersed in liquid, known as a colloidal suspension, commonly found in such commercial commodities as paint, electronic polishing compounds and food products. These suspensions will have the unique property that the particles will phase separate (like oil and water) and the particles will self-assemble into crystals that interact strongly with light (like opal). Photographing these samples in microgravity allow the measurement of these processes while avoiding the effects of particle sinking due to gravity. This study will allow the development of new insights into this important material process.
Integrated Cardiovascular (ICV) Echo Ultrasound Scan: Marshburn set up the Ultrasound 2 hardware and configured it for ground viewing.  He then attached electrodes and the Electrocardiogram (ECG) cable to perform his final resting echo scan, with Cassidy as an operator and remote guidance from ground teams.  ICV aims to quantify the extent, time course and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy (decrease in the size of the heart muscle) associated with long-duration space flight, identify the mechanisms of this atrophy, and identify the functional consequences for crewmembers who spend extended periods of time in space.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) and Robotics Refueling Mission (RRM) Operations:  Today the Robotics Ground Controllers repowered the MSS video system and began Day 2 of the Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) Tertiary Task Ops. The Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator System (SPDM) was maneuvered in front of the RRM Forward face to perform the Sub Miniature Version A Adapter (SMA-A) and the Torque Set Adapter (TSA) tasks. The SMA-A attached to the Safety Cap Tool (SCT) and is currently positioned over SMA cap 5. This cap will be removed, followed by the removal of SMA cap 1. Once both caps have been removed, they and the SMA-A will be stowed into the Safety Cap Receptacle (SCR). The SCT will then be used to retrieve the Torque Set Adapter (TSA), which will be used to unfasten one caged screw and unfasten and refasten one uncaged screw. MSS System performance has been nominal.

Previous Status (05/01/13)
In-Flight Maintenance (IFM) improved Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway (iPEHG) Installation: Commander (CDR) Hadfield upgraded PEHG-2 (in LAB1D2) by removing the legacy PEHG and installing the new iPEHG. IPEGH-1 installation is scheduled for this Friday, May 3. The new iPEHG will have enhanced configuration capabilities over the existing PEHG, improved Gateway modes of operation and improved network protocols to support integration into Joint Station Joint Station LAN (JSL). Improvements include:
Current PEHG                          New iPEHG
Medium Rate Data Link              -10 Mbps                                  -100 Mbps
-20 channels per PEHG (w/        -23 channels per iPEHG (w/
Some unused)                          all accessible)
High Rate Data Link                   -10 Mbps                                  -100 Mbps
Environmental Health System (EHS) – Sound Level Meter (SLM) Setup and Operations: Hadfield conducted an acoustic survey using an SLM to measure the acoustic environment in the habitable areas of the ISS. He then transferred the data to a laptop for downlink for Ground analysis. The plan includes measurements in the Service Module (SM), Node 3 (N3), Mini Research Module (MRM)-1 and twelve sound measurements of Treadmill 2 (T2) operating at various speeds.  These measurements verify that the crew is not exposed to harmful levels.
SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device): Cassidy assembled and set up the hardware, then he, Hadfield, and Marshburn performed this activity in support of the Nutrition experiment. SLAMMD provides an accurate means of determining the mass of the crew in microgravity. The guiding principle of SLAMMD follows that of Newton’s Second Law of Motion, F=ma (i.e., force is equal to mass times acceleration).  For the Human Research Facility (HRF) SLAMMD, the force is generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD 4 Process Unit (PU) drawer. The acceleration used in calculating the mass is actually a calculated average acceleration with regression analysis. The acceleration is measured through the use of a precise optical instrument which detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing. The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.
European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) Belt Replace: Marshburn conducted an On-Board Training (OBT) review, prepared the Maintenance Work Area (MWA) and replaced belts on Rotors A and B. He also cleaned internal debris on both centrifuges.
Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE)-2 Vane Gap: Cassidy completed a procedures review and conducted a session of this experiment. Studies from CFE-2 may serve to demonstrate how liquids can be separated from gas in the absence of gravity. This is a key procedure for water purification systems in microgravity.
Periodic Drops on Joint Station Local Area Network (JSL) (Orbital Communications Adaptor (OCA): Since April 20, there have been periodic dropouts on the OCA network forward link that last from 10 seconds to 5 minutes. Yesterday, the crew reported that the frequency and duration of the dropouts had increased to the point that Internet Protocol (IP) Phone was no longer usable. The team performed several troubleshooting steps to try to resolve the dropouts. The United States Laboratory (USL) Edge Router was rebooted with no effect. The team then initiated a constant ping of the KU Communication Unit from the USL Edge Router and rebooted the KU Communication Unit network card. Since this time, no further dropouts have been seen and the crew was able to use IP Phone successfully overnight.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) and Robotics Refueling Mission (RRM) Operations:  Tuesday, the Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS and translated the Mobile Transporter (MT) from Worksite (WS) 4 to WS2. They then maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) into position and grappled the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator System (SPDM) and released it from Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF) 2. The Robotics Ground Controllers then maneuvered the SSRMS and SPDM to the start position for the RRM Tertiary Tasks Operations. Ground controllers also performed SPDM Diagnostics and Checkouts today in preparation for these operations.
Ground controllers tonight will be beginning the Day 1 of the RRM Tertiary Task Ops. They will maneuver the SSRMS into position and use the SPDM to unstow the Wire Cutting Tool (WCT) and the Safety Cap Tool (SCT) before reconfiguring the SSRMS to the forward face of the RRM to stow a safety cap, currently contained within the SCT, into the Safety Cap Receptacle (SCR). Once the safety cap is safely stowed, the SCT will then be used to retrieve the Sub Miniature Version A-Adapter (SMA-A) in preparation for the ops to take place on Day 2, scheduled for tomorrow.
