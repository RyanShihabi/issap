Soyuz Motion Control Test: Commander (CDR) Yurchikhin and Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Parmitano successfully conducted a Soyuz 35S Motion Control System Test. The test was performed in preparation for their upcoming undocking on Sunday, November 10th at 5:26pm (CST)
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Wireless Access Point (WAP) Installation: FE-3 Hopkins and FE-6 Nyberg completed installation of the JEM WAP in support of the Freezer-Refrigerator Of STirling cycle (FROST) payload activation.
US Segment Crew Handover: Nyberg and Parmitano conducted a handover with newly arrived crewmembers FE-8 Mastracchio and FE-9 Wakata. Topics included recommendations for on-orbit practices, lessons learned, and familiarization of ISS Systems and Payloads within each USOS module.
Biolab Microscope Cassette Installation: Biolab Microscope Cassette Installation: Parmitano installed the Microscope Cassette in the Biolab Microscope. This was in preparation for additional testing prior to Biolab commissioning planned for later this month. The Biolab is a multiuser research facility located in ESA’s Columbus laboratory, used to perform space biology experiments on microorganisms, cells, tissue cultures, small plants, and small invertebrates.  Biolab will allow scientists to gain a better understanding of the effects of microgravity and space radiation on biological organisms.
Environmental Health System (EHS) – Microbial Capture Device (MCD) and Coliform Water Sample Analysis: Hopkins visually analyzed coliform detection bags and microbial capture devices following 48 hours of incubation. This is regularly scheduled testing in order to characterize onboard water quality.
