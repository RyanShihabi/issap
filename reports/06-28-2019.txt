NRCSD (NanoRacks External Cygnus CubeSat Deployer): The crew reviewed procedures for the upcoming NRCSD-16 installation currently planned for next week. The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer is a stackable, modular, ground loaded launch case.  Each NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer accommodates up to eight launch cases. The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer meets the growing demand to deploy CubeSat format satellites from the ISS for a variety of customers.
RED-EYE Satellite: The RED-EYE program develops and demonstrates technologies which increase the utility of low-cost microsatellites. RED-EYE is a satellite designed for ISS deployment via the Kaber Micro Satellite Deployer using Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM). Following yesterday’s successful deployment of the RED-EYE satellite, today’s activities included JEM Airlock Slide Table extension and return of the Kaber Deployer into the JEM. Once inside ISS, the Kaber Deployer was removed from the Slide Table and stowed by the crew.
Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Jumper Installation: The crew completed Node 1 SSRMS jumper routing and installation activity. This jumper can be used in a contingency power loss scenario to regain power to the SSRMS and other external loads.
