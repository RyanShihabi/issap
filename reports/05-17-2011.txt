ISS On-Orbit Status 05/17/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. FE-3 Ron Garan is starting today on a special sleep-cycle schedule, the one the Shuttle crew is using:  Wake – 2:00am this morning (regular); Sleep – 2:26pm-10:56pm today, for supporting the ULF6 spacewalks support. With the RSK1 laptop connected, CDR Kondratyev & FE-5 Nespoli spent 2 hrs in their 25S Descent Module to conduct the Soyuz descent drill, a standard training exercise for every crew returning on this spacecraft.  Dmitri then disconnected the A31p RSK1 again.       [Results of the exercise, which strictly forbids any command activation (except for switching the InPU display on the Neptun-ME console), were subsequently reported to ground control at TsUP/Moscow.  Nespoli would be backup CDR for the Soyuz return flight, if necessary.  The session includes a review of the pertinent ODFs (operational data files), specifically the books on Soyuz Ascent & Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situations, crew responsibilities when executing the flight program, visual crew recognition of SUS (Entry Control System) failures, spacesuit procedures, etc., with special emphasis on operations with the Neptune-ME cockpit console.  The training uses a Descent Simulator application (Trenasher Spusk =”descent trainer”) on the RSK1 laptop.] Afterwards, Dima again had several hours set aside for packing & stowing cargo aboard Soyuz 25S (return cargo in Descent Module, disposable items in the Orbital Module). After wakeup, FE-1 Samokutyayev conducted the routine verification of yesterday’s automatic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.       [Regularly on Mondays, automatic virus definition file updates are verified on the RSS2, RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 network laptops, while the non-networked laptops RSE-Med & RSE1 are manually updated.  Antivirus scans are then started & monitored on RSS2 & RSE-Med.  Results of the scans on RSS1, RSK1-T61p, RSK2 & RSE1 are verified on Tuesdays.  Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Kondratyev, Garan, Nespoli & Coleman spent about an hour reviewing and discussing the tomorrow’s Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) photo shoot during which they will be using NIKON D2Xs digital still cameras with 800mm & 400mm lenses, joined by Dmitri with a 1000 mm lens.  Cady initiated charging of the D2Xs batteries.       [During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Discovery, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.] Activities completed by Cady Coleman during busy day included –Connecting the LTL (Low Temperature Loop) cooling to the Node-3 CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) for activation,Retrieving a T61p laptop USB 120 GB Hard Drive, an HDD (Hard Drive Disk) data cable and the SSC-20 (Station Support Computer 20) with power supply in the Lab and transferred all to Node-2 to be transferred to ULF by Mission Specialist Greg Chamitoff,Accessing & sampling ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) coolant fluid in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) at loc. F1 for return to the ground,Performing the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate water container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus), Collecting a WRM CWC (Water Recovery & Management / Contingency Water Container) condensate line sample from Node-3 WWB (Waste Water Bus),Working on the OpsLAN OSTPV (Operations Local Area Network / Onboard Short-Term Plan Viewer) display to update its MET (Mission Elapsed Time) with the Shuttle MET and build the ULF6 Shuttle preference file,Installing a temporary THC IMV (Temperature & Humidity Control / Intermodular Ventilation) air duct in Node-2 to optimize air mixing in the Lab for CO2 removal, with the Shuttle crew as additional station occupants on board,Switching on the ERB-2 (Erasmus Recording Binocular 2) at the ESA EDR (European  Drawer Rack and checking LED (Light-emitting Diode) status at EDR J4, then activating it and performing checks,Adjusting placement of MERLIN 2 (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker/Incubator 2) sensors 1 & 2 in ER6 (EXPRESS Rack 6) and reporting ID numbers of desiccant packs,Setting up the VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) on the FSL (Fluid Science Laboratory) seat track for monitoring her activity in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), then used a spare ITCS coolant sampling adapter, purged & filled, for retrieving a Return-to-Ground sample from the COL TCS (Thermal Control System) loop, andSupporting the JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), by putting ~100 ml of water in each of 2 drinking water containers from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser), followed by a joint review of the MYCO sampling procedures scheduled tomorrow morning, when she will distribute the containers to PLT Gregory Johnson & herself,  [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO body samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss]. In the MRM1 Rassvet module, FE-2 Borisenko conducted the periodic task of tightening the BZV quick release screw clamps of the SSVP docking mechanism on the MRM1/FGB StA docking interface. Aleksandr Samokutyayev transferred the Russian biotech payload BTKh-35/MEMBRANA to the MRM2 Poisk module.  Afterwards, FE-1 also set up and ran another session with the Russian BTKh-43 KONSTANTA (#2) biotech payload with Cassettes 1-6, supported by ground specialist tagup.      [BTKh-43, comprising the Recomb-K hybridizer bioreactor plus photo & video equipment with two SPR-1 portable lights, studies potential effects of spaceflight factors and their nature on the activity of a model enzyme relative to a specific substrate (bioreactors are specialized hardware for growing, cells, tissues, and microorganisms).] Sasha & Andrey again had ~1h20m set aside for performing a thorough inventory/audit of cargo stowage both in the FGB and SM.       [Guided by uplinked listings, the flight engineers updated the IMS (Inventory Management System), consolidated items in dedicated kits, pre-packed empty packs for disposal and took NIKON D2X photography of views for downlink via OCA.] Tasks performed by FE-3 Ron Garan, who has a shorter workday today (wake: 2:00am, sleep 2:26pm-10:56pm), included –Offloading the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly / Waste Water Tank) contents into a CWC-I (-Iodine) container from WWT process line B, then collecting a sample for return on ULF6 before tearing down the gear,·         Configuring THC IMV (Temperature & Humidity Control / Intermodular Ventilation) diffusers in the Lab, with the Shuttle crew as additional station occupants on board,Working in the Node-2 deck CQ (Crew Quarters) to connect ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) #15 and verify ATU speaker functionality, and·         Removing the panels at OA2 in the A/L (Airlock) as a get-ahead for the Shuttle-fed O2 setup for EVA campout/prebreathe on FD3. FE-5 Nespoli readied three BPSMUs (Battery Powered Speaker Microphone Units) for use by the Shuttle crew during the docked phase with the Orbiter.     [Using two A31p VSW (Video Streaming Workstations) laptops in the Node-2, one BPSMU was placed near the A/L, the other in the Node-3 near the Cupola hatch.  The third BPSMU is an auxiliary unit to be located inside the ODS (Orbiter Docking System) in case of an emergency egress.] Later, Paolo supported the ground in STS-134 preparations by pressurizing & leak-checking the PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 2) for ingress, hatch opening and stowage after the Shuttle’s arrival.      [PMA-2, at the ISS bow, will be the docking port for Endeavour tomorrow.  The VAJ/ISA (Vacuum Access Jumper / Internal Sampling Adapter) remains connected to MPEV (Manual Pressure Equalization Valve) for PMA-2 leak check after the docking.] FE-5 also unlocked the captive locks of the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezer. Samokutyayev used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 during a one-hour segment, taking pictures of targets along the flight track.      [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.  The FSS battery was set up for charging last night.] Sasha also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Andrey conducted a photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining data on oceanic color bloom patterns in the Central-Eastern Atlantic waters, then copied the images to the RSK-1 laptop.  Ron Garan & Paolo Nespoli worked an hour in the A/L preparing for the ULF6 EVAs (Extravehicular Activities).    [Activities involved setting up the E/L (Experiment Lock), configuring PHAs (Prebreathe Hose Assemblies), pre-gathering 2 CSA-O2 units ( Compound Specific Assembly-Oxygen, #1045, #1046), a vacuum manometer, and verifying readiness of emergency equipment,- 1 PFE (Portable Fire Extinguisher),  8 PBA QDMs (Portable Breathing Apparatus / Quick-Don Mask Assembly), O2 bottles.]  Paolo & Ron also had ~30 min to review STS/ISS hatch opening procedures as a refresher. CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-5 & FE-6 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) scheduled, via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Ron at ~8:36am, Paolo at ~11:01am, Cady at ~12:26pm, Dmitri at ~1:26pm, Sasha at ~1:46pm EDT. At ~10:06am, Sasha & Andrey supported as Russian PAO TV downlink, extending greetings & well-wishes on the occasion of the re-opening of the Moscow Planetarium on 6/12 after 17-year long renovation.     [Natalia Vitalyevna Artyukhina, executive director of the Planetarium Joint Stock Company, and Oxana Andreyevna Maltseva, Planetarium Art Director, were present TsUP/Moscow during the comm session.] At ~2:06pm, FE-2 Borisenko had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). At ~3:31pm, Nespoli & Coleman are scheduled for a tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Andorra la Vella, Andorra (the capital of the tiny Co-principality of Andorra with a population of about 23,000 is situated in a small, high mountain valley of eastern Pyrenees Mountains between France and Spain.  ISS pass was in mid-morning light with fair weather expected.  Looking carefully for this small target just right of track as ISS passed northeastward over the Pyrenees), Mississippi Delta Region (the crew had two opportunities today to acquire imagery of the dramatic flooding event that has now shifted to the lower Mississippi River Valley.  This target area is typically a routine science target that monitors land-use patterns and changes in the large, complex Mississippi delta system.  For the first pass the area of primary interest was in the western third of the area well left of track for this early-morning, fair-weather pass.  Because light will be low, recommended was no more than a 180mm lens setting.  As ISS tracked northeastward over the north-central Gulf of Mexico, the crew should have spotted the Louisiana coast and the “birds-foot” delta of the Mississippi, then aiming well left of track for the controlled flooding that is progressing rapidly in the Atchafalaya River basin.  This levee-lined wilderness and wetland area has been maintained to receive emergency releases of excessive flow in the Mississippi River in order to relieve pressure on the protective levees of the major cities and industries located downstream [primarily Baton Rouge and New Orleans].  Flood control structures were opened this past Saturday morning and the basin is now being inundated.  Trying for a mapping strip of the broad flow of muddy water through the basin), Chiricahua Mountains (the pass today for this target was in early morning light with fair weather over most of the region.  As ISS tracked northeastward over northwestern Mexico into southeastern Arizona, the crew was to look carefully nadir for this area.  This small, fist-shaped range of mountains is situated in the southeastern corner of the state of Arizona, USA about 90 miles east-southeast of Tucson.  With elevations ranging from about 4,000 to 9,800 feet, the Huachuca support an ecologically diverse, alpine-woodland habitat within the Sonoran Desert that includes them in the regional province of scattered highlands known as the Madrean Sky Islands of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States.  CEO researchers are seeking detailed mapping views of this target for baseline and change detection of unique and threatened habitat), West Hawk Impact Crater, Manitoba (ISS had clear weather for this late-morning, nadir pass over this target.  Approach was from the WSW.  This impact is marked by a ragged, circular lake about 40 miles north of the northwest edge of Lake of The Woods.  CEO observers are seeking details with the long lens settings.  Before reaching this target the crew may first have spotted the city of Winnipeg left of track and the large Lake of The Woods right of track.  Looking nadir for overlapping views of impact area), and Mississippi River Flooding (DYNAMIC EVENT TARGET:  The second, fair-weather pass today for the ongoing Mississippi River Flooding event described earlier.  Unlike the first pass this one was in much better, mid-afternoon lighting conditions.  As ISS tracked over the lower Mississippi River Valley, the crew was to use the 400mm lens to locate and acquire mapped imagery of the flood area.)
