ISS On-Orbit Status 10/05/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Yuri also completed the daily reboot of the Russian RSS1 & RSS2 laptops. With STTS communications configured for work in MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2), Malenchenko conducted an active session for the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), followed by downlinking the video footage obtained with a SONY HVR-Z1J camcorder via RSPI (Data Transmission Radio Link).       [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS: condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.] Other activities completed by Yuri were –The regular monthly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation & Stabilization);   [this requires inspecting the condition of harnesses, belt slats, corner bracket ropes, SLD (Subject Load Device) cables & exit pulley housing, IRBAs (Isolation Restorative Bungee Assemblies) and gyroscope wire ropes for any damage or defects, lubricating as required plus recording control panel time & date values, and making sure that the display cable and skirt were properly secured afterwards],Continuing the ongoing cargo transfers to the Progress M-16M/48P ship for stowage (i.e., not for disposal);   [since 48P is scheduled to remain docked to the station until February next year, it serves as a temporary stowage location for selected cargo items, all of which must be documented in the IMS (Inventory Management System) database],Servicing the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), taking readings of the eight radiation detectors, then re-initializing and replacing the dosimeters in the RS.  The completed registration document was loaded on the RSS2 laptop for transmittal to TsUP-Moscow through the high-speed RSPI Data Transmission Radio Link;   [a total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (dosimeters (A41, A42, A43, A44, A45, A46, A47, A48) are deployed in the RS.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies],Continuing the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, today working in the MRM2 Poisk, cleaning the V3 fan, and in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoj Blok) where FE-4 cleaned filter & fan grille of the TsV1 central circulation ventilator using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush,Completing the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM;   [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator], andTaking care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).  Aki Hoshide broke out and set up the ESA ENERGY experiment for operation, first configuring the Armband monitor using the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop, then preparing the PFS (Pulmonary Function System) for ENERGY and collecting tap water samples from the Lab PWD (Potable Water Dispenser).      [After setup, the Armband monitor is positioned on the right triceps. It will start automatically. The instrument must be worn for the entire 10-day ENERGY measurement period and removed only during showers or if needed during blood draws. Activities without the Armband monitor on the triceps should be carefully logged. The switch-on and switch-off of the Armband monitor is automatic with skin contact. The Armband monitor will be removed at the end of the 10-day period, then data will be downloaded from the device. Water samples are stowed ambient in the Energy Sample Kit (same as for the urine samples).   Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] At about 6:30am EDT, Akihiko concluded his 3rd (FD75) session of the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~6:30am), then powered on the laptop and downloaded the data from the two Actiwatch Spectrums, copied the data from the 2 HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC and downloaded Cardiopres data.         [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] CDR Williams successfully performed the ER2 RIC (EXPRESS Rack 2 Rack Interface Controller) software upgrade.       [Due to problems Sunita had with a PCMCIA (Portable Computer Memory Card International Adapter) Harness memory card on 10/1 while trying to use the ER2 T61p laptop for the RIC loading with software Release 8.3, Suni today performed troubleshooting on the card and tried the ER1 T61p laptop to connect the PCMCIA card for loading the ER2 software.  Communication could not be established, so the CDR reverted back to the alternate method of uploading the software (single-port load).  The remainder of the RIC upgrade & configuration is being completed via ground commanding.  The purpose of the update is to upgrade the RIC software to version 8.3 to support DTN (Delay Tolerant Networking) for ESA experiments and to load software that will allow future software updates to be performed by ground commanding.]  Later in the day, Williams booted the DTN laptop from the currently installed DVD. With the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) activated, the CDR powered on the InSPACE and InSPACE3 (Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Emulsions 3) hardware and conducted several runs of the experiment.       [Steps included turning on MSG video cameras & monitor, verifying optical alignment of the cameras, and configuring the MSG video recorders.  Then, after switching the magnetic field to STEADY mode, Sunita swept & focused the field of view, later removed & stowed the video tapes from the MSG video recorders and inserted new blank tapes for another run.  After the last run of the day, the hardware and video drawers were deactivated.] At ~4:05am EDT, Yuri, Suni & Aki held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Main Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~4:25am, CDR Williams powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 11:00am conducted a ham radio session with students at Izmir SEV Primary School, Turkey. At ~2:45pm, the crewmembers held their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston. Before Presleep (~3:30pm), Suni powered up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and started the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turned MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.] Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) to practice recording target positions on the surface of the Earth, andA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.
