ISS On-Orbit Status 01/01/11 Happy New Year! All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Off-duty day for the Expedition 26/27 crew of CDR Scott Kelly, FE-1 Alexander Kaleri, FE-2 Oleg Skripochka, FE-4 Dmitri Kondratyev, F-5 Paolo Nespoli & FE-6 Catherine Coleman (who experienced 16 New Year’s Eve events – but officially celebrated only 3: on Houston, TX time,  on GMT & on TsUP-Moscow time.)  FE-2 Oleg Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] CDR Kelly performed another status check on the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) Galley fridge, looking for any internal condensation moisture which would require replacing desiccants.     [MERLIN, the Galley fridge, is used for cold storage of crew food and drink.  If Scott found moisture, a change-out of the desiccant will be scheduled.  Daily checks by the crew are currently required because the ground has lost insight into MERLIN due to issues with the failed ER6 (EXPRESS Rack 6) laptop software load on 12/28.  A manual software load by a crewmember will be scheduled for 1/3.  FDS (Fire Detection & Suppression) capabilities for the rack are still in place.] As part of the crew’s regular morning inspection tour, Skripochka & Kondratyev conducted the routine checkup of circuit breakers & fuses in the DC-1 Docking Module.     [The monthly checkup in the DC-1 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 & BPP-36. MRM2 “Poisk” & MRM1 “Rassvet” modules are also being inspected regularly since they are very similar to DC-1.] Alex completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.] FE-5 & FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Cady at ~9:20am, Paolo at ~11:35am EST. The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).
