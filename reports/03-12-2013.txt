New Status:
Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) Maintenance:  After 24 hrs of successful run time, the Lab CDRA fixed yesterday has been put in stand-by mode.
Biological Research In Canisters-17: Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Marshburn unpacked and performed actuation of 2 BRIC canisters.  BRIC supports a variety of plant growth investigations which focus on the growth and development of cell cultures in microgravity. Specimens are preserved with a chemical fixative and returned to the ground for post-flight evaluation.
Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Vertigo Experiment: Ford set up the Vertigo Goggles, loaded the SPHERES and Goggles with test session specific programs and executed a session of the experiment. He then downloaded the data and shut down the Goggles. The experiment investigates the ability to create a three-dimensional model of an unknown object in space using only one or two small satellites. The experiment uses passive, visual cameras as the primary sensors to construct the model. These cameras have the advantage of being small and lightweight, as compared to current systems which rely on heavy and power-hungry laser or radio frequency (RF) systems.
CRew User Interface System Enhancement (CRUISE): Hadfield performed a Procedural Display (PD) and Voice Activated Procedure Viewer session using the CRUISE laptop.  This is a technology/crew operations demonstration experiment for voice guided procedure execution in International Procedure Viewer (IPV) and procedural display.
Coarsening in Solid Liquid Mixture 3 (CSLM-3) Experiment: Hadfield is periodically cycling the Sample Processing Unit (SPU) water valve in preparation for tomorrow’s 3rd of 6 CSLM-3 runs. These samples will be returned to the ground on SpX-2.  CSLM-3 is a materials science investigation that studies the growth and solidification processes (i.e., coarsening) in lead-tin solid-liquid mixtures that contain a small amount of tin branch-like (dendrite) structures, some of which possess many arms. During sample heating, the growth at the tip of each dendrite continues over time, whereas side branches, behind the tip, develop during constant temperature conditions. By understanding how temperature and time control the growth of such dendrites, researchers hope to develop more efficient and economical means of producing higher quality products derived from the casting of molten metals.
SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device): Hadfield and Marshburn performed this activity in support of the Nutrition experiment. SLAMMD provides an accurate means of determining the mass of the crew in microgravity. The guiding principle of SLAMMD follows that of Newton’s Second Law of Motion, F=ma (i.e., force is equal to mass times acceleration).  For the Human Research Facility (HRF) SLAMMD, the force is generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD 4 Process Unit (PU) drawer. The acceleration used in calculating the mass is actually a calculated average acceleration with regression analysis. The acceleration is measured through the use of a precise optical instrument which detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing. The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.

Previous Status (3/11/13)
Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) Maintenance: Over the weekend, Commander (CDR) Ford and Flight Engineer (FE) – 6 Marshburn completed maintenance on the Node 3 (N3) CDRA and reinstalled it in the Atmosphere Revitalization 2 (AR2) rack in N3.  N3 CDRA was activated on Saturday and has accumulated over 36 hrs of operation using the new Desiccant/Sorbet beds delivered on SpaceX-2.  This morning Marshburn replaced a degraded Desiccant / Sorbent bed in the Lab CDRA with the healthier of the 2 beds removed from N3 CDRA last week. Currently both the Lab and the N3 CDRA are running as checkouts continue.  The bed removed from the N3 CDRA and the one removed today from the Lab CDRA will be returned to the ground on SpaceX-2 (SpX-2) for refurbishment.
SpX-2 Cargo Operations:  FE-5 Hadfield completed all currently available packing of hardware for return on SpX-2 over the weekend.  Not all of the hardware is ready for packing, as it includes experiment hardware which is currently in use.  SpX-2 cargo return operations are ahead of schedule.
Human Research Facility (HRF) Sample Blood Draw:  Ford completed his final blood draw before return to earth. He configured and spun the blood samples in the Vascular Refrigerated Centrifuge, then inserted the samples in the Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) for return and analysis.
Soyuz (Sz) 32 (32S) Preparations for Return: Today a 32S thruster test was successfully completed. Crewmembers CDR Ford, FE-1 Novitskiv, and FE-2 Tarelkin are returning on 32S, and over the weekend packed return cargo for their Soyuz vehicle.   The 32S crew also practiced a nominal Soyuz descent On-Board Training (OBT) session.  32S is planned to undock on Thursday 3/14/13 at 7:30 PM CDT, with landing scheduled for 10:57 pm CDT. 33 Soyuz crewmembers, Romanenko, Hadfield and Marshburn, completed a post-32S undock emergency roles and responsibilities review.
Coarsening in Solid Liquid Mixture 3 (CSLM-3) Experiment:  Hadfield completed another CSLM sample run, changed out the Sample Processing Units (SPUs), and initiated the next run. This completes the 2nd of 6 runs planned during the SpX-2 docked mission, after which the samples will be returned to the ground.  CSLM-3 is a materials science investigation that studies the growth and solidification processes (i.e., coarsening) in lead-tin solid-liquid mixtures that contain a small amount of tin branch-like (dendrite) structures, some of which possess many arms. During sample heating, the growth at the tip of each dendrite continues over time, whereas side branches, behind the tip, develop during constant temperature conditions. By understanding how temperature and time control the growth of such dendrites, researchers hope to develop more efficient and economical means of producing higher quality products derived from the casting of molten metals.
Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Vertigo Experiment: Ford reviewed procedures and uploaded files in preparation for tomorrow’s planned run of this experiment. The experiment investigates the ability to create a three-dimensional model of an unknown object in space using only one or two small satellites. The experiment uses passive, visual cameras as the primary sensors to construct the model. These cameras have the advantage of being small and lightweight, as compared to current systems which rely on heavy and power-hungry laser or radio frequency (RF) systems.

Biological Research In Canisters-17: Marshburn unpacked and performed actuation of 2 BRIC canisters.  BRIC supports a variety of plant growth investigations which focus on the growth and development of cell cultures in microgravity. Specimens are preserved with a chemical fixative and returned to the ground for post-flight evaluation.
Microflow Experiment:  Hadfield completed the 2nd of 2 planned sessions of this experiment by removing a sample cartridge from cold stowage, installing it in the cytometer and processing the 6 samples in the cartridge.  He then downlinked the data and disposed of the samples. The Microflow 1 technology demonstration provides the first performance test of a miniaturized flow cytometer in the microgravity environment of the ISS. Flow cytometry is a technique that focuses fluids (blood or other body fluids) into a controlled stream that enables researchers to quantify the components and monitor physiological and cellular activity. The goal of this testing in microgravity is the development of a smaller and safer operational instrument that may be certified for real-time medical care and monitoring during space flight.
