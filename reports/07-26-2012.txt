ISS On-Orbit Status 07/26/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      At wakeup, Sergei Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Upon wakeup, FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Williams & FE-6 Hoshide completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 24th for Joe, the 3rd for Suni & Aki.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] CDR Padalka worked on the ZVB quick-release screw clamps on the SSVP docking mechanism of ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3). FE-6 Hoshide had Day 5 of his first (FD15) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  In addition to closing out the associated 24-hr urine sample collections, Akihiko also underwent the generic blood draw by self-phlebotomy, photo-documented by Joe Acaba, then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the JPM MELFI (JEM Pressurized Module Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Later, Aki also stowed the equipment used for the urine and blood collections.     [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.  For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15th day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 & 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] FE-5 Williams set up the USND (Ultrasound) with video camcorder and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), placed reference markers on the thigh and calf of her right leg and donned the SPRINT thigh and calf guides and then, with the help of Joe Acaba, performed a SPRINT leg scan with remote guidance from ground teams, her first.        [SPRINT (Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study) evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise training to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in ISS crewmembers during long-duration missions.] Using the audio S/G1 (Space-to-Ground 1) connection, Padalka, Sergey and Malenchenko conducted a PEC (Private Exercise Conference) with exercise specialists. With its battery freshly charged overnight, Gennady Padalka set up the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment, installed yesterday at SM window #9, then used it to take spectral and photographic imagery of Earth’s surface and atmosphere under ground commanding.  Later, the CDR dismantled the equipment for stowage and dumped the data from Laptop 3 via the RSS1 terminal.        [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] FE-2 Revin performed the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] In the MRM1 Rassvet module, FE-2 serviced the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), verifying proper function of the deployed radiation detectors by taking readings and checking date/time from the LULIN-5 electronics box located near the spherical “phantom”, then replacing the dosimeters.  The completed registration document was loaded on the RSS2 laptop for transmittal through the high-speed RSPI Data Transmission Radio Link or transferred to Earth through OCA.      [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (dosimeters (A41, A42, A43, A44, A45, A46, A47, A48) are deployed in the RS.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.] Sergei also collected & downloaded the periodic sensor readings of the Russian “Pille-MKS” (MKS = ISS) radiation dosimetry experiment which has 11 sensors placed at various locations in the RS (DC1, SM starboard & port cabin windows, ASU toilet facility, control panel, MRM2, MRM1, etc.) and four in CQs.     [The memory/flash card was then replaced.  Today’s readings were taken manually from all 11 deployed dosimeters and logged on a data sheet.  The dosimeters take their readings automatically every 90 minutes.] In preparation of HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3) berthing on 7/27 (Thursday), FE-3 Joe Acaba –Enabled power to the UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) of the Cupola RWS DCP (Robotic Workstation Display & Control Panel),Connected the Lab RWS DCP bypass cable, enabling DCP power,Installed & checked out the CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System at the Node-2 nadir port, andPrepared external ISS truss camera viewing by calibrating the screen overlay for the P1LOOB (Port 1 Lower Outboard), P1LOIB (Port 1 Lower Inboard & S1LOOB (Starboard 1 Lower Outboard) TV cameras from the Cupola RWS.  Afterwards, Acaba, Williams & Hoshide each had a one-hour block of time reserved for a POC DOUG (Portable Onboard Computers / Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) review of the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) operations they will be conducting during HTV3 capture & berthing ULF5.  FE-5 completed Part 3 of the periodic acoustic measurement protocol, collecting the acoustic crew-worn dosimeters the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) from the RS (Russian Segment) crew, i.e., Gennady, Sergei & Yuri, and then downloading their recorded data. Malenchenko took diagnostic photography of the SBMP (valve adapter) of the Elektron oxygen generator assembly. Yuri also conducted another 2h session with the KPT-2 payload suite of BAR science instruments, with Piren-V and TTM-2, conducting air temperature and humidity monitoring in the RS (Russian Segment) to fill the mapped database to populate the mapped RS data base.       [KPT-2 monitors problem areas, necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data are copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities are supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer / thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] Joe Acaba had another ~45m min for performing the continuing preventive inspection & cleaning of accessible AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) system bacteria filters in Node-1, Node-2 & Node-3.     [Today photo documentation was required, with location labels added before picture-taking to facilitate filter door identification by ground personnel.] In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Acaba supported JAXA/Tanegashima with another self-check of the HCP (HTV Control Panel) for the HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3) arrival by testing the function of all LED (light-emitting diode) lights and panel backlight, then turning the HCP off.  At ~12:30pm EDT, Hoshide concluded his first (FD15) ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~11:10am), then powered on the laptop and downloaded the data from the two Actiwatch Spectrums, copied the data from the 2 HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC and downloaded Cardiopres data.         [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] In preparation for the arrival of the HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3), Sunita Williams pre-gathered equipment from the VOK (Vestibule Outfitting Kit) required for post-berthing vestibule outfitting and other HTV33HTV operations.     [The VOK was retrieved from behind a Node-2 panel at O4-O1.] Afterwards, Suni closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows. The CDR performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-2 Revin took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Maintenance System) servicing, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). The six crewmembers joined for undertaking a 45-min refresher OBT (On Board Training) ISS simulator emergency drill, practicing initial crew actions in response to specific emergency cases, followed by a 15-min tagup with ground specialists. Yuri & Aki had another hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. Suni & Joe had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Before Presleep, FE-3 turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~2:50pm, the crew will hold their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston. Before exercising on the ARED advanced resistive device, Malenchenko set up and checked out the G1 video camera for it to record his, Sergei’s & Joe’s workout session on the machine, meeting the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.  Afterwards, the video footage was stowed by Sergei. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).  Tasks listed for Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). Progress 47P Redocking Update:   After the redocking abort on 7/23, the question of when to redock was discussed at length, leading to the decision not to do it on 7/27 following HTV3 berthing, but on 7/28 (Saturday) at 9:00pm EDT.  Abort cases for both HTV3 and Progress have been addressed and reviewed to ensure reduced risk to all three vehicles.   The USOS (US Orbital Segment) crew is not planning on sleep shifting for the docking attempt, though the ground expects that if the crew wakes up to view docking, they can sleep in the following day.  Since the day after docking is Sunday, there is no impact to the crew wake up time. CEO targets uplinked for today were Amman, Jordan (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  ISS had a fine fair-weather pass today for this target in mid-morning light.  The Jordanian capital city of over 2 million is located in a hilly area of the northwestern part of the country about 25 miles northeast of the Dead Sea.  At this time as ISS approached from the NW, the crew was to look just right of track for this sprawling, but low-contrast urban area and acquire it within a single frame), Wells Creek Impact Crater, TN (ISS had a near nadir pass over this challenging impact crater in Tennessee.  The crater is 12 km in diameter and is estimated to be about 200 million years old.  The Expedition 28 crew was able to capture this crater in a context view just over a year ago.  CEO staff requested overlapping context views with a longer lens), Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (LONG TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH [LTER] SITE:  This study area is a barrier island and marsh complex located on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island and the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the United States.  ISS had a mid-morning pass in fair weather.  At this time as ISS tracked southeastward toward the Atlantic coast, the crew was to look towards nadir and shoot a mapping strip from Brunswick to Savannah), Andrews Forest, Oregon (LONG TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARSH SITE:  ISS had an early morning pass in fair weather for this target area with approach from the NW.  This study area is located on the lower, western slopes of the Cascade Range and just east of the agricultural region of the Willamette River valley NE of Eugene, Oregon.  At this time as ISS crossed the coast, the crew was to look for the interior river valley and try for a nadir mapping strip just left of track), San Salvador, El Salvador (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  ISS had a mid-morning pass over the capital city of El Salvador with a fair-weather approach from the NW.  The sprawling urban area of the city of over 2 million lies in an interior mountain valley surrounded by volcanoes and is prone to earthquakes.  At this time as ISS tracked over interior Central America, the crew was to look just right of track for this city just west of Lake Ilopango), and Quito, Ecuador (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  ISS had a late-morning pass in fair weather for this target with approach from the NW.  The capital of Ecuador with a population of 2.25 million is located in the northern part of the country at an elevation of 9,350 feet making it the highest capital city in the world.  At this time the crew was to look towards nadir to spot this N-S oriented urban area within an interior mountain valley just west of Pichincha Volcano).
