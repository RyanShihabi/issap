USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #51: Today Ricky Arnold (EV-1) and Drew Feustel (EV-2) completed US EVA #51 Node 2 (N2) Forward External Wireless Communications (EWC) with a Phased Elapsed Time (PET) of 6h 49m. Today’s EVA tasks included:

Routing EWC power and Ethernet cables between the US Lab and N2.
Installing Worksite Interface (WIF) #16 and WIF #17 Booms and mating associated HD Camera and EWC connections.
R&R Camera Port (CP)3 External High Definition Camera (EHDC) and Luminaire.
Closing the Cloud Aerosol Transport System (CATS) Aperture Door.

The crew was also able to complete the Articulating Portable Foot Restraint (APFR) Relocate, Solar Array Blanket Boxes (SABB) Base Joint Tie Back, and Adjustable Grapple Bar (AGB) Relocate from External Stowage Platform (ESP)2 to Express Logistics Carrier (ELC)4 Get-Ahead tasks. Ground Controllers performed a Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF) Local Bus (LB) channel swap during the EVA to ensure that the data cables were install properly. They also completed functional checkouts of the new EWC HD Cameras and the CP3 EHDC and Luminaire.
