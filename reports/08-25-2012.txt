ISS On-Orbit Status 08/25/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off duty After wakeup and breakfast, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Upon wakeup, FE-5 Sunita Williams & FE-6 Akihiko Hoshide completed their post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, currently performed daily, the 16th for the two of them.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] FE-4 Malenchenko concluded his first session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2-2 protocol which monitors human cardiovascular performance in the space flight environment.       [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Yuri doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] Padalka, Revin, Acaba, Malenchenko, Williams & Hoshide joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including all USOS (US Orbit Segment) modules like Lab, Nodes, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Sergei, Yuri & Gennady also completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), and the grilles of the SKV air conditioner in the SM. FE-2 Revin serviced the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, extracting the top of the bioreactor (#6) from the TBU-V incubator (+29 degC), shaking it with “moderately strong” movements for 2 minutes without taking it out of the case and inserting it again in TBU-V.      [Started on 8/23, this activity is being carried out for 21 days, once in the morning and once in the evening.] Joe performed regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. At ~8:00am EDT, Sunita Williams activated the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) routing to downlink the recording of Joe’s Treadmill Kinematics session of yesterday and her Kinematics session on 8/23, stopping it at ~12:05pm.       [POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center/Huntsville) routed the on-board HRDL (High-Rate Data Line) system.] FE-6 Hoshide & FE-5 Williams filled out their standard FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop).  It was Aki’s and Suni’s 5th.        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Working in Node-3 on the WRS (Water Recovery System), Acaba reconfigured the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) by disconnecting the QD (quick disconnect) depress hose along with the tank’s vent adapter for nominal UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) operations. Suni & Joe had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.  Today, Suni was to fill out her mid-increment questionnaire instead of the normal Journal activity.] FE-5 & FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) scheduled, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Suni at ~2:25pm, Akihiko at ~4:10pm EDT. At ~9:25am, the entire crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-4).      [FE-6 & FE-5 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Today, Suni had no exercise tomorrow.  Her protocol shows ARED (resistive)/T2 (aerobic continuous) for today, and T2 (2 min, interval), ARED/CEVIS (aerobic, cont.), T2 (30sec, int.), ARED (video)/CEVIS, EVA-18, and T2 (4 min, int.) for the next 6 days.  Aki’s protocol shows T2 (2 min, int.) for today, with ARED/CEVIS, T2 (30sec/int), ARED/CEVIS, T2 (4 min, int.), and EVA-18 on the following 5 days.] Tasks listed for the USOS crew of Acaba, Williams & Hoshide on their voluntary/discretionary “job jar” list were –·        Review WAP (Wireless Access Point) deploy options and report crew preference,·        File JAXA Report 9,·        Install ODK Diagnostic Kit EEG SD card to allow data recovery on the MDLT (Medical Laptop) by the ground,·        Set up a blue stowage rack in JPM (JEM Pressurized Module),·        Gather trash ad load into ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3),·        Reconfigure IMV (Intermodular Ventilation) in PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module),·        Perform inventory & consolidation  on JAXA JPM EPS2 Rack stowage,·        Record & downlink crew choice video for KSC Visitors Center, and·        Relocate food warmer into Node-1.Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,·        A detailed & general view photo session of the flooding which occurred overnight on 8/21-22 at the Black Sea;   [the disaster zone includes the towns Novomikhalovsky, Lermontovo and Tenginka, the Shapsukho & Nechepsukho river valleys and the adjacent mountain region.  Novomikhalovsky is located on the Tuapse-Novorossiisk Highway, 33 km from Tuapse and 14 km from Dzubgi. The town is situated in the Nechepsukho river valley and its tributary Psebe, where Nechepsukho is falling into Mikhalovsky Bay in the Black Sea. As a result of torrential rain the Nechepsukho River flooded.  600 houses, a hospital and a school were in the disaster zone. Four people died, 1500 were affected, including 275 children.  Municipal infrastructures need to be restored. Lermontovo is located on the shores of Tenginsky Bay of the Black Sea, at the inflow of Shapsukho River. The valley of that river is approx. 40 km in length, 5 km to the east of Dzubgi on the Tuapse-Novorosskiisk highway and 55 km from Tuapse. The Tenginka village is located 4 km upriver], and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (32-0027G) lists 12 CWCs (241.6 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (5 CWCs with 192 5 L);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (2 CWCs with 35.1 L); and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L, stowed in ATV3 for disposal.  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
