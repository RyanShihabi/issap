Radi-N2 Retrieve: The crew retrieved the eight Radi-N2 bubble detectors from their deployed location near windows 3 and 4 in the Cupola, and handed over the Russian crew for processing.  The detectors had been deployed in this location for one week.  The objective of this Canadian Space Agency investigation is to better characterize the ISS neutron environment, define the risk posed to the crew members’ health, and provide the data necessary to develop advanced protective measures for future spaceflight.  It’s been recognized that neutrons make up a significant fraction (10-30%) of the biologically effective radiation exposure in low-Earth orbit.  The bubble detectors used in the investigation are designed to detect neutrons and ignore all other radiation.

ISS Leak Detection Operations: Yesterday, following the conclusion of the weekend leak isolation test, ground teams began to observe an increase of the ISS leak rate. The unexpected increase in the leak rate led the on-console team to wake the crew to take action. The crew ran a modified emergency response procedure which highly suggested the leak location was in the vicinity of the Service Module. Once the suspected volumes were identified, the crew stepped into some initial actions to try and locate the leak. While the leak rate was initially observed to increase over about a 13 hour period, the rate leveled out to previous values early this morning. The teams continue to work a forward plan and all the data collected overnight is being reviewed.
