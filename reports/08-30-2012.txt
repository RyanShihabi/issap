08-30-2012August 30, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 08/30/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. EVA-18 by FE-5 Sunita Williams & FE-6 Akihiko Hoshide began at 8:16am EDT and ended after 8hr 17min, without completing all objectives. Supported by FE-3 Joe Acaba as IV (intravehicular crewmember) plus FE-4 Yuri Malenchenko & Acaba on the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) during the spacewalk, Williams (EV1) & Hoshide (EV2) –·        Connected & routed one of two power cables (#413) between the FGB & US Segment for the yet-to-arrive Russian MLM (Multipurpose Laboratory Module); jumper #651 was not connected;    [future Russian EVA will complete the cable layouts and provide US power to MLM & SM via all 4 MBSUs [Main Bus Switching Units], instead of current configuration where only two are used to power SM],·        Removed the failed MBSU1 but were unable to install the spare MBSU when the H2 bolt could not be driven in several attempts using the PGT (Pistol Grip Tool) with and without its Torque Multiplier;  [ground teams are discussing future troubleshooting steps],·        Installed the failed MBSU1 in the stbd ESP-1 FSE (External Stowage Platform 1 Flight Support Equipment),·        Reconfigured EVA tools (WIF/Worksite Interface Fixture Extender) (get-ahead), andCleaned up/Ingressed.[Instead of going through the usual overnight Campout procedure, EV1 & EV2 used the new ISLE (In-Suit Light Exercise) protocol for denitrogenation, designed to create efficiency in spacewalk preparation and tested by Fincke & Feustel on ULF6/EVA-3.  For ISLE, Suni & Aki performed light exercise for 100 minutes, starting at ~3:15am EDT while partially suited, using masks to breathe pure O2 (oxygen) to facilitate purging of N2 (nitrogen) from blood stream and tissues.  This eliminates the need for campout.  Afterwards, the EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units) were purged, continuing with more ISLE with in-suit prebreathe while collecting data and swapping METOX (Metal Oxide) canisters for CO2 absorption.  Depressurization of the A/L C-LK (Airlock Crewlock) followed at ~7:40am for about 30 min.  With EV1 & EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-18 began at 8:16am.  It ended at 4:33pm, lasting 8h 17 min.  It was the 164th spacewalk for ISS assembly & maintenance, the 3rd this year, and the 353rd worldwide, i.e., for all Astronauts & Cosmonauts, since 1965.] Before the EVA, FE-3 Acaba –Set up the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) and DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) peripherals with the SSC-8 (Station Support Computer 8) T61p laptop, to support SSRMS ops,Set up an SSC in the Lab for additional monitoring,Performed functional testing on the two EVA cameras, andConfigured the ACS (Atmosphere Control & Supply) high-pressure O2 tank bypass to use O2 from the low-pressure tank. FE-3 Acaba supported the spacewalkers on their ISLE protocol, ISLE prebreathe & EMU preps, operated the SSRMS, assisted by FE-4 Malenchenko, to “fly” Aki Hoshide for worksite translations with the MBSUs, and supported Suni & Aki during post-EVA activities. Malenchenko configured the internal RS (Russian Segment) STTS communications connections, setting up the IAS (Internal Audio Subsystem) to work with USOS (US Segment) comm in support of the EVA. Before starting her own suit-up preparations, FE-5 Williams –·        Verified closure of protective window shutters in Lab, Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and Node-3 Cupola,·        Completed the IV (Intravehicular) portion of the EVA “inhibit pad” by deactivating the CUCU (COTS UHF Communications Unit) equipment because of the US WVS (Wireless Video System) carried on the EMUs, and·        Powered down the amateur/ham radio equipment in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and SM to prevent RF interference during the spacewalk. After ingress from the spacewalk, Suni, Aki, Joe & Yuri completed initial post-EVA activities in the A/L (Airlock) for about an hour, including –Doffing backpacks, harnesses, tethers and EMUs,Inspecting & taking photography of the EMU gloves,Returning Orlan PILLE radiation dosimeters #309 (Suni) & #310 (Aki) to Yuri for data take & stowage,Reconfiguring IAS/STTS communications in the RS,Downlinking spacewalk camera imagery, andDownlinking the glove photographs for analysis. Earlier, at wake-up, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-2 Sergei Revin serviced the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, extracting the top of the bioreactor (#6) from the TBU-V incubator (+29 degC), shaking it with “moderately strong” movements for 2 minutes without taking it out of the case and inserting it again in TBU-V.      [Started on 8/23, this activity is being carried out for 21 days, once in the morning and once in the evening.] Later, in preparation for his 9/16 return to Earth with Soyuz 30S, Sergei performed his first (preliminary) orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test session with the Russian Chibis-M (“Lapwing”) suit by conducting the MedOps MO-4 exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill, assisted by CDR Padalka as CMO and monitored by the ground via VHF telemetry during RGS (Russian Groundsite) overflight at 9:01am – 9:25am EDT.      [The Chibis-M provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by one cycle of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -35, -40 and -45 mmHg for five min. each, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG SHKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis-M data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis-M suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] The CDR conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Gennady also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Later, Padalka performed outfitting on the SM ventilation system for about 1.5 hrs, removing the hard & soft air ducts between the RO/Work Compartment and PkhO/Transfer Compartment and replacing them with new air ducts.  Sergei Revin meanwhile had ~4.5 hrs for thorough clean-up work in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok), using microbial growth wipes & tubes to collect surface samples and Fungistat disinfectant to clean areas on structure surfaces and behind wall panels which have shown some microbial contamination in the past.       [Today’s treatment focused on spaces behind panels 229, 314, 315, 429. The time-consuming work requires clearing cargo out of the way, removing bungees, photographing enclosure spaces, etc.  Areas of interest are accessible frame sections, attachments, mounting bracket, pressurized shell surface areas, panel internal surfaces, etc.] Gennady had another ~2.5 hrs set aside for unloading cargo from Progress M-16M/48P for stowage in ISS, going by an uplinked 36-page transfer/stowage list.      [Transfers of all cargo items have to be documented in the IMS database. KRP food ration containers were stored in MRM1 & FGB, Russian items in FGB in compliance with agreed-upon sharing of FGB stowage areas between Roskosmos and NASA.] The CDR also completed another collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Gennady’s 8th time.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] Before sleeptime, Hoshide & Williams are scheduled for the one session with the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 19th time for both.      [The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2/2x, FE-4), and ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR.    [FE-6 & FE-5 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Suni’s protocol for today was taken over by the EVA-18, with T2 (4 min, int.) tomorrow.  Aki’s protocol showed EVA-18 today, with ARED (resistive)/T2 (aerobic, continuous), T2 (interval, 2 min.), ARED/CEVIS (aerobic, continuous), T2 (int. 30 sec), ARED/CEVIS, T2 (int., 4 min.) for the next 6 days.] After exercising on the TVIS, Revin powered off the treadmill for cool-down for tomorrow’s scheduled 6-month maintenance activity by Yuri & Sergei. Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), and·        A detailed & general view photo session with TEKh-52 Vizir of the flooding which occurred overnight on 8/21-22 at the Black Sea;   [the disaster zone includes the towns Novomikhalovsky, Lermontovo and Tenginka, the Shapsukho & Nechepsukho river valleys and the adjacent mountain region.  Novomikhalovsky is located on the Tuapse-Novorossiisk Highway, 33 km from Tuapse and 14 km from Dzubgi. The town is situated in the Nechepsukho river valley and its tributary Psebe, where Nechepsukho is falling into Mikhalovsky Bay in the Black Sea. As a result of torrential rain the Nechepsukho River flooded.  600 houses, a hospital and a school were in the disaster zone. Four people died, 1500 were affected, including 275 children.  Municipal infrastructures need to be restored. Lermontovo is located on the shores of Tenginsky Bay of the Black Sea, at the inflow of Shapsukho River. The valley of that river is approx. 40 km in length, 5 km to the east of Dzubgi on the Tuapse-Novorosskiisk highway and 55 km from Tuapse. The Tenginka village is located 4 km upriver], and·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.
