ISS On-Orbit Status 04/30/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – crew off duty.  Short crew day: With last night’s late crew bedtime (11:00pm EDT), wakeup this morning allowed for a 5.5 hrs sleep-in, to 7:30am.  Sleep cycle gets back to normal tonight – 5:30pm.  Upon wake-up, CDR Kondratyev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 (oxygen) generator.      [Maxim Suraev installed these filters on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Dmitri inspects the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] As part of the current round of Russian ventilation systems maintenance, Alex Samokutyayev cleaned the fan grille of the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM (Service Module). Afterwards, Sasha serviced the Progress-delivered biotech science payload BTKh-10/KONYUGATSIYA, first relocating it in its Rekomb-K container from the KRIOGEM-03M (at +4 degC) freezer in the SM to the TBU-V (Universal Bioengineering Thermostat V) in MRM2 (at +29degC), leaving it there for 1h50m, then returning it to KRIOGEM-03M (at +4 degC).  Dima shot documentary photos of the activities. The CDR conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~12:55pm, FE-2 Andrey Borisenko used the SM amateur station for a ham radio pass with students and Management of the Peruvian National Engineering University of Lima, Peru.       [In 2010, the Lima ham radio station at National Engineering University was established.  Faculty & students have already conducted several successful radio sessions with ISS crews.  Today’s session was conducted in Russian, with questions asked in Spanish and translated into Russian.  Present were Nikolay Vsevolodovich Sofinsky, Ambassador Extraordinary & Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation Embassy in Peru, Alexander Nikolayevich Khokholikov, Russian Embassy Envoy-Counselor, Carlos Muniz Ortega, Chairman of Peruvian-Russian Cultural Association, a graduate of the Peoples Friendship University, Dr. of Historical Sciences, who had worked in the USSR as an Embassy of Peru Trade representative, and Jose Oliden, the University Space Program manager on behalf of Aurelio M. Padilla, D.Sc. in Engineering, the President of National Engineering University in Peru.] FE-1 & FE-2 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sasha at ~9:40am, Andrey at ~10:25am EDT. On this shortened crew day, the station residents worked out with an abbreviated physical exercise protocol, on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1,  FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-2, FE-5). Progress 42P Deliveries:  The new cargo drone M-10M delivered 2.7 metric tons of cargo consisting of 2,976 lbs (1,350 kg) “dry” goods (food, spares, life support supplies, experiment hardware), 1,940 lbs (880 kg) refueling propellants for transfer to the SM, 926 lbs (420 kg) of water, and 110 lbs (50 kg) of oxygen.

BXF-Facility (Boiling eXperiment Facility, NASA):    Boiling efficiently removes large amounts of heat by generating vapor from liquid.  It is being used in electric power plants, electronic cooling and purification and separation of chemical mixtures.  An upper limit, called the critical heat flux, exists where the heater is covered with so much vapor that liquid supply to the heater begins to decrease. Supplying constant power above this limit for prolonged periods can increase the heater temperature to the point whereby the heater is destroyed. Determination of critical heat flux in microgravity is essential for designing cooling systems for space. Boiling is being studied to increase the effectiveness of cooling in space. The BXF will house two separate investigations, BXF-MABE & BXF-NPBX.  BXF is planned for the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) located in the US Lab.  The purpose of the BXF is to validate models being developed for heat transfer coefficients, critical heat flux and the pool boiling curves. BXF-MABE (Microheater Array Boiling Experiment, NASA):    BXF-MABE uses a 2.7 mm x 2.7 mm and a 7.0 mm x 7.0 mm array of 96 microheaters each.  These microheaters are individually controlled and are operated at constant temperature during boiling.  At the power required to keep the microheaters at the constant temperature with this measurement technique, it is possible to operate the microheaters in a dried out state without burning the microheater out.  Furthermore, the individual control allows different configurations of the microheaters to be tested.  The current plan calls for an array of 10 x 10, 8 x 8 and 6 x 6 microheaters to be tested. Post flight data analysis will include color coding the power measurement from each microheater and overlaying on top of the black and white images from the bottom view camera.  This will correlate the heat transfer measurements with the gas and liquid distribution on the microheater array and enable development of better boiling models in a variety of gravity environments. BXF-NPBX  (Pool Boiling Experiment, NASA):       Nucleate Pool Boiling eXperiment (BXF-NPBX) will provide an understanding of heat transfer and vapor removal processes that take place during nucleate boiling from a well characterized surface in microgravity. Such an understanding is needed for optimum design and safe operation of heat exchange equipment employing phase change for transfer of heat in microgravity.  BXF-NPBX uses a polished aluminum wafer that has five cavities machined into the surface, each about 20 microns in diameter and about 100 microns deep.  Each cavity has its own temperature sensors and resistance heaters.  1, 3 or all 5 cavities can be selected to generate vapor bubbles.  The NPBX test matrix has been crafted to characterize the behavior of single and multiple vapor bubbles nucleation, growth, coalescence and departure.  Data that is obtained will be used to refine and validate numerical models used to predict boiling phenomena. CARD (Long Term Microgravity:  Model for   Investigating Mechanisms of Heart Disease, ESA):     “Dear Paolo, this week you have completed with CARD your last ESA physiology experiment. Despite some difficulties with the PFS gas analyzer and one of the PFS Gas tanks, we can confirm to you that the teams on ground got confirmation of the good handling of at least 3 (out of 5) PFS rebreathing sessions.

GEOFLOW (ESA):    On-going operations, however impacted by 3 anomalies over the last couple of weeks: 1) Experiment Container PID control is skipping some experimental set-points; 2) FSL encountered some TEC power board trip; 3) problem with the Experiment Container Rotating Tray (belt slipping). These anomalies restrict the parameter ranges (Delta T, rotation speed) to perform science runs for the moment. On 4/26, while performing the No-Rotation run#9, a new occurrence of TEC control board trip occurred and the run had to be aborted. While waiting for the delivery of an updated software (to correct the first 2 anomalies), it was decided to change the planning of the week and to perform Medium-High Rotation runs#18b, #19b, #18c, #19c, #18d, #19d, #18e and  #19e, ranging from 0.2K to 1.9K Delta T for rotation speed between 0.2Hz to 1.6Hz. On 4/26, runs# 18b and #19b were successfully completed. On 4/27, the FSL telemetry data froze unexpectedly while performing run#18c. FSL rack had to be power cycled, leading to the abort of the remaining part of this run #18c. Run#19c was skipped and the experimental program was resumed with run#18d. By 4/28, runs #18d, #19d, #18e and #19e were completed without additional problem. Ground teams are now busy downlinking science data. HAIR (JAXA):    No report.

We will continue to request this target as conditions permit.   Your nicely composed view at sunset over Western South America was published this past weekend in NASA/GFSC's Earth Observatory website (seen in the next tab).  This high-oblique view of the Earth and atmospheric limb offers an excellent visualization of light to dark transition zone we know as the terminator.  Thanks for acquiring this fine instructive photo.” CEO targets uplinked for today were Lake Poopo, Bolivia (looking at nadir and left of track to image rising water levels in Lake Poopo.  Also trying to image red algae in the salar lakes immediately uptrack of the lake.  Images from the last increment showed water in the usually dry Salars Uyuni and Coipasa), San Salvador, El Salvador (nadir views of this major Central American capital city [population 541,000], with the city in one frame if possible, were requested.
