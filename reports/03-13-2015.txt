Japanese Experiment Module Airlock (JEMAL) Activation: Virts pressurized and then perform a leak check of the JEMAL. These tasks were performed in advance of operations on March 25 to remove the NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD) and Multi-Purpose Experiment Platform (MPEP)/Small Fine Arm Attachment Mechanism (SAM) from the slide table.
Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI)-3 Cold Box Inspection: Cristoforetti performed regular maintenance on MELFI-3 located in the LAB1S1 rack.  She inspected cables for corrosion and applied Braycote 601 where needed.
Aniso Tubule Closeout (Roles of Cortical Microtubules and Microtubule-associated Proteins in Gravity-Induced Growth Modification of Plant Stems): Cristoforetti deactivated the Multi-Purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR) and removed the Aniso Tubule Run 9 from the Aquatic Habitat (AQH) Microscope. The next Aniso Tubule Run begins with the insertion into MELFI on March 27. This investigation seeks to understand the mechanisms that plants use in growing stems of the correct thickness to support them against gravity. Microtubules, part of a plant cell’s molecular skeleton, align themselves with the local gravity field and thus produce short, thick bodies in hypergravity. This research will germinate Arabidopsis hypocotyls in space and use a fluorescence microscope in the Kibo module to analyze the directions taken by tubules in the stem just below the leaves of new seedlings.
Ocular Exam:  Virts performed an eye exam using the Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) hardware and software.  This exam is part of a systematic gathering of physiological data to characterize the risk of microgravity-induced visual impairment/intracranial pressure in ISS crewmembers.
