H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) Wireless LAN Demonstration: The crew performed the XF305 camera setup in order to allow ground teams to monitor the HTV Wireless LAN Demonstration network data from the SSC16 laptop data. HTV Wireless LAN Demonstration (HTV WLAN Demo) demonstrates real-time wireless video transfer between the International Space Station (ISS) and a visiting spacecraft. Autonomous docking technology is important for future missions, such as to the Moon and Mars, that will be unable to rely on human operations the same way as current vehicle logistics. Stable and high-rate data transfer is critical to the real-time video monitoring required for docking.

Berthing occurred approximately 2 hours later and the crew ingressed the vehicle at 2:25 pm CT. Ingress was originally planned for tomorrow morning but the crew worked diligently to continue with vestibule outfitting to ingress ahead of schedule. The vehicle delivered approximately four tons of supplies, parts, and experiment hardware.
