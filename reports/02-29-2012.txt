ISS On-Orbit Status 02/29/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Happy Leap Day! (see you again in 4 years). After breakfast, FE-4 Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-1 Shkaplerov undertook his 3rd session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.         [FE-2 Ivanishin stood by to assist Anton in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] In the JAXA Kibo laboratory, FE-6 Pettit serviced the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 5 (homogenized on 2/27) once every two hours for seven days.  Crew performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike Fossum’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.] Also in JPM, Pettit prepared the MSPR CC (Multipurpose Small Payload Rack / Combustion Chamber) at loc. A4, making cable connections for a CC power supply checkout, with MTL (Moderate Temperature Loop) cooling, fan, smoke detector etc. activated by the ground for the duration of the checkout.  Afterwards, the activity was closed out, power was turned off and the MSPR A31p laptop was reactivated on 120V DC. In preparation for the ISS reboost maneuver this morning at 5:12am EST, CDR Burbank closed the protective window shutters in the Lab/ Node-3/Cupola and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), while FE-6 Pettit installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) at Lab bay S3, engaged the snubber pins and locked safety pins to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances). After setting up the necessary equipment in the morning, Dan Burbank was the subject for his first session with the periodic 30-min US PHS (Periodic Health Status)/Without Blood Labs exam, with FE-5 Kuipers acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).   FE-5 then logged the data into the DCT (Data Collection Tool) and stowed the equipment.  A subjective evaluation was part of the test.    [The assessment used the AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack), stethoscope, oral disposable thermometer and ABPC (Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff) from the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack).  All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.  The PHS exam is guided by special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.] Dan had another 2 hrs set aside on his timeline to clean the AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) bacteria filters in the three Nodes, the Lab and the A/L (Airlock).      [This cleaning will be done every Wednesday or Thursday for the next four weeks to determine if this helps get ahead of the dust accumulation noted by the crew.  Since the bacteria filter cleanings are done separately, they do not have to be included in the weekly uborka housekeeping on Saturday.] Afterwards, the CDR had ~4 hrs for continuing his upgrading of MDM (Multiplexer/Demultiplexer) computers and PCS (Portable Computer System) laptops, today installing the EPIC (Enhanced Processor & Integrated Communications) hardware in the PL-1 (Payload 1) MDM, replacing the old EIOCU cards, after the PL-2 MDM, upgraded yesterday, was promoted to primary.      [Activities included removing the MDM from the AV-3 (Avionics-3) Rack, installing the new EPIC card, Ethernet Cable, and MDM front cover, and replacing the MDM into the AV-3 Rack.  Tomorrow (3/1), the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) MDM software will be upgraded to version 1.3.  Since there is only one PMM MDM, the PMM will be briefly deactivated during the software transition.] In the Kibo JPM, Dan performed the periodic (~monthly) reboot of the SLT (System Laptop Terminal) laptop. André Kuipers retrieved & stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies which he had deployed on 2/27 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.       [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] In Node-3, André later worked on the WRS2 (Water Recovery System 2), performing maintenance on the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) by hooking up the RFTA (/Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) in the WRS rack for the periodic tank backfill with a QD (Quick Disconnect) hose for processing. Anton Shkaplerov worked with the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for CO (Carbon Monoxide) contamination in the SM, recording the measurements and updating the CO sensor coefficient for calibration.     [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C8H10), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur Dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, Ozone, Acetic Acid, Ammonia, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrous Oxides, Acetone, Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, etc.] Afterwards, Anton had ~2 hrs for conducting the periodic extensive audit/inventory of SLG personal hygiene items (e.g., SLG-3 wet towels) in the RS (Russian Segment).  After filling in tables, the crew was to downlink the file via OCA. Anatoly continued his major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of removing old SMOK condensate lines (smennykh magistralej otkaachki kondensata) of the SOTR Thermal Control System in the SM and replacing them with new spares (last time done: August 2010).      [FE-2 today replaced SMOK sections between the SKV2 air condition unit’s BTA heat exchanger-evaporator and the NOK2 condensate evacuation pump, as well as from NOK1 to NOK2, supported by ground specialist tagup. The IFM will continue until 3/3.] Ivanishin also downloaded the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the reboost, for the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.     [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] Preparatory to the planned launch of more Russian Luch (Altair) communications satellites, Oleg Kononenko used the FSH3 spectrum analyzer to take measurements of Lira antenna feeder parameters, supported by ground specialist tagup.     [The Lira system is a two-way communication system between the ISS RS and TsUP Mission Control via the Russian Luch relay satellite system (when it is complete).  The RS comm subsystem can receive commands directly from RGS (Russian Ground Station) through the Regul subsystem and can receive commands from the Luch satellite through Lira or Regul.  Efforts are underway to rebuilt the Luch relay satellite system after many years of funds-related absence.  Luch-5A was successfully launched on a Proton on 12/11/2011.  Luch-5B & Luch 4 are scheduled for launch this year and 2013.  This should provide the RS with 45 minutes of coverage per orbit via Lira and Regul.] Kononenko, Kuipers & Pettit donned their intravehicular Sokol pressure suits and performed the standard fit-check in their body-contoured Kazbek couches in the TMA-03M/29S spacecraft (#703, docked at MRM1), a 20-min job. Afterwards, André had ~2 hrs for a major cleanup job in the US A/L (Airlock), first consolidating EVA hardware from PMM in preparation to receive ATV3 cargo and then organizing EVA hardware in the A/L C/L (Crewlock) to reduce access times during EMU loop scrubs and decrease snag hazards for EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units).      [Task objectives are to relocate items to more usable locations and better utilize stowage space in A/L & PMM.  Most EVA items will be out of the PMM in anticipation of ATV3 & HTV3.  This activity was also to reconfigure the C/L for easier access to EMUs during loop scrubs.] Later, André completed the monthly maintenance of the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, checking its components, pin alignment, rack centering and the snubber jam nut witness marks.        [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- & Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm; their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.] Activities completed by FE-4 Oleg Kononenko included –The periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways;  [inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.],Transferring US condensate water from CWC (Collapsible Water Container) to the RS (Russian Segment) for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container; once filled, the EDV will be connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit;   [condensate was drawn from CWCs #1072 & #1071.  The 40-minute procedure is specially designed for gas/liquid separation, i.e., to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown],Performing the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM;  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator],Taking care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur),Setting up the KPT-2 payload with its BAR science hardware and using its AU-1 Ultrasound Analyzer to measure background noise in the SM PrK (Transfer Tunnel) and MRM1 Rassvet without and with the VVPRK & VPRK fans turned off, andCompleting the periodic routine maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, replacing the filter insert (F-V) and the urine receptacle (MP) with new spares.FE-2 meanwhile conducted periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), collecting eight Bubble dosimeters (A41, A42, A43, A44, A45, A46, A47, A48) to read their recorded radiation traces in a special Reader.  Afterwards the dosimeters were initialized for new measurements and redeployed.         [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.] Anatoly also did the (currently daily) inspection of the KOB-2 cooling loop #2 of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System in the SM, checking a liquid connector on the 4SPN2 panel for coolant leaks.     [In case there were any large droplets (10-20 cm3), FE-2 was to report to TsUP-Moscow.] Later, Ivanishin conducted the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of KOB-2, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness). FE-5 Kuipers unstowed and set up the KUBIK-3 temperature-controlled cooler in the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) near the EDR (European Drawer Rack), connecting it to EDR for power. In the Lab, André also serviced the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezer in ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2), loc. O1, by replacing its used desiccant packs with fresh ones. Don Pettit had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] FE-1, FE-2 & FE-4 each had an exercise-related PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, discussing workout issues with exercise specialists, Anatoly at ~3:25am, Oleg at ~4:50am, Anton at ~5:15am EST. CDR & FE-6 had their standard PMCs, via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Don at ~10:00am, Dan at ~2:40pm. Before Presleep, Pettit will turn on the MPC and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don will turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).     [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ulttrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2, with CEVIS tomorrow.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Before exercising on the ARED, the crew set up the G1 video camera in Node-3 to cover the workout sessions of Dan, Oleg, André & Don on the machine, to meet the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.  Afterwards, the video footage transferred to VTR (Video Tape Recorder) for ground downlink. Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on Aral Sea, Lake Baikal, the Laganakskoe plateau, the Volga River Delta, Volcano Cordon-Kaul, Allalin Glacier, Lipetsk and Auckland,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). ISS Reboost Update:   A one-burn reboost of the ISS was performed this morning as planned at 5:12am EST using the two KD engines of the SM’s ODU (Integrated Propulsion System) for a burn duration of 76 sec, achieving a Delta-V of 1.24 m/s (planned: 1.2 m/s), increasing mean altitude by 2.1 km (planned: 2.0 km).  After the burn, ISS was at 391.31 km mean altitude, with 408.9 km apogee height and 373.7 perigee height.  The purpose of the reboost was a DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver), to avoid two conjunctions with Object 28471 (CZ-4B rocket body), and to set up proper phasing for Progress 47P launch, Soyuz 29S undock/landing & Soyuz 30S launch. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Baku, Azerbaijan (CAPITAL CITY COLLECTION.     Looking just right of track for this city of over 2 million.  This capital city of Azerbaijan is situated on the south side of the Abseron Peninsula which juts into the Caspian Sea), Monaco, Monaco (CAPITAL CITY COLLECTION.     Looking left: cues were a broad bulge on the coastline and the red roofs of Monaco.  Context views with the 180 mm lens were requested for the capital city image collection), Ljubljana, Slovenia (CAPITAL CITY COLLECTION.     Looking just right of track for the irregular, light-toned valley bottom occupied by this small capital city [273,000] lies), and Budapest, Hungary (CAPITAL CITY COLLECTION.   Near nadir pass.  The beautiful Hungarian capital city of 1.75 million sits astride the Danube River, just southeast of a major right-angle bend.  The river is the primary cue.  Lake Balaton uptrack, also just right of track, is another cue.  Trying for views of the entire urban area within a single frame).
