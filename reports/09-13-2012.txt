ISS On-Orbit Status 09/13/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Upon wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko terminated his 3rd Sonocard experiment session, started last night for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  Yuri also conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  FE-4 will terminate the process at ~5:15pm EDT.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday.  (Done last: 8/22 & 8/23).       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hrs and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.] Later, Malenchenko had ~3 hrs set aside to perform his 3rd session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.      [Gennady Padalka provided assistance in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes, applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit and taking documentary photography.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] FE-2 Revin serviced the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, today removing the bioreactor from the TBU-V incubator (set yesterday to +4degC) and loading it in the Soyuz TMA-04M/30S spacecraft for return, with documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera.    [Started on 8/23, BTKh-26 was serviced for 21 days, once in the morning and once in the evening.] FE-3 Acaba had Day 5 of his 4th (FD120) and final suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of pH testing. In addition to closing out the associated 24-hr urine sample collections, Joe today also underwent the generic blood draw, assisted by Aki Hoshide, then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the JPM MELFI (JEM Pressurized Module Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  After Pro K photography, Joe stowed the equipment used for the urine and blood collections.      [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] FE-6 Hoshide had Day 4 of his 4th (FD120) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of pH testing. After recording his diet input today, Aki began the urine collections for his Nutrition/Repository/Pro K 24-hour protocol and then prepared the equipment for the associated blood sampling (fasted) tomorrow (9/14) with Pro K photography. Hoshide also conducted Part 3 of the periodic noise measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the Soyuz 301S crew, i.e., Gennady (1003), Sergei (#1004) & Joe (#1005), for a 24-hr data take. FE-2 Revin configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 5th, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA memory cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] FE-5 Williams performed major (3h 25m) IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the US OGS (Oxygen Generator System) in Node-3, accessing the unpowered OGS Rack, purging the H2 (hydrogen) Sensor ORU (Orbital Replacement Unit) with the HOPA (Hydrogen Sensor ORU Purge Adapter) for return to Earth, and replacing the H2 Sensor with a new spare, then carefully cleaning the rack AAA (Avionics Air Assembly).     [Sabatier reactor and OGA (Oxygen Generator Assembly) were deactivated & unpowered by the ground at least 3 hrs prior to the activity for cool-down to allowable touch temp. Final step was re-mating the QD (quick disconnect) OGSA jumpers. All parts were then restowed.] With the protective shutters of the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Lab and Cupola windows closed, Gennady Padalka & Sergei Revin prepared for Soyuz 30S undocking & deorbit on 9/16 by spending an hour in the TMA-04M/30S Descent Module (SA) on MRM2 Poisk, supporting, at 2:40am-3:40am EDT, a ground-commanded thruster test and checkout of the Soyuz MCS (Motion Control System) SUDN Mode 2/“Docked” which included pressurization of the KDU (Combined Propulsion System) Section 2 and Tank 2, a test of the pilot’s rotational & translational hand controllers (RUD & RUO), and a hot firing of the DPO braking thrusters while ISS was in free drift.  DPO retrograde thrusters were not fired.       [For the RST (rasstjkovkoy / undocking) test, station attitude was handed over to Russian thruster control at 3:10am.  The one-minute firing started at 3:19am on Daily Orbit 1 during an RGS (Russian Groundsite) pass.  Attitude control was returned to the USOS (U.S. Segment) at 4:20am.] Later, the CDR activated the ASU toilet facility activated in the TMA-04M spacecraft and replaced its collector unit, then turned on the GA (Gas Analyzer) of the vehicle. Afterwards, the 30S crew, Padalka, Revin & Acaba, spent ~3 hrs in the 30S Descent Module to conduct the nominal descent drill, a standard training exercise for every crew returning on this spacecraft.  Results of the exercise, which strictly forbids any command activation (except for switching the InPU display on the Neptun-ME console), were subsequently reported to ground control at TsUP/Moscow.     [Undocking from MRM2 Poisk is currently planned for 9/16 at ~7:12pm EDT. After the undocking, the 30S crew will conduct a visibility test of direct lighting of the MRM2 port with the SSD309 LED floodlight via VSK (Space Vision Sight) & the VKU (Video Control Monitor) and provide a detailed report about how well they can distinguish the target and structural elements. The session included a review of the pertinent ODFs (operational data files), specifically the books on Soyuz Ascent & Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situations, crew responsibilities when executing the flight program, visual crew recognition of SUS (Entry Control System) failures, spacesuit procedures, etc., with special emphasis on operations with the Neptune-ME cockpit console.  The training uses a Descent Simulator application (Trenasher Spusk =”descent trainer”) on the RSK1 laptop.] The GA was also turned on in the Soyuz TMA-05M/31S, docked at MRM1 Rassvet, by Yuri Malenchenko.     [The Gas Analyzers are activated periodically to check the cabin air in the Descent Modules.] FE-6 Hoshide set up the USND (Ultrasound) with video camcorder and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), placed reference markers on thigh & calf of his right leg, donned the SPRINT thigh & calf guides and then, with the help of Suni Williams, performed his 2nd SPRINT leg scan with remote guidance from ground teams.     [SPRINT (Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study) evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise training to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in ISS crewmembers during long-duration missions.] In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Akihiko later turned on the ESA ERB2 (Erasmus Recording Binocular 2) system for ground-controlled operation for the next 1h 20m via Ku-band at a data rate of 8 Mbps.     [This started an internal clock in ERB-2 which shuts the system down after 80 minutes.  Using the stereoscopic ERB-2, the first live 3-D video images in the 50-year history of spaceflight aboard the ISS were produced by Ron Garan in 2011, with imagery streaming live to ESA's Research & Technology Center in the Netherlands.] Preparing the Spider Habitat for an YTSL (YouTube SpaceLab) payload live event, Suni Williams retrieved the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) from its ER-1 (ERXPRESS Rack 1) stowage, remove GAP (Group Activation Pack) #5 and recorded a demo program with the Spider Hab in HD for downlink to YouTube.  Afterwards, Suni stowed the Spider Hab and re-inserted GAP5 in CGBA-4.      [Through an agreement with NASA, Space Adventures is sponsoring the YTSL world-wide contest for students 14-to-18 years old.  Over the past year, students submitted entries in the areas of physics or biology via a two-minute YouTube video.  The top two experiments were selected in March 2012 through online voting and by an international panel of experts, including William Gerstenmaier, Associate Administrator for NASA's Human Exploration Mission Directorate, and Leland Melvin, NASA’s Associate Administrator for the Office of Education.  The winning experiments -- from Egypt and Michigan -- were conducted on the ISS.  One experiment studies how bacteria grow in space to see if different nutrients can block the growth. The other winning entry looks at how spider will hunt its prey in microgravity.  There are actually two “Egyptian” spiders, a red backed spider (Phidippus johnsoni) named Nefertiti and a Zebra spider (Salticus scenicus) named Cleopatra, along with a colony of fruit flies for food.  Background:  The Jumping Spider has 8 eyes. Two pair of eyes sit forward on its “head” (cephalothorax), two other pairs are also there but much harder to see.  Both spiders are unmated females, chosen because unmated females will for the most part continue to eat as adults as long as they are unmated.  Most male spiders upon reaching adulthood stop thinking about food and only think about finding a mate.  The fruit flies in each habitat came in two types, the smaller Drosophila melanogaster and the larger Drosophila hydei.  They will most likely live out their life on board the ISS. They are slated to come back on SpaceX1.  However, by that time, they may or may not be alive.  It will be dependent upon how long the fruit fly colony lasts, how long the water lasts and the overall health of the spider.  Conclusion:  An organism that has evolved for millions of years in a gravitational environment and seems to utilize gravity for its primary hunting behavior (jumping) can learn to adapt relatively quickly in a microgravity environment and hunt successfully.] Malenchenko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Yuri also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). With the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) in Node-3 currently failed, removal & replacement (R&R) of its FCPA (Fluids Control & Pump Assembly) has been scheduled for tomorrow.  In preparation for the IFM, Joe Acaba today retrieved & gathered the necessary hardware.    [On 9/6, the UPA shut down unexpectedly due to high motor current in the FCPA.  Following an unsuccessful restart attempt on 9/7 to gather data and recover UPA functionality, the WHC was configured to collect in internal EDV-U containers while further troubleshooting continued.  On 9/11, one additional restart was unsuccessful in recovering UPA functionality.] In the SM, Malenchenko conducted a checkout/test of the MBRL/PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment) for the upcoming (9/25) undocking & prox ops of ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) “Edoardo Amaldi”, its Antenna Feeder Unit and the PU Control Panel, supported by ground specialist tagup via Ku+S-band. Afterwards, Yuri completed his 4th collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.      [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] FE-6 Hoshide powered up & activated the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System), launched the ABRS laptop application and updated its software configuration as part of an ABRS On-Orbit Functionality Checkout.     [ABRS was last closed out by TJ Creamer on 5/18/10, completing ABRS activities for Increment 23/24.]  Aki also downloaded the accumulated data from Joe’s final (4th/FD135) 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session of yesterday, from two Actiwatch Spectrums and two HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1).  The laptop was then powered off.    [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] With the HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle) gone, Hoshide turned PROX (Proximity Communication System) rack power off in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module). Sunita relocated the EHS IV-TEPC (Environmental Health System Intra-Vehicular Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) from Node-3 at loc. F3 to the SM, Panel 327, activated it and tested communications & data transfer from the radiation instrument to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for later downlink to the ground.  TEPC Audio Alarm was disabled.  The new setup was photo-documented. In preparation for upcoming sessions with the Russian MedOps SZM-MO-21 ECOSFERA equipment, FE-2 Revin initiated charging on the Ecosphere power pack (BP) and set up the refrigerator.     [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger, power supply unit, and incubation tray for Petri dishes, determines microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge at one given time, the sample collection must be performed in two stages.] The 30S crew, Padalka, Acaba & Revin, again had an hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which is standard pre-return procedure for homecoming crewmembers. Joe performed his weekly task of filling out the SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after his Soyuz launch on a daily basis and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space. FE-5 & FE-6 had their standard weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Aki at ~10:30am, Suni at ~1:50pm EDT. At ~3:05am, Suni Williams powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 3:15am conducted a ham radio session with students at the Gymnasium Unterrieden, Sindelfingen, Germany. At ~5:30am, Aki Hoshide conducted the weekly JAXA crew conference via phone with staff at SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center) at Tsukuba, Japan. At ~9:30am, Suni, Joe & Aki conducted a 30-min teleconference with ground specialists to discuss Crew Handover particulars for the upcoming three-crew (31S) segment of Increment 33 where Suni will be Commander. At ~12:40pm, Aki Hoshide readied the SM's amateur radio equipment and at 12:50pm supported a ham radio session with students at NASA Goddard’s Child Development Center, Greenbelt, MD. At ~2:10pm, Suni again took over the SM's amateur radio equipment and at 2:20pm conducted a ham radio session with students at the Burns Sci-Tech Chapter School, Oak Hill, FL. Before Presleep (~3:40pm), Acaba turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.    [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [FE-6 & FE-5 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Suni’s protocol for today showed ARED/CEVIS (cont.).  Aki’s protocol for today showed SPRINT/USND (Ultrasound).] Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C・        A detailed & general view photo session with TEKh-52 Vizir of the disastrous flooding which occurred overnight on 8/21-22 at the Black Sea,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,Personal iPad setup for operation with new WAP2 through SM WAP (Wireless Access Point) encryption by NASA, andFilming an HD video of congratulations to the Scientific Production Enterprise “Zvezda” on its 60th anniversary. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Typhoon Sanba (Dynamic Event: Typhoon Sanba is projected to become a very strong Category 4 storm over the next few days as it tracks NNW towards the East China Sea and the southern islands of Japan. As ISS tracked SE southeast over Taiwan and the Philippine Sea, the crew was to look just left of track to take short lens shots of the storm. CEO staff would like to see how this storm progresses over the next few days. An eye should be visible to shoot by the time ISS passes over it), Moscow, Russia (Capital Cities Collection:  The Russian capital of 11.5 million is located at approximately 55.8N and lies well left of any ISS orbit tracks.  At this time as the crew tracks eastward in good weather, they were to aim camera obliquely left of track for this sprawling urban area), B.P. Impact, Libya (Terrestrial Impact Craters: ISS had a midday pass in clear weather for this target with approach from the NW.  B.P. is an exposed impact crater that is 2 km in diameter and is estimated to be less than 120 million years in age.  At this time the crew was to begin looking in the vast Libyan Desert for this feature and its visual cues.  Although small, it is somewhat distinctive because of its circular shape.  A local visual cue is an S-bend ridge near the crater ), Plum Island Ecosystem, MA (Long Term Ecological Research Site [LTER]:  The Plum Island Sound is comprised of its estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent Gulf of Maine. Study here focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes and how they interact with the external drivers [climate, land use, river discharge, and sea level].  ISS had a clear weather pass approaching from the NW in early afternoon light.  At this time as ISS tracked SE over the coast NW of Cape Cod, the crew was to shoot just right of track and try for detailed mapping views of this area), Paramaribo, Suriname (Capital Cities Collection:  This capital city is located just inland from the coast on the west bank of the Suriname River estuary and has a population of about 250,000.  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass with good weather expected.  As ISS approached the coast from the NW, the crew was to look just right of track for single-frame views of this small city), and Mount Hood, OR-USA (Oregon’s highest peak (11,249 feet) is a glacially eroded volcano astride the crest of the Cascade Range. Visual cues are the nearby line of Columbia River to the north, and Portland 50 miles to the west. The last eruptive period took place around 170-220 years ago, when lahar deposits extended as far as the Columbia River. The remnants of this eruption were most likely observed by members of the 1804-1805 Lewis and Clark expedition a few years later. As ISS tracked SE over the Pacific Northwest, the crew was to look just left of track to spot this snowy peak).
