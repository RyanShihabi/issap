ISS On-Orbit Status 04/19/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Upon wake-up, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 (oxygen) generator.      [Maxim Suraev installed these filters on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Alexandr inspects the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] FE-6 Coleman undertook her 18th weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for her last night.  This activity, usually on Monday, was erroneously reported yesterday.       [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]  FE-2 Borisenko conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  Andrey will terminate the process at ~5:05pm EDT before sleep time.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday.      [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days. Last time done: 3/28-3/29.] Andrey also conducted the routine verification of yesterday’s periodic IUS AntiVirus scans on the Russian VKS auxiliary (non-network) laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p, RSK2 & RSE1 which are not loaded from the ground.      [Regularly on Mondays, automatic virus definition file updates are verified on the RSS2, RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 laptops, while the non-networked laptops RSE-Med & RSE1 are manually updated.  Antivirus scans are then started & monitored on RSS2 & RSE-Med.  On Tuesdays, results of the overnight scans on RSS1, RSK1-T61p, RSK2 & RSE1 are verified.  Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] FE-1 Samokutyayev terminated his 3rd session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiograph) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2 protocol.      [After the ECG recording and BP (blood pressure) measurements with the Kardiomed system, Sasha doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  The data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] Later, Andrey Borisenko started his 2nd session of the MedOps PZE MO-2 24-hour protocol of ECG & BP measurements. FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Nespoli & FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 4th for Ron, the 27th for Paolo & Cady.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-3 Garan reconfigured power cabling for the MMA (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus) on the Kobairo Rack for micro-G measurements.     [There are two RSUs (Remote Sensing Units), one on the Kobairo Rack (bay F3) and the other on the Ryutai Rack (bay A3).  Both must share a single 28V power outlet on the UDC2 (Utility DC/DC Converter 2) located on Ryutai.  The periodic power cable switch depends on which rack is conducting science.  On 4/11, Ron had to switch to the Ryutai Rack.] On the Kobairo Rack, Garan then uninstalled the MMA RSU (Remote Sensor Unit) and replaced it with a spare RSU. In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-5 Nespoli installed & configured the equipment required for the next ESA PASSAGES experiment sessions, setting up the ESA MPL (Multipurpose Laptop) BIOS and installing the PASSAGES gear (NeuroSpat light shield, trackball) in front of the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack.  Paolo then conducted the session as subject (no glasses allowed), his 2nd onboard, collecting science data on the EPM laptop.     [PASSAGES is designed to test how astronauts interpret visual information in weightlessness: it aims at studying the effects of micro-G on the use of the ‘Eye-Height’ strategy for estimating allowed actions in an environment, and whether this could possibly decrease after a long exposure to weightlessness.  The first onboard run was performed by Paolo Nespoli on 1/3.] Later, FE-3 Garan & FE-6 Coleman each also performed their first onboard runs with the PASSAGES experiment.      [Cady then stowed the equipment.  For downlinking the data, Cady inserted the PASSAGES PCMCIA (Portable Computer Memory Card International Adapter) memory card into the EPM laptop and afterwards reconnected its power cable to its original EDR (European Drawer Rack) laptop.  The PCMCIA was placed in the PASSAGES kit, which was then put back in the NeuroSpat kit.] At ~11:15am EDT, the entire crew held their first joint fire drill/OBT (on-board training), a mandatory periodic 70-min exercise (including crew review and subsequent 15-min ground debrief conference at 1:50pm) to practice initial crew actions in response to an onboard fire.      [Primary goal of this Russian-led interactive exercise is to maintain crew skills in responding to a fire and to provide the station residents with the most realistic emergency training possible.  The drill is always conducted with the support of all MCCs (TsUP-Moscow, TsUP-Kazakhstan, MCC-Houston, COL-CC, SSIPC/Tsukuba) in close coordination.  It should be performed every 2.5 months, but not later than 1 month prior to end of Increment.  OBT objectives are to (a) practice fire response procedures (FRPs) and all incorporated actions for the case of a software-detected fire to locate, extinguish, and verify extinguishing attempts; (b) browse through RS laptop and the Signal-VM fire detection system displays as well as the automated software (algorithms) response to the fire event; (c) practice crew communication necessary to perform emergency FRPs;  (d) ensure familiarization with support equipment (CSA-CP compound specific analyzer-combustion products, PBAs portable breathing assemblies, PFE/OSP-4 portable fire extinguishers, and IPK-1M gas masks to be used for fire suppression).  These exercises do not actually use any fire equipment but simulate such actions with comm channels, PBAs, CSA-CP and laptop displays to the maximum extent possible.  The Emergency Procedures OBT concluded with a 15-min. debrief with Russian/U.S. ground specialists at ~1:50pm via S-band.] Paolo & Cady completed a session each with the U.S. HMS VIS (Health Maintenance Systems / Visual Acuity) testing program, using an eye chart for both far & near visual acuity and filling out an eye questionnaire for downloading on a laptop for ground access. FE-6 Coleman reconfigured SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) in the HRF1 (Human Research Facility 1) rack by moving the SLAMMD equipment from location E2 to D2 and also reconfiguring the stowage drawers.      [This is necessary in order to “deconflict” (make room) for the calibration arm from the MARES (Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System) Y-Guide.] Nespoli installed the four CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) alignment guides to protect the PaRIS (Passive Rack isolation System) against disturbances.  Coleman set up the SLAMMD hardware, connected the HRF laptop with its software to SLAMMD and powered on the device.  Cady then performed BMM (Body Mass Measurement) activities for herself, after conducting a control run to verify its calibration.  Afterwards, Ron Garan also used SLAMMD, followed by Paolo Nespoli, who then powered off, disassembled and stowed the equipment.      [SLAMMD, performed first on Expedition 12 in December 2005, provides an accurate means of determining the on-orbit mass of humans spanning the range from the 5th percentile Japanese female to the 95th percentile American male.  The procedure, in accordance with Newton’s 2nd Law of Motion, finds the mass by dividing force, generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer, by acceleration measured with a precise optical instrument that detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing.  The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.  To calculate their mass, crewmembers wrap their legs around a leg support assembly, align the stomach against a belly pad and either rest the head or chin on a head rest.  For calibration, an 18-lbs. mass is used at different lengths from the pivot point, to simulate different mass values.  Crew mass range is from 90 to 240 lbs.] CDR Kondratyev used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM (Service Module) window #9 during a 4.5-min span, taking pictures of Patagonian glaciers and vegetation, Pacific & Atlantic coastal & water areas, and the Falkland Islands, downloading the recorded session data for downlink.    [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS  includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] With the Sony HVR-Z7E camcorder (Sony HVR-Z7 #2), FE-1 Samokutyayev shot the first test sequences for an OBR-5 (Obrazovanie-5, Education 5) session for Russian PAO TV, called “Great Beginning”.     [Scenes captured close-ups of Dmitri Kondratyev performing operations with the Uragan equipment in the SM, such as removing FSS from storage, installing mounting brackets at SM window #9, demonstrating camera swiveling, showing FSS taking recordings, transferring data to a digital map and winding up, after about 10-12 minutes, with session finish.] Other activities performed by Sasha Samokutyayev included –·        Setting up and operating the Russian BTKh-43 KONSTANTA (#11) biotech payload with Cassettes #1 & #2, supported by ground specialist tagup   [BTKh-43, comprising the Recomb-K hybridizer bioreactor plus photo & video equipment with two SPR-1 portable lights, studies potential effects of spaceflight factors and their nature on the activity of a model enzyme relative to a specific substrate (bioreactors are specialized hardware for growing, cells, tissues, and microorganisms)],Performing the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways to see how the ventilation/circulation system is coping with the 6-person crew   [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1],Unstowing & conducting a Ku-band test of the new Klest KL-103Ts video camera system by setting it up, letting it be powered up/down from the SPP automated onboard program sequencer and monitoring its TV signal in the SM periodically during the ground-controlled Ku-band test, later disassembling and stowing the equipment, andWorking on the TVIS treadmill (after being the last TVIS user of the day) to secure an SLD (Subject Loading Device) eyebolt with a tie wrap from the IVA tool kit. FE-2 Borisenko meanwhile –Checked out proper communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, and then downloaded data accumulated from the GFI-7 Molniya-GAMMA experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28     [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity],Configured the Russian STTS communications system in the MRM2 Poisk module for crew presence, then Conducted an active session for the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal) in MRM2, followed by downlinking the video footage obtained with two SONY HVR-Z1J camcorders over an RGS (Russian Groundsite) pass (2:05pm) and reconfiguring STTS to nominal,   [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS (Russian Segment): condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism],Performed the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWC (Collapsible Water Container) #1039 to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit   [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O2 generator] andCompleted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] The CDR handled the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). In the Lab, FE-5 Nespoli activated CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1045 & #1046 and recorded their O2 concentrations, battery ticks and time values for downlinking to MCC-Houston for a health check of the O2 sensor of #1045 (which has exceeded its shelf life). Nespoli also replaced the KTO solid waste container in the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) with a fresh one and transferred the filled container to Progress 41P for disposal. Dmitri Kondratyev again had several hours assigned for 41P transfer operations, loading waste and excessed items to the cargo ship, to be undocked in three days (4/22) for destructive reentry on 4/26. Cady Coleman conducted the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.     [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Ron Garan spent ~1 hr with Cady in another handover session, the 6th, during which Cady familiarized her compatriot with USOS (US Segment) activities. In an additional handover, Cady & Ron powered on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and started the data flow to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center/Huntsville) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  MPC was later turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] A second crew handover session of ~1h with Nespoli followed for Ron, to familiarize him with Paolo’s work regime. Paolo & Cady worked another hour on the daily ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) cargo operations, finishing unloading & transfer of cargo to the ISS.  For the rest of the week, the two crewmembers will begin gathering items from ISS to bring to “Johannes Kepler”. The three newcomers, Sasha, Andrey & Ron, again had their free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. At ~3:30pm, Nespoli is scheduled for the daily tagup with MCC-Houston to debrief on today’s ATV cargo transfers. CDR, FE-1, FE-2 & FE-5 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Sasha at ~8:05am, Paolo at ~8:25am, Dima at ~12:10pm, Andrey at ~2:30pm, EDT. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Foelsche Impact Crater, North Australia (looking right for this 6-km-diameter crater.  It stands out as a lighter-toned, circular feature.  Ages of the surrounding rocks show that the impact occurred more than 545 million years ago.  Today’s relatively low sun angle view will have enhanced the features of the crater), Juan de Nova Island, Madagascar (looking near nadir for this small island [6 km long].  Juan de Nova has a major coral reef on its northern shore, larger than the island itself.  There are no complete images of the reef in the CEO database used in a world reef mapping project), Central Mediterranean pass:  Cities at night (looking left for Valletta [capital of the island nation of Malta], then Palermo and Naples), and Monaco–Budapest pass: Cities at night (nadir/near nadir views from Monaco and cities of the Riviera, over northern Italy, to Vienna, then Budapest).
