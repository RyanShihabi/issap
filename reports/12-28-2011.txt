ISS On-Orbit Status 12/28/11  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  After wakeup, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit completed their 2nd post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol. [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS. The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]  FE-2 Ivanishin started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today changing out the cartridges of the four dust filters (PF1-4) in the SM, discarding the used cartridges, and then cleaning “Group B” fan screens in the MRM1 “Rassvet” module after taking documentary photography.  Afterwards, Anatoly conducted periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), collecting eight Bubble dosimeters (A21, A22, A27, A28, A33, A34, A35, A36) to read their recorded radiation traces in a special Reader.  Afterwards the dosimeters were initialized for new measurements and redeployed.    [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies. Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]  FE-4 Kononenko undertook his first session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop. [A crewmember stood by to assist Oleg in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit. Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm. MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes. The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris. The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate. It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms. An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]  With the RS STTS communications system configured for working in the MRM2 Poisk module, Kononenko installed and prepared the equipment for another run of the new KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall-3 plus) Telescience payload, the first time for Expedition 30. The FE-4 then conducted a leak check on the EB vacuum chamber, loaded new software, copied and downlinked data & log files and later returned the STTS comm system to nominal.  Ivanishin took documentary photography of the activities which were also supported by ground specialist tagup.  [The PK-3+ hardware comprises the EB (Eksperimental’nyj Blok) Experiment Module with a turbopump for evacuation, Ts laptop, video monitor, vacuum hoses, electrical circuitry, four hard storage disks for video, and one USB stick with the control application. After setting up the hardware in MRM2 (it used to be run in the SM/Service Module), Sergey today configured vacuum and electrical connections, installed external hard drives and conducted a leak check on the electronics box. The experiment is performed on plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber. Main objective is to obtain a homogeneous plasma dust cloud at various pressures and particle quantities with or without superimposition of an LF (low frequency) harmonic electrical field. The experiment is conducted in automated mode.PK-3+ has more advanced hardware and software than the previously used Russian PKE-Nefedov payload.]  After yesterday’s reviews and teleconference for this week’s EPIC (Enhanced Processor & Integrated Communications) card testing and X2R10 software transition, CDR Burbank & FE-6 Pettit today started out on the activities, with the Lab camcorder installed to cover the scene.        [The software transition work will nominally span nine days, including several days of EPIC card testing and card installations, and several “dwell” days to monitor the upgraded MDMs (Multiplexer/Demultiplexer) computers.  Operationally this transition is more of a series of IFMs (Inflight Maintenances) than a traditional software transition. The EPIC Unit (EIOCU, also known as the processor card) in the C&C MDMs (3 of them) and GNC MDMs (2 of them) will be replaced with the EPIC version of the processor card.  Six cards launched on Progress 43P were loaded with CCS R10 & GNC R9 software; four cards delivered on 29S were loaded with CCSR10 and PEPR10. The new software contains the same functionality as the previous versions; it is just running on a faster, more capable processor card.  Today, on Day 1 of the X2R10 transition, Dan had about 6 hrs to upgrade the C&C-1 (Command & Control 1) MDM, while Don was setting up and testing the GNC-2 (Guidance, Navigation & Control) MDM’s EPIC card. ]  FE-5 André Kuipers’ busy schedule today included – · Starting a sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor) and deactivating the system ~5 hrs later; [consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop. The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer). This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware], Conducting the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose; [after the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged], Replacing the faulty ESEM-1 (Exchangeable Standard Electronic Module 1) module behind the front panel of the MSG RPDA (Microgravity Science Glovebox Remote Power Distribution Assembly) with the new spare ESEM retrieved by the CDR on 12/22, and later activating the MSG;    [this ESEM is used to distribute station main power to the entire MSG facility; its replacement restores functionality to the MSFG rack], Performing regular maintenance calibration on the sensors of the two CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1043 & #1048, Completing Zero calibration on the new CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) monitors delivered on Progress 45P, after they had time for outgassing;   [the old units, #1060, #1070, #1071, #1072 were stowed for return], Unpacking and stowing the HMS IMAK (Health Maintenance System ISS Medical Accessory Kit) delivered on Soyuz 29S, Conducting the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 22 min, a partial fill during which WHC was not available, Restocking the HRF (Human Research Facility) supply kit, removing expired life items removed and taking documentary photography, Reviewing briefing material for his upcoming first ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Echo scanning activity, and Reviewing VIS (Vessel Imaging) payload material to familiarize himself with procedures for his first vascular echography session in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory); [Vascular Echography (Vessel Imaging) evaluates the changes in central and peripheral blood vessel wall properties (thickness and compliance) and cross sectional areas of long-duration ISS crewmembers during and after long-term exposure to microgravity. An LBNP (Lower Body Negative Pressure) program will be run in parallel to Vessel Imaging. Flow velocity changes in the aorta and the middle cerebral and femoral arteries will be used to quantify the cardiovascular response to fluid shift. Vessel Imaging aims to optimize the countermeasures used routinely during long-duration space missions.]  In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Don Pettit supported SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center/Tsukuba) by performing troubleshooting on the GHF (Gradient Heating Furnace) controller which on 12/15 unexpectedly powered off.       [To help understand ground engineers what had happened, Don was to check a software error switch and reset it if it was in the error position; also, to downlink photo imagery of the configuration.]  Anatoly Ivanishin had another 2h 20m for more unloading & transferring of cargo from Progress 45P to the ISS for stowage, guided by an uplinked loading plan and logged in the IMS (Inventory Management System). [Of the approximately 1166 listed entries on 45P, about 404 are USOS items. Progress M-13M is to remain docked at the DC1 for about 3 months, and its unloading continues as a long-term activity.]   FE-4 Kononenko reviewed VKS Computer System procedural material to familiarize himself with the current situation of onboard Russian & USOS laptops and LAN computer network, including the Ethernet and auxiliary laptops, antivirus update procedures, etc.       [Russian laptops comprise RSS1 (T61p), RSS2 (T61p), RSE-Med (A31p), RSE1 (A31p), RSK1-T61p,RSK2-T61p, RSE-LCS (A31p) & RSK1-A31p.  USOS laptops (all T61p) are SSC1, SSC2, SSC3, CSL5, & CSL6.]  Later, FE-4 started his first session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2-1 protocol which monitors human cardiovascular performance in the space flight environment. [After 24 hrs of ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed (CDM) system, Oleg will doff the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads and recorded on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit. The examination results will then be downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by theKardiomed application. Later, the data will be downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]  Oleg also broke out & readied the equipment for his and André’s first session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), to be conducted tomorrow right after wake-up. [MO-10 measures the red cell count of the blood. It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.]  Joining up for an Exp-30/Exp-31 handover opportunity, Burbank & Kuipers conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies. Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes. [The current card (29-0008C) lists 31 CWCs (480.7 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (5 CWCs with 179.5 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria; 2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 19.1 L), 7 empty bags; 3. Iodinated CWCs with 186.4 L; also 3 expired bags with 59.1 L); 4. Waste water (1 bag with 6.4 L EMU waste water); and 5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush). Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents. Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources. These isolates pose no threat to human health.]  Also as a handover activity, Dan & André jointly performed the periodic evacuation of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration. [The cylinders always have a very minute leak. If air is not removed from them, ARED loads will not be true to scale. After a complete cylinder evacuation, ARED loads can feel significantly higher.]  Activities completed by FE-1 Anton Shkaplerov included – Checking out proper MKSD Control & Data Acquisition Module communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, then copying science & service data, accumulated from the GFI-17 Molniya-GAMMA (“Lightning-GAMMA”) experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28, over to external media (16 GB flash card), followed later (~9:35am EST) by initiating their downlink from the RSK1 laptop to the ground via OCA; [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity], Completing the periodic routine maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, changing out replaceable parts with new components, such as a filter insert (F-V), the urine receptacle (MP), the pre-treat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pre-treat & water dispenser;  [all old parts were trashed for disposal, and the IMS was updated. E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid), CrO3 (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H2O (water). The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing], Using the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 and the overnight freshly charged FSS photo spectrograph battery, taking pictures of targets along the flight track during a one-hour segment; [the FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module. FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module], Continuing his troubleshooting of the failed SEP (Electric Power System/EPS) power bus controller on channel B (uncommanded deactivation) begun on 12/19, by performing continuity checks (resistance measurements) with the MMTs-01 Multimeter on the BSK-7,5 power-switching device (blok silovoiy kommutatsii) circuits, supported by ground specialist tagup, Performing the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM; [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of theKTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator], Collecting & downloading the periodic sensor readings of the Russian “Pille-MKS” (MKS = ISS) radiation dosimetry experiment which has 11 sensors placed at various locations in the RS (DC1, SM starboard & port cabin windows, ASU toilet facility, control panel, MRM2, MRM1, etc.) and four in CQs;   [the memory/flash card was then replaced. Today’s readings were taken manually from all 11 deployed dosimeters and logged on a data sheet.  The dosimeters take their readings automatically every 90 minutes], Completing the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO2 (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit; [the AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA). Access to vacuum is required to vent CO2 during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP)], and Performing his 4th collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file;[the software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log. Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]  FE-2 Ivanishin did the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways, a prudent preparation for the imminent doubling of the station crew size. [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO,PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]  Anatoly also conducted the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness).  Later, FE-2 took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).  CDR Burbank has another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on his personal SSC (Station Support Computer). [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]   The 29S crewmembers Kononenko, Pettit & Kuipers again had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.  Before Presleep, Dan will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link). After about an hour, Dan will turn MPC routing off again. [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]  Before sleeptime, Kononenko will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his first Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin. Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.[Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data. Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  At ~6:00am EST, Oleg ran a communications test on Ku- & S-band with the ground in preparation for tomorrow’s scheduled annual Greetings from Roskosmos Management to the IOSS crew.  At ~7:45am, Dan had his standard weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- & Ku-band audio/video.  The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).  The Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list for Shkaplerov, Ivanishin & Kononenko today called for continued preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
