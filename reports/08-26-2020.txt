Combustion Integrated Rack/Advanced Combustion via Microgravity Experiments (CIR/ACME): The crew replaced the Gas Chromatograph (GC) helium bottle, GC check gas bottle, and manifold bottles 2 and 4.  During these bottle exchanges they also performed quick-disconnect (QD) lubrication to prevent the potential for any future leaks at the QD interfaces.  The bottle exchanges are in preparation for the upcoming BRE part 2 (Burning Rate Emulator), which is one of the ACME suite of five experiments.  The BRE experiment runs are focused on spacecraft fire prevention. More specifically, BRE’s objective is to improve our fundamental understanding of materials flammability and to assess the relevance of existing flammability test methods for low and partial-gravity environments.

Hurricane Laura Response: In preparation for Hurricane Laura, Mission Control operations was handed over to the the Backup Control Center Activation Team (BAT) located in Palestine, TX.  The BAT team and the International Partners have access to command and telemetry through US assets during this time. Changes were made to the timeline for the next few days to defer activities requiring significant interaction with US ground specialists.
ISS Leak Isolation: This morning, the crew re-ingressed the JEM module. Ground teams will review data and prepare conclusions and recommendations following the module isolation activity. The ECLS Community has been tracking an increase in nominal atmosphere leakage since October 2019.
