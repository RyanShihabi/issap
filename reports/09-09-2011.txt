ISS On-Orbit Status 09/09/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, CDR Borisenko performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel.     [The crew has reported numerous instances of a spurious C&W tone early in the morning, and the daily PSS test is being suspected as cause.  A dedicated series of SM tests will be performed with the crew listening for the tone in their CQs (Crew Quarters).] FE-1 Samokutyayev took care of the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness). After setting up the G1 HD camcorder in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) for ground monitoring, FE-3 Garan had ~2h50m set aside for troubleshooting the JAXA ICS (Inter-Orbit Communication System).      [Ron was to determine the location of a short circuit in the power line by taking resistance measurements on the ICS Rack power feed path from the IP-PCDU (Power Control & Distribution Unit) in the ICS-PM (Pressurized Module) to the MUX (Data Multiplexer), EIU (Ethernet Interface Unit) or IMCU (Image Compression Unit).] FE-4 Volkov completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and ensured proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.      [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] With VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) set up in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to monitor his FSL (Fluids Science Laboratory) and FSL VMU (Video Management Unit) activities, FE-6 Fossum changed the VMU Hard Disks HDD1 & HDD2, replacing the 30GB disks with the advanced 146GB units. Next, FE-6 installed the four PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab to protect it from external loading (dynamic disturbances). With the Lab camcorder set up to view CIR from the Node-1 side, and after verifying the main & auxiliary RPCs (Remote Power Controllers) to be open and touch temperatures within limits, Fossum serviced the CIR by removing/replacing a manifold bottle on one of four manifolds in front of the Optics Bench.       [Steps included opening the upper doors, removing CIR manifold bottle A (#2005) containing 100% CO2  (carbon dioxide) with 339 psia pressure remaining, and replacing it with manifold bottle D (#2002) containing 100% He (helium), then closing the upper doors again, turning on two switches, and notifying POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) that the rack was prepared for RPC commanding on.] Mike then removed the alignment guides again to allow PaRIS activation for ground-commanded CIR ops in micro-G. FE-5 Furukawa started the day by opening the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Satoshi will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] Afterwards, Satoshi spent most of his working hours on the continuing troubleshooting of VCAM (Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Module) cabling, first reviewing procedural IFM (Inflight Maintenance) material, then transferring necessary tools to COL for the VCAM cable inspection, and setting up the VCA2 camera for “over-the-shoulder” viewing of the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) with the VCAM payload as well as the de- & remating of cables and their inspection.       [The JPL-developed VCAM identifies gases that are present in minute quantities in the ISS breathing air that could be harmful to crew health.  If successful, instruments like VCAM could accompany crewmembers during long-duration exploration missions.  Similar to the earlier employed VOA (Volatile Organic Analyzer), VCAM can provide a means for monitoring the air within enclosed environments, using a miniature preconcentrator, GC (gas chromatograph), and mass spectrometer for unbiased detection of a large number of organic species.  VCAM's software can identify whether the chemicals are on a targeted list of hazardous compounds and their concentration.  A VCAM calibration gas is used periodically to check how the instrument’s components are actually performing.  The raw data, calibration data, and analysis results are all sent to the ground for further assessment to validate the instrument’s detection, identification, and quantification results.] Sergei Volkov took the (approx.) monthly O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.      [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There has been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.] For the Russian experiment BTKh-11 Biodegradatsiya ("Biodegradation”), Volkov collected the periodic bio samples from specific metallic equipment and structures for stowage in the 26S Descent Module for microbial analysis on Earth.       [Samples were collected in the SM behind panels 139 & 407, from the BKS cable system behind panel 221, from behind Elektron-VM panel 429, at the VV ventilation fan in the SM PrK Transfer Tunnel and in the DC-1 Docking Compartment behind panels 201 & 401.  The activities were documented by Sergei with the Nikon D2X digital camera with SB 28DX flash attachment for downlink via OCA.] With the FSS Photospectrograph battery freshly charged overnight, Sergei used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 during a one-hour segment, taking pictures of targets along the flight track, including the Popocatepetl volcano, shore line & water area of the Gulf of Mexico, typical targets on US & Canadian territory, shore line & water area of the Atlantic Ocean, typical targets on French territory, and the Allalin glacier.  Sasha filmed video footage of Sergei’s GFI-8 activities.        [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] Volkov conducted the regular transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWCs (Contingency Water Containers) #1064 (6 L) & #1069 (21 L) to the RS (Russian Segment) for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  When filled, the EDV was to be connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O2 generator.] Borisenko & Samokutyayev spent two hours conducting Part 1 of the Soyuz descent OBT (Onboard Training) for “their” 26S spacecraft (#231), a standard training exercise for every crew returning on this spacecraft.   Results of the simulation exercise, which did not yet require Ron Garan’s participation, were subsequently reported to ground control at TsUP-Moscow.      [The session included a simulation of the descent in manual control mode (RUS), a briefing on the return stowage plan & cargo list, and self-study of Descent Timeline #1 & transition procedures to RUS.  The drill uses a Descent Simulator application (Trenasher Spusk =”descent trainer”) on the RSK1 laptop.] Later, the CDR spent ~2 hrs in the MRM1 “Rassvet” module on the periodic Russian SPOPT (Fire Detection & Suppression System) maintenance by dismantling its three IDZ-2 smoke detectors, cleaning their ionizing needles and then reinstalling the sensors.        [Part of the job is to inspect surrounding areas behind panels and to clean those surfaces and the inlet grille with microbial growth wipes.  IDZ-2 smoke detector cleaning in MRM2 “Poisk” was performed on 9/7 by Volkov.] Borisenko did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Andrey also completed the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Spacecraft, DC1–Spacecraft, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] Alex Samokutyayev performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sasha also had another ~2h10m reserved for loading discarded cargo & waste on the Soyuz 26S BO Orbital Module which will be jettisoned on 9/15 along with the PAO Service Module and burn up on its atmospheric descent path.     [During the evening DPC (Daily Planning Conference) at ~3:00pm, Samokutyayev is to report on Soyuz 26S loading completion.] Mike Fossum conducted the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.       [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Mike also collected samples of potable water from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient port, i.e., 250 mL in a bag for TOCA analysis, and 125 mL in a bag for microbial in-flight analysis.      [The latter samples were subsequently processed in the MCD (microbial capture device) and CDB (coliform detection bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection.] Afterwards, FE-6 accessed the WRS and reconfigured the setup for the periodic RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) backfill with a QD (Quick Disconnect) hose, which was then stowed and the RFTA activity closed out. Furukawa performed special inspection & service on the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System) exercise device by replacing one of the isolators (“D”), with another one, isolator (“A”).  Depending on its condition, “D” was or was not to be installed in the “A” location.  FE-5 also was asked to check on the current location of six CEVIS hardmount assemblies.       [During Satoshi’s CEVIS inspection on 9/2, isolator “D” was found to be very close to the failure criterion of 9 severed wires.  Since there are no spares on board until Progress 45P arrival, the current plan involves weekly inspections, swapping isolator locations and potentially using worn spares as required.   The hardmount assemblies are required to mount CEVIS “hard”, if analysis confirms that this configuration is acceptable.]  Garan continued his work in Satoshi’s Starboard CQ (Crew Quarters), with part-time assist by Mike Fossum providing “knowledge handover”, cleaning the IMV (Intermodular Ventilation) intakes & exhaust outlets. Fossum continued the troubleshooting of a temperature sensor of the Lab CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) Bed 202, which has exhibited intermittent operation, i.e. degradation, causing CDRA to be put on extended Standby.      [For the troubleshooting, which started on 8/25, Mike inspected and re-checked pin/socket test jumper connections inside the CDRA rack at D6.] At ~3:55am EDT, the six crewmembers held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~4:30am, Sasha, Andrey & Sergei linked up with TsUP stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~4:50am, the Russian crewmembers supported two Russian PAO TV downlinks, transmitting messages of greetings & congratulations to (1) the attendees of the 46th regular Tsiolkovsky Memorial Scientific Readings on 9/13-15 in Kaluga, and (2) the participants of a celebration on 9/19 in honor of the 75th anniversary of Tsiolkovsky Museum in Kaluga.       [Since 1966, the Tsiolkovsky State Museum of Cosmonautics History in Kaluga, together with academic, scientific and public organizations of Russia, has held annual Scientific Readings dedicated to the development of scientific legacy and ideas of Tsiolkovsky. The idea of having such readings on the birthday of Tsiolkovsky (Constantine Tsiolkovsky was born on 9/5(17)/1857) came from a group of prominent scientists of our country, among them the Academician Blagonravov, the first Chairman of the Readings’ Organization Committee.  9/19 is the 75th anniversary of the Tsiolkovsky Museum in Kaluga.  The ceremony dedicated to this anniversary will be held on 9/14 in conjunction with the activities related to the 46th Tsiolkovsky Scientific Readings.]  At ~10:40am, Mike Fossum powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 10:45am conducted a ham radio session with students at Pine Tree Middle School, Longview, TX.  At ~1:35pm, Mike conducted his regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists. At ~3:25pm, the crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3).      [Only 1.5h workout reported for FE-5 (ARED).  Mike Fossum is currently following a special experimental “SPRINT” protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5hrs per day regime and introduces special daily sessions.  No exercise will be timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Mike picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] A task listed for Andrey, Sergei & Sasha on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today continues to be the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). Before “Presleep” period tonight, Fossum turns on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Mike will turn MPC off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Sofia, Bulgaria (ISS had a nadir orbit over this capital city.  The crew was to try to acquire a context view.  Sofia lies in between wooded mountains in a wide treeless valley), Lisbon, Portugal (looking left for the great estuary of the Tagus River.  Greater Lisbon appears as the gray zone on either side of the estuary.  The city center lies at the narrow, coastal end of the estuary.  Bridges over the estuary may be visible), Kingston, Jamaica (ISS had a nadir orbit over this capital city on the south coast of the island.  There were most likely clouds present, but the crew still may have been able to capture this capital city), Hurricane Katia, Atlantic Ocean (Hurricane Katia is a Category 1 storm with sustained winds of 90 mph.  It is currently moving north at 14 mph.  It is projected to increase its forward speed as it curves to the NNW and moves away from the U.S.  The crew was to try for contextual views of the entire storm), Tropical Storm Nate, Bay of Campeche (Tropical Storm Nate currently has sustained winds of 50 mph and movement is southeast at 1 mph.  At the time of the orbital pass it was projected to have sustained winds of approximately 65 mph.  Computer models predict that the system will probably impact the northern Mexican coast or the southern Texas coast as a Category 1 Hurricane.  This assessment is still preliminary.  Looking towards the Bay of Campeche for a large mass of clouds, with some clouds extending towards Cuba and Florida), and Mississippi Delta Region, Gulf of Mexico (trying for imagery of the eastern Mississippi River delta and Chandeleur Islands. Overlapping mapping frames of the delta and islands were requested to assess the state of shorelines and vegetation).
