ISS On-Orbit Status 05/29/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-3 Joe Acaba had Day 2 of his first (FD15) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  After recording his diet input today, Joe will begin the urine collections for pH value on Thursday (5/31) and blood sampling on Friday (6/1).       [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15th day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 & 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.] Acaba also underwent his first session with the U.S. PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol as subject, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on BP (blood pressure) & ECG (electrocardiogram) during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with BP/ECG equipment and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.  Don Pettit assisted as Operator/CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  The BP/ECG recordings were later transferred from the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) via USB thumb drive to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for downlink to the ground.        [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.]  FE-5 Kuipers deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.      [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] FE-6 Pettit meanwhile conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Padalka, Revin & Acaba completed their first OOHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, a 30-minute NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures and monitor crew hearing status on-orbit, using a special software application on the SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop.    [The self-administered OOHA test is a variation of conventional audiometric testing, in which the crewmember determines minimum audibility for tones, over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, in each ear.  While wearing custom-made Prophonics earphones and Bose active noise reduction headsets, the crewmember uses special EarQ software on the SSC to determine the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The first on-orbit test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per 45 days thereafter.  Results are then reviewed by medical personnel and compared to pre-flight OOHA data and also to previous on-orbit OOHA results.  Note: There have been temporary shifts in hearing sensitivity documented on some crewmembers, most of which have recovered to pre-mission levels.] In the SM, Kononenko & Padalka continue the major outfitting activity with another 5 hrs of installing the new BPI NU (Low Frequency Data Receiver) and routing the required cable connections for the SUBA/Onboard Control System and SBI/Onboard Measurement System behind panels.      [The new system will enable the RS (Russian Segment) to send telemetry data through USOS (US Segment) assets.  Testing will begin after 6/6.] FE-6 Pettit started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware], As part of gathering medical samples in the ISS, Pettit used the GSCs (Grab Sample Containers) to collect air samples in the SM, Lab and Kibo JPM, sequenced with the AQM sampling for postflight comparison.      [GSC samples are taken 1-3 hrs after AQM start.] André sampled surface areas in Dragon, JPM and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) with the SSK (Surface Sample Kit), securing them in coldbag packages for return. Afterwards, FE-5 took an acoustic survey of the Dragon using the EHS SLM (Environmental Health System / Sound Level Meter).       [The survey involved six measurements in the capsule, taken at specific locations and an additional measurement in the Node-2/Dragon vestibule.]  Pettit performed the approximately weekly WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.      [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] In the ESA COL, with VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) adjusted for live coverage, Kuipers serviced the BLB (Biolab), opening the gas bottles and the N2 (nitrogen) valve for upcoming maintenance activities. Don, André & Joe spent more time on finishing up cargo transfer operations from and to the SpX Dragon capsule, going by an uplinked cargo list (“D”) and a choreography message, followed by a transfer tagup conference with ground personnel scheduled at ~3:10pm EDT.      [The crew had successfully completed all of the cargo operations yesterday, with some final medical samples, taken today, to be packed for return.  The Dragon hatch will be closed tomorrow, and Dragon will be unberthed early on 5/31 (Thursday).]  Later, Acaba (VV1/Visiting Vehicle-1) & Pettit (VV2) joined for a one-hour OBT (Onboard Training) proficiency session on SpX Dragon Departure, reviewing departure profile, Dragon release & departure crew procedures, and the crew interfaces for monitoring & commanding Dragon.     [The lesson walked Joe & Don through the steps in the departure procedures, with representative RWS (Robotic Workstation) and PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop screenshots for each step plus an overview of Dragon commands available to the crew via the CCP (Crew Command Panel).] Revin completed another 30-min. session for the DZZ-13 (Distantsionnoye zondirovaniye zemli/Remote Sensing of Earth-13) “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining SONY HDV-Z7E camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop. Afterwards, Sergei conducted the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] FE-2 also completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). The CDR took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Before sleeptime, Oleg will set up the battery of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment for overnight charging.      [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] Continuing the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Sergei first worked in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok) cleaning the grilles of interior panels 201, 301 & 401, then moving to the DC-1 Pirs Docking Compartment to replace its PF1 & PF2 dust filter cartridges and clean the V1, V2 & V3 fan grills and the VD1 & VD2 air ducts. Revin also performed the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of cooling loop KOB-2, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness). Don Pettit had another ~45 min for conducting the continuing preventive inspection & cleaning of accessible AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) system bacteria filters in Node-1, Node-2, Node-3, Airlock and Lab. Afterwards, FE-6 deactivated the NanoRacks Module 9 mixing tubes (2, 11). Joe Acaba closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & JAXA JPM windows in preparation for tonight’s SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) operations around the SpX Dragon capsule.      [Using the robotarm remotely, ground controllers will conduct an external 2-hr survey of the Dragon starting ~3:30pm EDT, followed by maneuvering the SSRMS/SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) to SPDM MBS PDGF-2 (Mobile Base System / Power & Data Grapple Fixture 2) and the SSRM then to the Dragon grapple position.  Four channels live TV downlink from external cameras in SD (Standard Definition) are required for all motion within 5ft of structure.] Before Presleep, Don relocates 16 Ice Bricks (+4 degC) and a DCB (Double Coldbag from yesterday’s temporary stowage to the Kibo JPM (Ice Bricks) and COL (DCB). Also before Presleep, FE-6 will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3 & FE-5 had their standard weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, André at ~5:40am, Oleg at ~1:00pm, Gennady at ~1:20pm, Joe at ~1:35pm, Sergei at ~2:30pm EDT. At ~4:10pm, the three Russian crewmembers are scheduled for a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking messages of greetings and congratulations to (1) the N. N. Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery which turns 80 on 6/1; (2) the Center for Testing & Deployment of Special Spacecraft which celebrates its 30th anniversary on 6/10 in Krasnoznamensk (Moscow Region); and (3) to Dr. Inessa. B. Kozlovskaya of IBMP whose birthday is on 6/2.      [The Burdenko Institute is one of the oldest neurosurgical clinics in Russia, darting back to 1932. Today the Institute is the largest clinic in the world helping patients suffering from central and peripheral nervous system disorders.--  Military personnel from the Center for Testing & Deployment of Special Spacecraft represent a team for implementation of ground control support loop, which is a part of the ISS RS Flight Control Management Team.--  Dr. Inessa Benediktovna Kozlovskaya, well known to all cosmonauts for her strict onboard workout protocols, is Doctor of Medical Science, Professor, correspondent member of Russian Academy of Science, distinguished scientist and a Laureate of State and RF Government Awards.] Before exercising on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), Don Pettit set up and checked out the G1 video camera in Node-3 for it to record his workout session and those of the other crewmembers on the machine (except FE-1), meeting the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.  Afterwards, the video footage was stowed by Oleg. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-1).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Tasks listed for Kononenko, Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop (Oleg+Gennady), andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb) (all). No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
