ISS On-Orbit Status 05/30/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   FD15 (Flight Day 15) of STS-134/Endeavour/ULF-6.   Underway:  Week 11 of Increment 27/28.  Crew complement: 3.   Memorial Day. ·        ISS crew sleep schedule:  Wake – 7:26pm last night; Sleep – 10:26am today (till 2:00am tomorrow, i.e., back to normal.) ISS and STS-134/Endeavour are flying in separate orbits again.     [After yesterday’s traditional Crew Photo event (3:11am EDT) and Crew Farewell at ~6:56am, covered by PAO TV, hatch closure was completed at ~7:51am, worked by Ron Garan on the ISS side and Mark Kelly & Box Johnson on the Shuttle side.  With the Shuttle controlling attitude of the mated stack with Orbiter ORB control, Mark & Box initiated the standard one-hour leak check on the ODS (Orbiter Docking System), then the crew went to sleep.  Endeavour undocked in darkness (local sunset 11:38pm) at 11:55:26pm from PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 2).  Sunrise: 12:14am.  PLT Johnson took Endeavour on the standard Flyaround at 400 ft (122 m).  The undock sequence then was unique due to the Shuttle STORRM DTO (Sensor Test for Orion Relative Navigation Risk Mitigation / Development Test Objective) whose data will be applied to the rendezvous/docking guidance & navigation of the future Orion capsule.  The STORRM sensors are mounted in two locations: VNSDC (Vision Navigation Sensor & Docking Camera) is mounted on the ODS truss, Star Tracker & DIC (Data Interface Controller) on an Orbiter sidewall carrier in the Payload Bay.  STORRM demonstrates and characterizes on-orbit performance of new navigation system technology.  Today’s data collection was unique in that Endeavour’s crew performed a series of burns specifically designed for a “re-rendezvous” approach to the ISS to test STORRM’s capabilities.  Data collection was monitored from Endeavour’s flight deck, and data were also sent to JSC for further analysis.  After the Orbiter reached 600 ft (183 m), ISS maneuvered to the usual +XVV TEA (+X-axis in Velocity Vector Torque Equilibrium Attitude) on Russian thruster control.  Attitude control was then handed over to U.S. CMGs (Control Moment Gyros) so that BGAs (Beta Gimbal Assemblies) could be rotated to improve energy balance.  Normally that would be the end of the attitude control timeline for undocking.  However, since the STORRM DTO requires a very precise attitude, control was handed back to thrusters at undock +~2h 50m which maneuvered the ISS to DTO attitude at 2:45am. The crew was then Go for PMA-2 Depress activities per the timeline.  ISS remained in attitude on thrusters until the DTO, at ~950 ft (290 m), was complete at ~4:25am.  At that point ISS rotated back to TEA, and attitude control authority was handed back to US CMG Momentum Management.  Final sep burn (Sep 3) was at ~8:39am, 1 fps retrograde.  Endeavour returns to Earth on 6/1 (Wednesday) after its 16-day mission.  First landing opportunity at KSC is at ~2:35am.  At that point, STS-134 will have chalked up a mission duration of 15d 17h 39m.] At wake-up, Garan undertook another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, his 15th.  [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Crew activities before & during undocking included –Ron Garan configuring the equipment for PMA-2 depressurization after the undocking,Borisenko & Garan setting up the departure configuration at the PMA-2 and standing by at the Lab RWS (Robotics Workstation) A31p laptop with a stopwatch to monitor the proper performance of automatic undocking software for the PMA-2 departure under Russian thruster attitude control and to immediately mode ISS to attitude control if undocking software fails  [the procedure provides for the crewmember to take over the automatic operational attitude control sequence manually if the software does not resume control after the period of free drift a few minutes after physical separation.  Free drift is employed to prevent a conflict between the control systems of the two vehicles (ISS & Shuttle) and to “limp” (unload) the docking mechanisms], andFE-3 using the NIKON digital camera and PD-100 camcorder to document the undocking, backing away & separation of the Atlantis. After the undocking, Ron –Depressed the PMA-2 and conducted the subsequent leak check (by periodically monitoring pressure readings) at the MPEV (Manual Pressure Equalization Valve),Took down the BPSMU (Battery Powered Speaker Microphone Unit) and its long single drag-through line, used during the docked phase, and stowed the equipment;Reconfigured the C&T (Command & Tracking) comm system in the RS (Russian Segment), setting it up for nominal operations, andRemoved the THC IMV (Temperature & Humidity Control Intermodule Ventilation) air duct in Node-2. CDR Borisenko verified proper operation of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM (Service Module) for taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle undocking.  Afterwards, Andrey downlinked the measurement data to the ground, then shut down the TEKh-15 equipment.     [Data calldown to TsUP/Moscow had to done once a day during joint flight of ULF-6 with the ISS, plus the file downlink and restart every third day.  IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.] Later, Andrey downloaded the structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.    [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] The CDR conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Andrey also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the periodic verification of the automatic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.       [After first scanning the FS (File Server) laptop, the virus database is usually transferred by flash-card to the non-network computers, which are then scanned one by one.   Background:  Regularly on Mondays, automatic virus definition file updates are verified on the RSS2, RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 network laptops, while the non-networked laptops RSE-Med & RSE1 are manually updated.  Antivirus scans are then started & monitored on RSS2 & RSE-Med.  Results of the scans on RSS1, RSK1-T61p, RSK2 & RSE1 are verified on Tuesdays.  Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] In the SM, Aleksandr also conducted an inspection of an RT-50-1M current regulator behind panels 126 & 127, unbundling BKS Onboard Cable Network jumpers and taking photo imagery of the installation location in order for the ground to assess the feasibility of demating & changing out the current regulator at a time ahead.  Shortly before sleeptime, Sasha also initiated battery charging for the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware.     [The FSS system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] Continuing the current round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Andrey cleaned “Group B” fan screens in the MRM1 module after taking documentary photography, while Sasha spent several hours in the DC1 Docking Compartment and MRM2 Poisk module cleaning V1 & V2 fan screens and VD1 & VD2 air ducts, then replacing PF1 & PF2 dust filter cartridges with fresh spares in both modules, after photo documenting screens & filters. Samokutyayev & Borisenko again had time reserved for shooting more “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7 #2 high-definition camcorder as part of the ongoing effort to create a photo & video documentary database on the flight of ISS-28 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] The ISS crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).
