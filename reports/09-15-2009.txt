ISS On-Orbit Status 09/15/09   All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Upon wakeup, FE-1 Barratt, FE-2 Stott, FE-4 Thirsk & FE-5 DeWinne continued their new week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy & Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Nicole��s first, logging data from their Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a week-long session.    [To monitor the crewmembers�� sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment��s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]   Nicole began her first ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session, assisted by Frank DeWinne as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) in preparing electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres.     [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Nicole started Part 2 of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ��120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.]   Mike Barratt undertook the PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on blood pressure (BP) and ECG during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with the BP/ECG (blood pressure/electrocardiograph) and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.   Bob Thirsk acted as Operator/CMO.    [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.]   Later, Frank de Winne became the Subject for the PFE protocol to obtain BP and ECG data during programmed CEVIS exercise.  Bob Thirsk acted as Operator/CMO.   CDR Padalka conducted a session with the Russian biomedical MBI-15 "Pilot-M"/NEURO signal response experiment after setting up the workplace and equipment.  Romanenko provided assistance.  It was Gennady��s fourth MBI-15 run.  Afterwards, the Pilot-M & Neurolab-2000M gear was disassembled and stowed away.    [MBI-15 requires a table, ankle restraint system, eyeball electrodes for an EOG (electrooculogram), and two hand controllers (RUO & RUD) for testing piloting skill in ��flying�� simulations on a laptop (RSK1) under stopwatch control, as well as for studying special features of the psychophysiologic response of cosmonauts to the effects of stress factors in flight.]   FE-2 Stott, FE-4 Thirsk & FE-5 De Winne completed a final training session using the ROBoT onboard trainer to hone their proficiency for the upcoming HTV1 capture & berthing using the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) scheduled for 9/17.   All crewmembers conducted a teleconference with ground personnel to go through an overview of the HTV mission timeline, prepared by the Flight Director Office (see below).   Also in preparation for HTV arrival, Thirsk reviewed the setup notes for the POC DOUG (Portable Onboard Computers Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) software covering HTV Install and EP (Exposed Pallet) Extract/ Insert Operations.     [HTV installation will be done with the SSRMS, EP ops with the Kibo RMS (Robotic Manipulator System).  DOUG is a frequently updated special application running on the MSS (Mobile Service System) RWS laptops that provides a graphical birdseye-view image of the external station configuration and the SSRMS arm, showing its real-time location and configuration on a laptop during its operation.]   Nicole Stott completed the standard OBT (Onboard Training) drill of ISS Integrated Emergency Equipment Location & Status, assisted by CDR Padalka and consulting with specialists at TsUP-Moscow, MCC-Houston, COL-CC/Oberpfaffenhofen and SSIPC/Tsukuba.    [Covering all station modules, objectives of the training were to (1) familiarize the FE-2 with the locations of hardware and positions of valves used in emergencies, (2) acquaint the FE-2 with the egress route to the Soyuz, and (3) review crew interactions in emergencies, including discussing Nicole��s roles plus lessons learned from the previous two Emergency OBT drills performed during Increment 20 (7/8/09 & 8/6/09.]   Bob Thirsk completed a checkout of and familiarization with the CMRS (Crew Medical Restraint System), working with Nicole (who had done this task yesterday with Frank De Winne).    [The board-like CMRS allows strapping down a patient on the board with a harness for medical attention by the CMO (crew medical officer) who is also provided with restraints around the device.  CMRS can be secured to the ISS structure within two minutes to provide a patient restraint surface for performing emergency medical procedures, such as during ACLS (advanced cardiac life support).  It can also be used to transport a patient between the station and the Orbiter middeck.  It isolates the crew and equipment electrically during defibrillations and pacing electrical discharges, accommodates the patient in the supine zero-G positions, provides cervical spine stabilization and, for a three-person crew, can also restrain two CMOs (crew medical officers) during their delivery of medical care.]     In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), the FE-4 also disconnected IPU (Image Processing Unit) user video cables between the MS FPEF (Marangoni Surface / Fluid Physics Experiment Facility) and the IPU, plus also the FPEF payload bus cable.   FE-3 Romanenko did the periodic inspection of the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor��s sediment trap insert.   [The Russian SRVK-2M converts collected condensate into drinking water and dispenses the reclaimed potable water].   CDR Padalka conducted the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWCs (Collapsible Water Containers, #1021, #1050) to the RS (Russian Segment) for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron��s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV will be connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO.     [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.]   In the U.S. Lab, Mike Barratt continued his setup work on the new MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2) rack, reconfiguring it from launch configuration to operational configuration.    [This included rearranging 1/4 and 1/2 Box Modules and removing extra Ice Bricks for stowage outside the rack, removing Velcro restraints on the box modules containing ice bricks plus desiccant/humidity cards contained in box modules.  All removed Velcro restraints and desiccant/humidity cards were placed in a Ziploc bag and trashed.]   For tomorrow��s scheduled major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) job of replacing the TVIS treadmill front right stabilizer spring, Mike gathered and prepared the large number of tools and devices needed, going by an uplinked stowage list.  Later tonight, after all TVIS exercise runs, the FE-2 will turn off the circuit breaker for the TVIS in the SM (Service Module).    [Power must be removed from TVIS for at least one hour prior to beginning the TVIS maintenance activity.]   After terminating battery charging for the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (��Mermaid��) experiment, Roman set up & initiated another observation session with the science hardware mounted on a bracket at SM window #9 (instead of handheld).    [RUSALKA ops involve calibration and tests of research equipment relating to the Sun and the Earth's limb at sunset (atmosphere lighted).  Being tested are the procedure for remote determination of Methane (CH4) & Carbon Dioxide (CO2) content in the atmosphere (in the First Phase), measurement of CH4 & CO2 content in the atmosphere and reception of data on NI2 and NI4 content over the territories subjected to natural and technogenic effects, reception of sufficient data on seasonal dependencies of tropospheric parameters being studied (in the Second Phase).  Equipment used:  Rusalka monoblock, Nikon D2X(s) digital photo camera; AF VR Nikkor ED 80-400f/4.5-5.6D lens with ultraviolet filter, bracket for attachment to the window, and Rusalka-Accessories set.  Support hardware: Device TIUS DKShG/PNSK, Laptop RSK1, and Software Package loading disk.]   The FE-3 also terminated the discharge/charge cycle on the first pair of three NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride) batteries for the Russian BMD (Biomedical Device) PZE STIMUL-01 payload in the payload��s charger device and initiated the process on the second pack.   [The neuromuscular myostimulator suit STIMUL-1, which uses electrical stimulation to contract and relax leg muscle fibers for conditioning, is part of the suite of BMS (Biomedical Support) systems under development at the Moscow IBMP (Institute for Biomedical Problems) for long-duration spaceflights including piloted Mars missions.]    Bob Thirsk conducted the standard sensor calibration and check on the CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1046 & #1063.   In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-5 De Winne supported ground ops by activating the PWS2 (Portable Workstation 2) laptop.   With the U.S. OGS (Oxygen Generator System) still inactive, conserving lifetime, the cabin atmosphere is periodically refreshed with O2 from Progress 34P stores.   Romanenko did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard ��delta file�� including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).   The CDR completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]   CDR, FE-3 & FE-4 had their periodic PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Roman at ~10:40am, Bob at ~2:50pm & Gennady at ~12:50am EDT.   At ~3:50pm, Bob Thirsk had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).   The crew performed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-2), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).    Afterwards, Frank transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).   At ~11:20am EDT, Gennady Padalka & Roman Romanenko downlinked a PAO TV message of greetings to the participants of the International Conference on Telemedicine and eHealth,��Anti-Crisis and Innovative Potentials of Telemedicine and eHealth��, to be held 9/21 in Moscow by the Russian Academy of Science.   At ~4:20pm, Mike Barratt will power up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at ~4:25pm conducted a ham radio session with students at Liberty Middle School, Camas, Washington USA.   CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Typhoon Choi-wan, Pacific Ocean (Dynamic Event. Typhoon Choi-wan is predicted to reach Category 4 strength by the time of your approach.  Looking to the right of track for the storm, well-defined cloud banding should evident; an eye may also have been visible), East Haruj Megafans, Libya (weather is predicted to be mostly clear over the central portion of this megafan site. Look for a continuous pattern of criss-crossing dry river channels as hallmarks of the megafan surfaces.  Overlapping mapping frames, taken along track, were requested), and High Central Andean Glaciers, S. America (ISS orbit track allowed for an opportunity to obtain oblique imagery of the southeast-trending portion of the Andean mountain chain and its glaciers.  Looking to the right and slightly behind the orbit track for views down the spine of the range).   CEO photography can be studied at this ��Gateway�� website: http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov  (as of 9/1/08, this database contained 770,668 views of the Earth from space, with 324,812 from the ISS alone).
