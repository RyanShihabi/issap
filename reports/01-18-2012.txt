01-18-2012January 18, 2012All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  After wakeup, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  FE-4 Kononenko conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system. The process will be terminated at ~4:15pm EST. Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow. [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 12/8 & 12/9).]  In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-6 Pettit turned on the PLT2 (Payload Laptop Terminal 2).  Later in the day, Pettit rebooted the PLT2 (Payload Laptop Terminal 2), then set and activated the MSPR AAA (Multi Purpose Small Payload Rack Avionics Air Assembly) fan from the PLT2 for a functional checkout.  In the evening, Dan Burbank will deactivate PLT2 again after JAXA ground ops.  Next, Pettit was to equip MERLIN-1 (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator 2) in Lab O4_B1 with two fresh desiccant packs, then transfer all food items and the tray assembly from MERLIN-2 (Lab O4_D1) to MERLIN-1. Later, he was to remove the old desiccant packs from MERLIN-2 and leave the front door open for a 24-hr dryout. [MERLIN is used for cold storage of crew food and drink.]  Don also undertook the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas. The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics. At the end, Don completed a self-assessment questionnaire. Answers were provided at test conclusion. [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk. To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training). The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.]  Anton Shkaplerov terminated overnight (10-hr) charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery for the Piren-V Pyro-endoscope, part of the Russian BAR science instruments suite (other BAR components being the ТТМ-2 Anemometer-Thermometer, the charger cable, and the video display unit).  Afterwards, Anton did the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways, of particular importance with a six-member crew on board. [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)�CRO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)�CRO, PkhO�CDC1, PkhO�CFGB PGO,PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO�CFGB GA, and FGB GA�CNode-1.]  CDR Burbank had ~2h 15m for the periodic microbial surface sample collection/incubation, using the Microbiology SSK (Surface Sampling Kit) to collect samples at selected sites in the Lab, Node-1, Node-2, Node-3, FGB, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and JPM.  FE-5 Kuipers collected samples of potable water from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient port, i.e., 250 mL in a bag for TOCA analysis, 1 Iodine in-flight sample (75 mL) and 125 mL in a bag for microbial in-flight analysis. [The latter samples were subsequently processed in the MCD (microbial capture device) and CDB (coliform detection bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection.]  FE-2 Ivanishin unstowed and set up the equipment required for the periodic Shumomer sound measurement operations in the SM for a functional checkout.  At ~3:50am, the entire crew held their first joint Fire Drill/OBT (on-board training), a mandatory periodic 55-min exercise (including post-training crew review). A 15-min ground debrief conference then followed at ~6:15am. [Primary goal of this Russian-led interactive exercise is to maintain crew skills in responding to a fire and to provide the station residents with the most realistic emergency training possible. The drill is always conducted with the support of all MCCs (TsUP-Moscow, TsUP-Kazakhstan, MCC-Houston, COL-CC, SSIPC/Tsukuba) in close coordination. It should be performed every 2.5 months, but not later than 1 month prior to end of Increment. OBT objectives are to (a) practice fire response procedures (FRPs) and all incorporated actions for the case of a software-detected fire to locate, extinguish, and verify extinguishing attempts; (b) browse through RS laptop and the Signal-VM fire detection system displays as well as the automated software (algorithms) response to the fire event; (c) practice crew communication necessary to perform emergency FRPs; (d) ensure familiarization with support equipment (CSA-CP compound specific analyzer-combustion products, PBAs portable breathing assemblies, PFE/OSP-4 portable fire extinguishers, and IPK-1M gas masks to be used for fire suppression). These exercises do not actually use any fire equipment but simulate such actions with comm channels, PBAs, CSA-CP and laptop displays to the maximum extent possible.]  André Kuipers reviewed the menu list for his upcoming 2 SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment sessions. 1stsession will be “low salt intake”, 2nd session “high salt intake”. [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each. From Day 1 to 5 (included), the crewmember is ingesting one of two special diets (low salt & high salt content). SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free. For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard. All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA. Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 & 6. Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA. 24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI. Background: SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight. The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions. Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved. However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased. Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]  EHS (Environmental Health System) and WRS (Water Recovery System) activities by André Kuipers included �C His first periodic (approx. weekly) WRS PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer) needle for microbial in-flight & post-flight analysis; [the in-flight samples were processed in the MCD (microbial capture device) and CDB (coliform detection bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection. After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged], The T+5 day visual microbial (bacterial & fungal) analysis & data recording of surface & air samples collected by him on 1/13 in Lab, SM, Node-1, Node-3 & Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) with the Microbiology SSK (Surface Sampling Kit) and MAS (Microbial Air Sampler); [the colony growth on the sampling slides is inspected visually after five days of incubation, using a special procedure to analyze the SSK media slides for bacterial & fungal colony growths], and Working on the WRS-2 in Node-3, removing the ARFTA #2 (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly 2), draining it into with the Russian Kompressor-M into an EDV-U container, performing a leak check, cleaning it and replacing it in WRS-2; [the recycle tank was then to be filled via the refill method using the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) quick-disconnect depress hose which was later removed again, along with the tank’s vent adapter.]  FE-2 Ivanishin worked in the DC1 Docking Compartment, starting the regular urine transfer from EDV-U containers (879, 983, 997, 998, 984, 881, 976) to the BV1 Rodnik water storage tank of Progress 45P (#413), docked at DC1, using the usual pumping equipment with the electric compressor (#41). The BV1 bladder was checked for leak-tightness on 1/13. The BV1 lines were then to be flushed. [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic. The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]  Later, Anatoly Later, Sergey prepared the RSS2 laptop for transmitting files to TsUP-Moscow via the Russian RSPI high-speed Radio Link Data Transmission System.  Anatoly & Anton both took the periodic Russian PZE-MO-3 test for physical fitness evaluation, Anatoly’s first, Anton’s 2nd, spending ~90 min on the TVIS treadmill in unmotorized (manual control) mode and wearing the Kardiokassette KK-2000 belt with three chest electrodes. [The fitness test, controlled from the RSE-Med laptop, yields ECG (electrocardiogram) readings to the KK-2000 data storage device, later downlinked via the Regul (BSR-TM) payload telemetry channel. Before the run, theKK-2000 was synchronized with the computer date/time readings. For the ECG, the crewmember rests for 5 min., then works out on the treadmill, first walking 3 min. up to 3.5 km/h, then running at a slow pace of 5-6 km/h for 2 min, at moderate pace of 6.5 km/h for 2 min, followed by the maximum pace not exceeding 10 km/h for 1 min, then walking again at gradually decreasing pace to 3.5 km/h].  Dan Burbank worked on fixing the failed ARED advanced resistive exercise device, as a last-minute addition to his timeline.[Ground engineers wanted him to insert an 11/32" deep socket into the jumping ratchet. This was tested on the ground and found to be the easiest and most efficient solution. The procedure included steps to install the socket, reassemble the crank handle and trigger assemblies, perform a cylinder evacuation, and then perform a checkout of the system at the end to make sure everything is working properly.]   Don Pettit powered off and relocated the EHS / TEPC (Environmental Health Systems / Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly from the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), loc. F2/3, to the SM Panel 327. [The TEPC detector assembly is the primary radiation measurement tool in the ISS.]  FE-6 also performed maintenance in the Kibo JPM, wiping the inside of insulation and the Luer-Lock Interface where ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) coolant leaked out on 1/11 before it was fixed. [Drying the wet insulation by keeping it separated for several days.]  The CDR also retrieved the 3 copies of the Warning Book from Lab, SM & FGB and incorporated P&I (Pen & Ink) changes to emergency procedures dealing with depressurization of the Soyuz spacecraft at MRM1 (DC1) and on SM aft (MRM2).  Shkaplerov completed the periodic cleaning of the screen of the BVN air heater fan assembly in the Orbital Module (BO) of the Soyuz TMA-22/28S (#232, docked at MRM2) spacecraft.  Anton also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).  Later, FE-1 performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM. [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]  FE-4 Kononenko had another 1.5 hrs for stowing trash and excessed equipment on Progress 45P, docked at DC1, for disposal. Afterwards, Oleg was to call down his report on “Stowage Complete” for the cargo ship-turned-trash can, to be undocked on 1/24.  Later, Oleg installed protective caps on cables at the hatch seal drive and switched the Progress cargo module (GrO) depressurization valve (KSD) to Electric Control. The installation was photo-documented. [This nonstandard steps are in preparation for the deployment of the Chibis-M MIKROSPUTNIK after Progress undocking.]  Kononenko also used the standard ECOSFERA equipment, broken out earlier for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 microbial experiment, setting it up to collect samples in Media 2 Petri dishes for cultivation, with the POTOK air filtration unit deactivated. Afterwards, Oleg recharged the experiment’s battery and then set up the equipment for more sampling tomorrow. [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies. Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge, the sample collection is being performed in two stages. After today‘s sampling, the ECOSFERA battery pack is being recharged overnight for tomorrow’s Stage 2 for sampling to more Petri dishes.]  The three Russian Flight Engineers spent several hours on an inventory/audit of the SM & FGB stowage areas, going by an extensive uplinked listing of IMS entries. The inventory included a search for a misplaced condensate collector.  In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-6 Pettit powered on the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) and VPC (Video Power Converter) hardware, connected VPC to HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1), and underwent his 2nd ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Resting Echo Scan in the US Lab, assisted by André Kuipers who served as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) to operate the USND scans. Pettit then transferred the data from the USND2 hard drive to the USND2 USB for subsequent downlink. [Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable & VOX, Don underwent the USND scan for ICV assessment, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera. Heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor). There are dietary constraints, and no exercise is allowed 4 hrs prior to scan. After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed. Later, the data from the two HM-2 (Holter Monitor 2) HiFi Cards and two Actiwatch Spectrums were downloaded. The USND echo experiment uses the Image Collector software on the laptop and requires VOX/Voice plus RT Video downlink during the activity. Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms. The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session. The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).]  Using the USND2 equipment, Pettit also conducted an ESA Vessel Imaging (Echography) ultrasound scan in the COL on the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop, his 2nd, using the Image Collector software, with VOX/Voice plus real-time video downlink during the activity. [Vascular Echography (Vessel Imaging) evaluates the changes in central and peripheral blood vessel wall properties (thickness and compliance) and cross sectional areas of long-duration ISS crewmembers during and after long-term exposure to microgravity. An LBNP (Lower Body Negative Pressure) program will be run in parallel to Vessel Imaging. Flow velocity changes in the aorta and the middle cerebral and femoral arteries will be used to quantify the cardiovascular response to fluid shift. Vessel Imaging aims to optimize the countermeasures used routinely during long-duration space missions.]  André unstowed & readied the urine pH kit for the Pro K protocol, for another session. [Under the Pro K protocol, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days. The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]  Pettit & Burbank has another time slot reserved for making entries in their electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer). [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]  Before Presleep, Dan Burbank will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link). After about an hour, Dan will turn MPC routing off again. [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]  CDR, FE-5 & FE-6 had their regular PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video. André at ~5:50 am, Dan at ~12:55pm, Don at ~2:10pm EST.  At ~12:10pm, Don Pettit responded to two interviews in a PAO TV downlink, one with KEX Radio (Paul Linnman), the other with KOIN-TV (Alexis Delcid & Chad Carter), both in Portland, OR.  At ~4:45am, André powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 4:50am conducted a ham radio session with students at the Vrije Technische Scholen (VTS), Sint-Niklaas, Belgium.   The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4).  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the Kerch Strait, Taman, Laganakskoe plateau, Krasnaya Polyana, the Kolka glacier, the river Terek, Galeras volcano, and Cleveland volcano A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).  Correction: The removal & packing for return of the ICS MUX (Inter-Satellite Communication System Data Multiplexer) from the ICS rack in Kibo lab, erroneously reported here yesterday, was deferred due to insufficient time for the involved activity.  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Vientiane, Laos (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE: ISS had a slightly oblique pass for this target in fair weather and early afternoon light with its approach from the NW. This capital city of about a quarter of a million is located on a large, south-turning bend in the Mekong River forming the Laotian-Thai border. At this time the crew was to look just left of track and try for contextual views that include the entire urban area), Lake Eyre, Australia (IR PHOTOGRAPHY COLLECTION SITE: This large, mostly dry lakebed is a landmark from space in South Australia. It is the lowest point of a basin that drains an area about one-seventh of the continent. This makes it a good indicator of long-term rainfall trends in east-central Australia. Nominal constraints of crew sleep make this a fairly rare target for ISS crews due to low light. At this time, as ISS approached the area from the NW in mid-afternoon light under partly cloudy skies, looking towards nadir for the lakebed with perhaps a darker flow of water from the north. Heavy rainfall in recent months has inundated much of the southern part of the lake. Trying for IR views in mapping fashion of the shoreline and recently vegetated areas in watercourses using the #99 filter), Bridgetown, Barbados (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE: Bridgetown is the capital and largest city of the island country of Barbados with the population of the metropolitan area at 96,578 (2006). ISS had a partly cloudy pass in early afternoon light. As it approached the island from the NW, looking towards nadir for this target. Barbados is the easternmost of the Lesser Antilles Archipelago. The city is located on the southwestern coast of the island along Carlisle Bay), Sian Kaan Bay Mangroves, Yucatan, MX (IR PHOTOGRAPHY COLLECTION SITE: ISS had an early afternoon pass in partly cloudy weather for this target area located on the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. This large World Heritage Site of ~1.3 million acres was established as a biosphere area in 1986, and preserves fauna, flora and archeological sites. As ISS tracked southeastward over the northeastern Yucatan, the crew was to shoot nadir for this area with its visual cues of two major bays on the Caribbean Sea. At this time, trying for mapping views of the darker vegetated areas using the IR filter #99), and Panama City, Panama (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE: This capital city of nearly 900,000 is located on the Pacific side of the Isthmus of Panama and just east side of the Panama Canal. ISS had a nadir pass in early afternoon with partly cloudy skies expected at the time. Trying to capture the entire urban area of the city within a single frame).
