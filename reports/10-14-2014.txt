Zebrafish Muscle: On Saturday Gerst performed a water exchange of Aquatic Habitat aquarium water and a water quality measurement.  Today he performed water maintenance, another water quality measurement and installed a cable to allow for troubleshooting of the Image Processing Unit (IPU).  This experiment asks if the atrophy of muscles under the condition of microgravity also occurs in zebrafish and why their atrophy occurs in the microgravity.
Rodent Research-1: On Sunday and Monday, the Crew performed the Rodent Research processing procedures and a fixative swap on the SPX-4 CASIS return samples.  Today, Wilmore performed an additional fixative swap.  The Rodent Research Hardware provides a platform aboard the International Space Station for long-duration rodent experiments in space. Such experiments will examine how microgravity affects the animals, providing information relevant to human spaceflight, discoveries in basic biology, and knowledge that will have direct impact toward human health on Earth. Rodent Research-1 is a test of the operational capabilities of the new hardware system, including the Transporter, Rodent Habitat, and Access Unit. 
Plant Gravity Sensing:  Today, Gerst removed samples from the +2 deg C Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) and move the -95 deg C MELFI in preparation for return on SPX-4.
Drug Metabolism: Gerst removed the Drug Metabolism Stow Bag from the Commercial Generic Biologic Apparatus-4 (CGBA-4) in preparation for return on SpaceX-4.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA)-28 Preparation:  The Crew finalized the configuration for the Equipment Lock, Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU), and ancillary hardware to support tomorrow’s EVA.  In addition, the Crew performed their last review of EVA-28 related procedures, including a follow-on conference with ground specialists.  Hatch opening is set to occur tomorrow morning at 7:25am CDT with ingress back into the Joint Airlock at approximately 1:20pm CDT.
