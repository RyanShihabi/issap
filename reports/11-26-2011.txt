ISS On-Orbit Status 11/26/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew rest day.   Godspeed Curiosity! After wakeup, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov & FE-2 Ivanishin joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.  Since this was the last scheduled round of Housekeeping for Exp-29, Mike & Satoshi paid special attention to some safeguarding issues to ensure a good configuration in the unlikely event of station decrewing (failure of 28S crew arriving): Flammable materials securely stowed away from UOPs (Utility Outlet Panels), Rack Power Outlets, and Power Strips, no loose items that could become free-floaters during nominal dynamic events, ventilation diffusers clear of stowage, and HEPA filters vacuum-cleaned.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton & Anatoly completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. The CDR conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Using the vacuum cleaner, Dan also performed the periodic cleaning of the vent grills of the OpsLAN Server SSC (Station Support Computer) T61p laptops in the Lab (loc. O1), to ensure optimal performance. After yesterday’s cable swap in the JAXA Kibo JPM on the Kobairo & Ryutai racks on, followed by ground checkouts using the new MMA (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus) cable, Burbank stowed the 5.50 m cable. Ivanishin completed the daily routine servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Burbank filled out his first weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Later, Dan had another time slot set aside for making entries in his electronic Journal on his personal SSC (Station Support Computer).       [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]  The CDR equipped MERLIN-2 (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator 2) in ER6 (EXPRESS Rack 6) with two fresh desiccant packs, then transferred all food items and the tray assembly from MERLIN-1 to MERLIN-2.  Next, he removed the old desiccant packs from MERLIN-1 and left the front door open for a 24-hr dryout.      [MERLIN is used for cold storage of crew food and drink.] Ivanishin set up and activated the Kenwood D700 ”Sputnik” amateur radio station in the SM, starting the program for the Russian KPT-14 SHADOW-BEACON (Tenj-Mayak) experiment, to run overnight using VHF radio-transmitted time-tagged radio beacon packets from the RS (Russia Segment) in automatic mode.  A number of deactivations/reactivations are scheduled tomorrow.       [Objective of the experiment is the automatic retranslation of time tag (pre-planned executable) packets from ground stations.  SHADOW (or ECLIPSE), sponsored by Roskosmos and its leading Moscow research organization TSNIIMASH (Central Research Institute of Machine Building), employs VHF amateur radio (ham) operators around the globe (via ARISS/Amateur Radio on ISS) to help in observing refraction/scattering effects in artificial plasmas using the method of RF (radio frequency) sounding in space experiments under different geophysical conditions.] At ~8:15am EST, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~10:15am, Anatoly & Anton supported a Russian PAO TV downlink, transmitting their greetings to four different events: (1) to “Around The World” magazine on its 150 year anniversary, (2) to the participants of the Russian Polar Sailboat Expedition, (3) to the citizens of Gagarin, and (4) on the commissioning of Stan-5000 Steel Complex (MKS) of the Objedinennaia Metallurgicheskaia Kompania (OMK) (United Steel Company) in the Nizhny Novgorod region with participation of Russian cosmonauts. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2) and ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2). Tasks listed for Shkaplerov & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for monitoring of the Gulf of Mexico, Fuego volcano in Guatemala, species survey of the Andes, Sangay volcano, Volcano Huascaran, Vulcan Cordon-Kaul, Vulcan Hudson, Viedma Glacier, Glacier Upsala, and Glacier Chico,A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-east Atlantic, South-East Pacific, and the south-west Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.

FSL (Fluid Science Laboratory, ESA):       Engineering assessment on the temperature fluctuation anomalies that occurred during the first set-points of the last GEOFLOW-2 science runs (11/7,) is on-going; the root cause has not yet been exactly identified. There are indications that quite high pump-consumption currents are linked to the observed temperature deviations. FWED (Flywheel Exercise Device, ESA):     No report. GENARA-A (Gravity Regulated Genes in Arabidopsis A/ESA):     No report. GEOFLOW-2 (ESA):      The science team agreed to the engineering recommendation, i.e. to restart the science runs at so-called high working environment. On 11/22 GEOFLOW-2 science runs were resumed starting with a no-rotation run (i15) at Tcold highest with initial delta-T at 9.8K and decreasing by steps of 0.4K. Real time images showed good quality and so far no temperature deviations have been observed.      [Background: Everybody is familiar with liquids. In an average day we get to use, handle or drink water or other liquids.  And everybody knows how fluids (that is liquids and gases) behave: when subjected to a net force, may be pressure, a temperature difference or gravity, they can move freely.  Scientists have been studying how fluids move for centuries, and managed to write mathematical formulas that can describe and predict such movements. Unfortunately, these equations are extremely complex and only approximate solutions are known. As a result, our quantitative understanding of fluid movement is just partial. This is especially true for natural phenomena where the forces can be enormous and unpredictable, like in oceans or in the atmosphere. Or the interior of the earth, where rocks are exposed to pressures and temperatures so incredibly high that they slowly move and adapt their shape. That is, over hundreds of years rocks flow just like a very viscous liquid. Scientists try to study such flows but cannot observe them directly due to the fact that they take place deep beneath the surface of our planet. The only way is to have computers simulating those movements starting from the equations, but how to check whether computers are correct? This is what Geoflow II is trying to answer on board the International Space Station. Geoflow II is a miniature planet that has some of its essential ingredients: a fluid can freely move inside a spherical container that rotates, has temperature differences and has a simulated gravity directed towards the centre just like in a real planet. By taking pictures of the fluid  movements, scientists are able to understand the essential characteristics of the flows and determine whether computer simulations are correct or whether they need to be refined and improved towards a better understanding of the elusive movements that take place inside our planet.] HAIR (JAXA):      No report.

SODI/COLLOID (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument/Colloid):       Further troubleshooting steps concentrated on the optimization of the image quality.  In order to reach image quality that is sufficient for science data return, a series of iteration steps were performed in week #09 and #10.  During these very short test runs camera exposure times, black level parameters and laser gain levels for the movable and fixed modules were adjusted.  Since any change of one of these settings directly influences the other parameters, images were acquired and downlinked after each iteration step in order to check for the impact of the parameters’ update.  The current settings for the red lasers result in good quality in terms of image contrast. However, the settings for the infrared laser still need to be optimized.  Recently downloaded images are under investigation.  The way forward is to perform phase stepping tests with the updated parameters to finalize the phase stepping algorithm settings for the final phase images.  Thereafter, a control step test intends to check for the final settings for all lasers and all sample cells before resuming science runs.

"Vessel Imaging" is using the Ultrasound scanner on  board the ISS to take images of the five different blood vessels in the lower abdomen and in the legs to study what changes  occur to cause the blood vessels to be less able to vasoconstrict. For each vessel, a 5 second scan is performed to observe  the blood vessel during several heart beats, followed by a scan where the ultrasound scan-head is tilted to allow a "cut through the blood vessel wall".  The same scans are also performed before flight, and these pre-flight images are used as the baseline  to which the in-flight data is compared with. The images are analyzed to detect any changes in the blood vessel wall properties, such as wall thickness, elasticity or structure, changes in the size of the blood vessel or blood flow (volume) while the crewmember is in orbit.] VIABLE  (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS Payload Touch, NASA):    No report.
