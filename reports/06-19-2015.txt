Ocular Health: Kelly and Kornienko completed their Flight Day (FD) 90 Ocular Health activities with their ultrasound session, Padalka was the ultrasound operator for both sessions. The ultrasound images will be used to identify changes in globe morphology, including flattening of the posterior globe, and document optic nerve sheath diameter, optic nerve sheath tortuosity, globe axial measurements, and choroidal engorgement. The Ocular Health protocol calls for a systematic gathering of physiological data to characterize the risk of microgravity-induced visual impairment/intracranial pressure in ISS crewmembers.
Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR) Lamp Replacement: To prepare for the Microchannel Diffusion Experiment (MDE), which is flying on SpaceX-7, Kelly replaced a burned out lamp in the FIR.
Spaceflight Effects on Neurocognitive Performance: Extent, Longevity, and Neural Bases (NeuroMapping):  Kelly completed his FD90 NeuroMapping sessions today.  A subset of behavioral assessment tests were performed to complement the pre- and post-flight testing, including a mental rotation test, dual task test, and a joystick-based sensorimotor adaptation test.  As a 1-year crewmember, Kelly will perform six in-flight NeuroMapping sessions throughout his mission.  NeuroMapping studies whether long-duration spaceflight causes changes to the brain, including brain structure and function, motor control, and multi-tasking abilities. It also measures how long it would take for the brain and body to recover from possible changes.
On Board Training (OBT) Robotics On Board Trainer (RoBOT): In preparation for SpX-7 arrival Kelly (M-1) and Padalka (M-2) completed their second SpX-7 training session using RoBOT. This session focused on introducing Padalka to SSRMS Hot Backup operations as well as SSRMS malfunction recovery during track and capture. Kelly also lead Padalka through the Free-Flyer Capture Cue Card as well as star blocks of the SSRMS capture procedure.
