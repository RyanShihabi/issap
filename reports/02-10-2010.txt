ISS On-Orbit Status 02/10/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sleep shift in effect:  The ISS crew’s workday began last evening at 4:14pm and ended this morning at 7:44 EST (see time table at bottom).   STS-130/Endeavour docked smoothly at the ISS PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter-2) port at ~12:57am EST this morning, late by ~51 min -- of which ~35 min delay was due to lost alignment during retraction, followed by regaining alignment (slowed by gravity gradient) before continuing retraction and hook drive (similar signature was seen on STS-126).  After successful completion of the RPM (R-Bar Pitch Maneuver), Endeavour had arrived at +V-Bar (310 ft straight in front of ISS) at few minutes later.  The station now hosts eleven occupants as Mission 20A is underway.     [The combined crew is comprised of ISS-CDR Jeff Williams (USA), FE-1 Maxim Suraev (Russia), FE-4 Oleg Kotov (Russia), FE-5 Soichi Noguchi (Japan), FE-6 TJ Creamer (USA), STS-CDR George Zamka, PLT Terry Virts, MS1 Kay Hire, MS2 Steve Robinson, MS3 Nicholas Patrick and MS4 Robert Behnken.]  Hook closure to rigidize the Shuttle-ISS linkup was at 12:57am.  After the docking, the station was reoriented as planned to minimize the risk of micrometeoroid/debris impacts upon the Shuttle (-XVV = -x-axis in velocity vector, +z-axis in local vertical).    [Earlier, at 10:18pm, the ISS maneuvered to docking attitude after attitude control authority was handed over from USOS (US Segment) to RS MCS (Russian Segment Motion Control System) at ~10:13pm.  Control returned to US Momentum Management at ~1:35am.]  Before the docking, FE-1 Suraev performed final STTS communications configuration checks for the docking.  Upon docking, Maxim switched USOS/RS comm systems to their mated-flight mode.  Other pre-docking preparations by the ISS crew included:  Williams & Suraev readying their RPM photo equipment, including camera battery checks, for Orbiter TPS (Thermal Protection System) documentation, Williams checking the proper hook-up of the UOP DCP (Utility Outlet Panel/Display & Control Panel) power bypass cable at the CUP RWS (Cupola Robotic Work Station) for video coverage of the Shuttle’s approach & docking with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) cameras,Noguchi preparing his photo/video equipment for documenting approach & docking activities, Powering up the PCS (Portable Computer System) CUP RWS & Airlock A31p laptops and swapping out tapes in the VDS VTR (Video Distribution Subsystem/Video Tape Recorder), Configuring & later activating the camera timers upon Orbiter RPM initiation and handling the camcorder (the timers indicate beginning & end of the bottom-side photography window), plus Configuring proper headset connection for supporting the RPM activity (which resulted in several hundred pictures of the Orbiter bottom TPS).   During the RPM photo session (10:54pm-11:09pm), Maxim wielded the 400mm-lens D2X camera (replacing the earlier DCS-760), Jeff the 800mm-lens D2X for documenting the tile acreage & bottom-side door seals).     [The RPM was used by the crew for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the two “shooters”, had only ~90 seconds (out of the total 9 min of imaging) for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Endeavour, which Jeff prepared for downlinking after completion of the “shoot” at ~12:30am for launch damage assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting was very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]  Shortly before the docking, FE-1 Suraev configured the Russian MCS (Motion Control System) for the automatic “PMA-2 Arrival” mode, an operational sequence used to monitor Orbiter arrival at the PMA-2.   [At “Capture Confirmed”, ISS attitude was immediately set to free drift for about 27 min. to allow dampening out relative motions of ISS and Endeavour (with the ODS (Orbiter Docking System) dampers/shock absorbers), then maneuvered to “Mated TEA” (Torque Equilibrium Attitude) to account for the new overall configuration with Endeavour docked.]  After leak checks of the ODS vestibule for about an hour, ISS/STS hatches were opened at 2:16am.    After hatch opening, before installation of the ventilation airduct between station and Endeavour, Kotov performed the standard collection of air samples with the Russian AK-1M sampler in the SM, FGB, Lab, and then also in the Orbiter.   After the traditional welcome ceremony (~2:04am), the new arrivals received the mandatory 25-min. Safety briefing.  At wake-up last evening, FE-4 Kotov began his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O2 generator.    [The filters were installed by Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Right after Postsleep, CDR Williams, FE-5 Noguchi & FE-6 Creamer completed another Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  A total of 121 RST runs are assigned to Jeff for the duration of his orbital stay.]  Williams & Creamer continued their new week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy & Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s second, donning their Actiwatches, from which to log data to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]  Kotov & Suraev each had two hours set aside for transferring Progress 36P-delivered cargo to the ISS, keeping track of their moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System) databases.  TJ Creamer set up the Integrated Immune Saliva supplies preparatory to upcoming collection sessions.  Preparations are ongoing for the EVA-1 spacewalk on 2/12, with campout by Behnken & Patrick scheduled for tomorrow.  FE-5 Noguchi tore down the WDS (Water Delivery System) in preparation for Regen (regeneration systems) work occurring over the next few days.    [Due to this, the crew has no water available from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser).  For the few days (FD3-FD5) that the crew requires water, it can be retrieved from the Russian segment SRVK.]  Other tasks underway or coming up on board:  Cargo transfers from the Orbiter to ISS, by Shuttle crewmembers, were 6% complete this morning,Installation of the new DA (Distillation Assembly), EFA (External Filter Assembly), FCPA (Fluids Control Pump Assembly) and new filters will commence tonight after wake-up.  The UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) and WPA (Water Processor Assembly) will then be brought to Standby around 11:30 pm EST.RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) fill will begin on FD5.OGA (Oxygen Generator Assembly) troubleshooting plan is targeted for FD6.   The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).   Sleep shifting started with the Progress docking on 2/4.  On 2/6, crew wake shifted earlier, to 5:40pm EST.  20A Undock will drive Crew Wake one and a half hours earlier to 4:09pm by FD12.  This shift is accomplished by moving Crew Sleep 30 min earlier on FDs 6-10, and then again on FD11 and FD12.
