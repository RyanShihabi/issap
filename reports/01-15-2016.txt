Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #35:  Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #35:  Peake and Kopra egressed the Airlock at 7am CST in order to perform EVA #35.  During the EVA, Kopra’s carbon dioxide (CO2) sensor failed and then later he noticed a water bubble in his helmet.  Based on the trend, the Flight Control Team decided to terminate the EVA.  The Phased Elapsed Time (PET) for today’s EVA was 04:43 hours with Crew Lock ingress taking place at 11:40 pm CST.  The objectives for the EVA are as follows:
Sequential Shunt Unit (SSU) 1B:  The new SSU was successfully checked out. Ground teams are in the process of configuring the 1B channel for normal operations.
·         Remove and Replace Sequential Shunt Unit (SSU) 1B – Completed 
·         Install Node 3 Non-Propulsive Vent (NPV) – Completed
·         Retrieve Camera Port 9 Light – Deferred
·         Route International Docking Adapter 3 Cables – Partially Completed
