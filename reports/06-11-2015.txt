41 Soyuz (41S) Undock/Landing:  41S undocked and landed today at approximately 8:44 CDT, bringing Terry Virts, Anton Shkaplerov and Samantha Cristoforetti back to Earth. The undock began 3-crew operations on the ISS until the arrival of 43S currently planned for late in July.
41S Return Sample Collections Transfer: Kelly collected saliva, buccal, urine, and blood for Twins Study, Biochemical Profile, CardioOx, Salivary Markers, and Microbiome.  Cristoforetti collected ambient collections for Microbiome and Salivary Markers.  The samples to be frozen were inserted into Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) for return on a future flight. The ambient samples were handed over to be packed in the Soyuz.  Additionally, Cristoforetti packed the Stem Cell Differentiation (SCD) samples from MELFI into the SCD Experiment Pouches and transferred them to Shkaplerov for final packing in the Soyuz.
