Cygnus NG-13 Launch Update: The NG-13 mission is currently scheduled for launch from NASA Wallops Launch Facility on Friday, February 14th at 2:43 pm CT. Cygnus is scheduled for ISS arrival and capture on Sunday, February 16th at 3:40 am CT.  Following capture and berthing to the Node 1 nadir port, the crew will ingress S.S. Robert Henry Lawrence Jr and begin the transfer of time critical payloads to the ISS. The NG-13 resupply mission is part of the Commercial Resupply Services-2 (CRS-2) contract.
Payloads:
Bartolomeo preparation: Today, the crew installed the Bartolomeo break out harness installation behind the Human Research Facility (HRF) 2 rack in the Columbus Module COL1A4 location. In order to access the harness installation area behind the rack, the crew cleared stowage from the HRF2 rack front, de-mated the rack service umbilicals, and rotated the rack down. Once the Bartolomeo breakout harness was installed the crew restored the HRF2 rack to its nominal configuration.
Designed to meet user requirements from the commercial and institutional sector, Bartolomeo will be a new external payload hosting facility on the ram side of Columbus that is mechanically attached to the ram-facing primary and secondary trunnions.  Bartolomeo offers 12 active payload sites and one passive site, and can accommodate payloads from 5 to 450 kg in mass.  The first investigation to use Bartolomeo is expected to be the Multi-Needle Langmuir Probe, an instrument from the University of Oslo and the Norwegian company Eidsvoll Electronics to measure ionospheric plasma densities.
Systems: 
Oxygen Generator System (OGS) Activated Carbon/Ion Exchange (ACTEX) Filter Remove and Replace (R&R): Today, the crew performed an activity to draw samples from the OGS Recirculation Loop and R&R of the ACTEX cartridge that provides continuous scrubbing of the OGS Recirculation Loop.
