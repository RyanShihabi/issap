3D Printing in Zero-G:  Wilmore completed a review of the 3D printing in Zero-G payload overview and procedures in preparation for next week’s scheduled activity.  The 3D printing in Zero–G technology demonstration experiment aims to validate extrusion-based additive manufacturing technology’s ability to function in a micro-gravity environment.
Seedling Growth-2 Experiment:  Wilmore performed the second of three data collection sessions for the Seedling Growth-2 experiment.  During this session Wilmore removed the Experiment Containers (ECs) from the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS), processed and photographed the samples and placed them in a Minus Eighty degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) for freezing and stowage until return on a later flight.  He then installed four ECs on EMCS Rotor A for the third experiment run. Seedling Growth-2 is the second part of the Seedling Growth Experiment series that uses the plant Arabidopsis thaliana to determine the effects of gravity on cellular signaling mechanisms of phototropism and to investigate cell growth and proliferation responses to light stimulation in microgravity conditions.
Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS) Backup Drive System (BDS) Reconfiguration:  Wilmore configured cables and performed a checkout of the JEMRMS BDS.  This checkout was performed as preparation for the SpaceX-5 mission, when the JEMRMS will be used to transfer external payloads.
Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustible Products (CSA-CP) Activation and Checkout:  Wilmore completed the final checkout and deployment of the 4 CSA-CPs that were delivered to the ISS on 40S.
