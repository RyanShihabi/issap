Double Cold Bag (DCB) Packing:  Virts and Kelly packed the +4 degrees Celsius (°C) DCB with conditioned Ice Bricks and samples from Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI)-2 and -32°C DCBs with Ice Bricks and frozen samples from MELFI-3.  The +4°C DCB will be returning with Cell Shape and Expression, CASIS PCG-3, Nematode Muscles, and NanoRacks Module-53 samples.  The -32°C DCB will be returning with frozen HRP samples.  Once packed, the DCBs were placed in Dragon prior to hatch closure.
SpaceX-6 Departure Preparations:  This morning, the crew completed final cargo loading. Later, they configured Dragon’s pressurized segment for departure and closed its hatch.  Once the Dragon hatch was closed, they configured the Node 2 vestibule by removing Air Revitalization System (ARS) and data jumpers then installed the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) Controller Panel Assemblies (CPAs). SpaceX-6 unberth activities are scheduled to start this evening at 11:30pm CDT and Dragon release at ~6:04am CDT Thursday morning utilizing the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).
Node 3 Forward 2 Stowage Removal:  In preparation for Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) relocation next week, Virts removed stowage from the Node 3 Forward location. PMM relocation from Node 1 nadir to Node 3 forward is planned for Wednesday, May 27th.
