Food Physiology: The crew performed the setup for Saliva collection in support of the Food Physiology study. The Integrated Impact of Diet on Human Immune Response, the Gut Microbiota, and Nutritional Status During Adaptation to Spaceflight (Food Physiology) experiment is designed to characterize the key effects of an enhanced spaceflight diet on immune function, the gut microbiome, and nutritional status indicators. These factors are interlinked, but diet is the only one that can be easily and meaningfully altered on Earth or during flight. This investigation aims to document the effect of dietary improvements on human physiology and the ability of those improvements to enhance adaptation to spaceflight.

US Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #68: Today, FE-11 Bob Behnken (EV1) and ISS CDR Chris Cassidy (EV2) completed US EVA #68 (S6 Battery EVA #4). Following a very successful EVA last week, the crew had minimal cleanup at the Integrated Equipment Assembly (IEA) during today’s EVA. This allowed the crew to perform the following tasks:

Robotic Tool Storage (RiTS) Installation
H-Fixture Removal (1A and 3B)
Nanoracks Airlock Preparation
Camera Port 3 (CP3) Ethernet Cable Routing
CP13 Ethernet Cable Routing & Camera Lens Filter Removal

The crew was able to remove the H-fixtures today utilizing a set of modified pliers. The crew deferred a similar task during EVA #2 when they encountered difficulty attempting to remove the H-fixture. Ground teams developed a workaround tool by modifying a set of damaged pliers scheduled for disposal on HTV9.
