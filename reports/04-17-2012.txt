ISS On-Orbit Status 04/17/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Before breakfast & exercise, FE-4 Kononenko & FE-5 Kuipers each completed a 10-min session with the periodic Russian MedOps test MO-10 "Hematokrit", which measures the red cell count of the blood, with one of them acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer, Russian: “Examiner”).  Oleg then stowed the equipment.  It was the 3rd session for both of them.       [The blood samples were drawn from a finger with a perforator lancet, then centrifuged in two microcapillary tubes in the M-1100 kit's minicentrifuge, and its Hematocrit value was read off the tubes with a magnifying glass.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.  After the exam, the data were saved in the IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).] After breakfast, Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Supporting POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center)/Huntsville on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), CDR Burbank uninstalled & removed the three protective alignment guides from the rack, re-engaged the snubber pins and locked the safety pins to allow the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be active before begin of ground-commanded CIR operations requiring a microgravity environment.  Dan also performed extended maintenance on all CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) units, replacing their batteries, performing the periodic zero calibration on their combustible products sensors and comparing their measurements.   In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Don Pettit performed his 3rd leg self scan as part of the SPRINT protocol he is currently on, with remote monitoring from the ground.     [After setting up the video camera for ground viewing and configuring the USND2 (Ultrasound 2) equipment, FE-6 placed reference markers on thigh and calf of his right leg and donned the SPRINT Thigh and Calf guides, assisted by André Kuipers, then performed the USND scan.]  In Node-3, FE-5 Kuipers completed the periodic water sample collection from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient & Hot ports for microbial inflight & TOCA analysis plus a post-flight sample for return on Soyuz 28S.       [From Ambient port: 75 mL iodine sample; from Hot port: 1 TOCA in-flight sample (250 mL), 1 post-flight sample (500 mL) & 1 microbial in-flight sample (125 mL).  The in-flight samples were subsequently processed in the MCD (Microbial Capture Device) and CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection.  After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Dan Burbank configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 5th (R-15d) and final session of the ESA ICV Alternate Ambulatory Monitoring assessment, assisted by Don Pettit in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres.  At ~8:50am EDT, the CDR observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.        [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] FE-1 Shkaplerov had most of his workday dedicated to the R&R (removal & replacement) of the fan box of the KhSA Cooler/Dehumidifier Assembly in the SA (Descent Module) of the TMA-22/28S spacecraft.      [Activity steps included temporary relocation of the KV2 Sokol intravehicular suits and two air duct sections from SA to the BO (Orbital Module), installing the BO air deflector with flow direction toward the SA-BO hatch, and swapping the old fan box with a new spare, before restoring the nominal SA ventilation configuration.]  FE-2 Ivanishin continued the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the SM for cleaning its numerous Group A ventilator fans & grilles. FE-4 Kononenko had ~3 hrs set aside to finish up loading Progress M-14M/46P with trash and discarded equipment for disposal. Later, Oleg & Anatoly installed the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the 46P cargo ship and the DC1, preparatory of the 4/19 undocking.      [The StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB and DC-1.] Oleg also performed periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), verifying proper function of the radiation detectors by taking readings from the LULIN-5 electronics box located in the MRM1 Rassvet module near the spherical “phantom”.       [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (dosimeters (A41, A42, A43, A44, A45, A46, A47, A48) are deployed in the RS.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.] Burbank retrieved & pre-gathered equipment & tools required for his IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the OGS (Oxygen Generation System) scheduled tomorrow.       [Task Objective: R&R of the OGS H2 (hydrogen) sensor, and cleaning of the rack AAA (Avionics Air Assembly).] Afterwards, the CDR & FE-5 had time reserved (Dan ~3 hrs, André ~2 hrs) for ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) cargo clean-up & unpack activities, guided by an uplinked list.  Later (~2:30pm), Dan will tag up with the ground for a status report.       [Activities focus on cleaning the USOS (US Orbit Segment) after the recent expedited ATV-3 transfer ops and unpacking cargo items into their final locations, with specified CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) and packing foam to be restowed for trash in ATV-3.] Working in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) on the FPEF (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility), FE-6 Pettit removed the experiment cover body and IR (Infrared) Imager, then performed a careful inspection of the state of the two mirrors (front & downward) in the FPEF which André had found to be dirty on 3/15.   Don then re-installed the IR Imager and cover.     [In order to clean up the mirrors appropriately, JAXA needs more detailed information and Don’s advice because the state of mirror was worse than ground specialists expected.] Also in the Kibo lab, André Kuipers used BZK wipes to clean out the insides of the Micro-G & 1G IUs (Incubator Units) of the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility.  Afterwards, FE-5 prepared the CDL HLTA BP (Cardiolab Holter Arterial Blood Pressure) kit for tomorrow’s scheduled CARD (Long Term Microgravity:  Model for Investigating Mechanisms of Heart Disease) experiment by inserting fresh AA batteries (minimum of 16 hrs before session start). In preparation for today’s ground-controlled SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) operations, André later connected the RWS DCP (Robotic Workstation Display & Control Panel) bypass cable in the Node-3/Cupola and then performed the regular pre-flight checkout on the RWS.       [SSRMS will be taken through offset grapple sessions on 4/18 ( tomorrow), 4/20 & 4/24 in preparation for SpaceX Dragon arrival.] Kononenko took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Ivanishin completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anatoly also completed his 12th data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] Afterwards FE-2 broke out and set up the equipment for another session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis, scheduled tomorrow for Anton, Oleg, André and himself.        [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s /special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).] FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 & FE-5 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, André at ~11:00am, Anatoly at ~11:30am, Oleg at ~1:45pm, Anton at ~2:30pm EDT. At ~1:00pm, CDR Burbank & FE-6 Pettit supported two PAO TV downlinks for later airing, with Dan first delivering a message recapping Expedition 30 and discussing Soyuz 28S landing, then Don offering his thoughts on the upcoming SpaceX Dragon operations (Fly-Under, Grapple & Berthing). Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime Burbank had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6).     [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Volcanoes, Sakura-Jima, Kirishima, Hudson, Aetna, Stromboli, Hierro & Popocatepetl, and the Patagonian glaciers Upsala, Viedma and Chico,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were New Delhi, India (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  ISS had a near-nadir pass for this target in late afternoon with its approach from the SW.  This capital city is actually one of nine districts the Indian megacity of Delhi and is located east of the center of the metropolis and west of the Yamuna River.  Trying for detailed mapping views of the New Delhi district.  The city is usually low-contrast and seasonal haze may make it difficult to see this target until one is are right on top of it), Libreville, Gabon (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  Libreville with its estimated population of nearly three quarters of a million is located on the extreme northwestern coast of Gabon.  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass with partly cloudy conditions expected.  At this time as it approached the African coast from the SW, the crew was to begin looking just right of track for this urban area on the north shore of the Gabon Estuary) and Georgetown, Guyana (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  ISS had a nadir-viewing for this capital city in fair weather with approach from the SW.  Georgetown with its population estimated at 250,000 is located near the Atlantic coast on the east bank of the Demerara River estuary.  At this time as ISS approached the coast and the small estuary of the Demerara, the crew was to try for detailed views of this small urban area).
