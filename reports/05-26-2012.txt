ISS On-Orbit Status 05/26/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew half-day off. Upon wakeup, FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 43rd for Don & André, the 3rd for Joe.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] After wakeup, Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. CDR Kononenko, FE-1 Padalka & FE-2 Revin joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg, Sergei & Gennady also completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM. Don Pettit started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware], Next, Pettit & Kuipers set up the Node-2 camcorder with MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and Firewire cable for Dragon hatch opening and powered down all CQ (Crew Quarters) laptops prior to removing power from the CQs for the Dragon ingress.  Afterwards, André & Don removed the CBM CPAs (Common Berthing Mechanism Controller Panel Assemblies) from the Node-2 nadir port and equalized the pressures between Dragon and ISS. At ~5:53am EDT, Dragon’s internal hatch was opened, and Don Pettit & Oleg Kononenko entered Dragon wearing protective masks and goggles to set up for IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) for 20 min before final ingress. Oleg sampled the atmosphere inside Dragon with the Russian AK-1M absorber, and Gennady retrieved the A-2 atmospheric scrubbing filter unit from MRM-1 stowage and set it up for operation in the FGB GA segment, with the inlet facing the PMA-1 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 1).  The unit will be deactivated before sleeptime. André unstowed SODF (Station Operation Data File) documents from Dragon, then deployed the new emergency procedures items in the ISS.      [Two books (EMER-2 & Warning Procedures) went into the US Lab and SM, and the EVA Systems checklist was stowed in the A/L (Airlock).] Afterwards, the six station occupants met for a 15-min Dragon Emergency Procedures OBT (On-board Training), reviewing the topics on an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop. FE-5 Kuipers completed Part 3 of the periodic acoustic measurement protocol, downloading the recorded data from the 3 acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) deployed yesterday for static measurements in the station to a T61p laptop, then stowing the recorders.      [Measurement locations: #1003 in ATV-3, #1004 in US Lab, #1005 in SM.] Sergei Revin performed standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in the MRM1 Rassvet, downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of Dragon berthing ops and hatch opening to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] In the Lab, Joe continued troubleshooting on the failed laptop of the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment at the WORF (Window Observational Research Facility).      [Steps included manually powering on laptop while on internal battery power, correcting BIOS settings, disconnecting/reconnecting the Firewire cable and checking circuit breaker status.  The failure was diagnosed as a corrupted BIOS.] Don used the vacuum cleaner to remove any dust & debris from the vents of the OpsLAN (Operations Local Area Network) Server T61p SSCs located in Lab bay O1 (LS1 & ISS-SERVER1) to ensure their optimal performance. After setting up the equipment, Joe Acaba performed his first (FD14/Flight Day 14) ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Resting Echo Scan in the US Lab, assisted by Don Pettit as Operator/CMO (Crew Medical Officer) to operate the USND (Ultrasound) scans.  Joe’s first Pro K controlled diet session begins on 5/28 (Monday).      [Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable & VOX, Joe underwent the USND scan for ICV assessment, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera.  Heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor).  There are dietary constraints, and no exercise is allowed 4 hrs prior to scan.  After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed.  Later, the data from the two HM-2 (Holter Monitor 2) HiFi Cards and two Actiwatch Spectrums were transferred from the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) hard drive to the USND-2 USB drive.  Voice required last 5 minutes for crew to inform ground copy process is complete.  The USND echo experiment uses the Image Collector software on the laptop and requires VOX/Voice plus RT Video downlink during the activity.  Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).] Acaba, Kuipers & Pettit filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Joe’s first, André’s 15th, Don’s 16th.        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Oleg completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~11:25am EDT, Pettit, Acaba & Kuipers supported a PAO TV event with U.S. media at JSC and via “telephone bridge”, focused mainly on the Dragon arrival and unloading. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (CDR, FE-2).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  Today’s exercise called for CEVIS (aerobic/interval), with ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic/continuous), T2 (aerobic/interval), ARED+T2, CEVIS (aerobic/interval) and T2 (aerobic/continuous) following in the next 5 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  ISS/ATV Reboost Update:  A one-burn reboost of the ISS with the ATV-3 OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters was performed last night at 8:10pm EDT with a burn duration of 6 min 17 sec, achieving a delta-V of 0.84 m/s (planned: 0.9 m/s), increasing mean altitude by 1.55 km (planned: 1.66 km).  After the burn, ISS was at 399.0 km mean altitude, with 407.5 km apogee height and 390.6 km perigee height.  The reboost was a slight underburn, ~7% less than expected delta-V and altitude gain.  Purpose of this reboost and a second one in June is to set up orbit phasing for Soyuz 29S landing (7/1). WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.    [The new card (31-0005E) lists 9 CWCs (89.9 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (no CWCs);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (4 CWCs with 75.9 L; and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-One – Week 3). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete.

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

The acquired data will be extremely valuable for the science team to be able to quantify the amount of Double Labelled Water that will be recycled in US system.”       [Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
