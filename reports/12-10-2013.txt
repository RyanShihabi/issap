Proximity Communications System (PROX) Checkout: Following yesterday’s successful checkout of PROX String “B”,  Flight Engineer (FE)–3 Hopkins worked with ground teams in order to checkout PROX String “A”.  Cygnus Launch Commit Criteria Flight Rules require verification of two fully functional ISS PROX equipment strings prior to launch.
Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Zero Robotics Test Session:  Hopkins and FE-5 Mastracchio tested several components to be used in the upcoming Zero Robotics High School tournament. They demonstrated game features and a full head-to-head match to assist students in preparing tests for the competition that will be held over the fall semester and winter break. SPHERES Zero Robotics provides high school students with the opportunity to act as ground controllers for research in space that utilizes the SPHERES satellites.  As part of the competition, students write algorithms for the SPHERES satellites to accomplish tasks relevant to future space missions. The algorithms are then tested by the SPHERES team and the best designs are selected for the competition to operate the SPHERES satellites on board the ISS.
Cosmo Shoot:  FE-6 Wakata set up the 4K camera and accessories in the Cupola and then checked the angle of view prior to the ground capturing images of the Lovejoy comet and other celestial events.  Following the imagery capture Wakata removed the hardware and temporarily stowed it in the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM).
Human Research Facility (HRF) Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device (SLAMMD) Body Measures:  Hopkins performed the first optional, crew requested body mass measurements.  SLAMMD provides body mass through the application of Newton’s Second Law of Motion (force is equal to mass times acceleration).  Two springs were used to generate a known force against a crewmember mounted on an extension arm and the resulting acceleration will be used to calculate his mass.
Inter Orbit Communication System (ICS) Comm. Check:  Wakata performed a JEM Space to Ground (S/G)-1 Comm Check with Tsukuba Space Center utilizing the newly repaired ICS.  Although the two way comm. check was successful at Tsukuba, MCC-H failed to hear Wakata’s voice on the downlink.  Teams are investigating ground equipment configuration. ICS provides an independent intercommunications network between the JEM and the Tsukuba Space Center, utilizing JAXA’s Data Relay Test Satellite (DRTS).
