SpaceX-16 Dragon Status: Early Sunday morning, the crew completed cargo loading into the Dragon vehicle in preparation for its departure. Later in the afternoon, they removed power connections, utility jumpers, and completed closeout of the Dragon vehicle prior to depressurization of the Node 2 Nadir vestibule. Robotics Ground Controllers then utilized the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to unberth Dragon then maneuver it to its release position. The crew monitored the ground controlled SSRMS release of Dragon at 5:33 PM CT. Dragon splashdown into the Pacific Ocean subsequently occurred at 11:10 PM CT. 
Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) imaging reconfiguration: Today the crew replaced a filter module and relay optics module.  This is part of the reconfiguration to support the upcoming Burning Rate Emulator (BRE) series of experiments. These reconfiguration activities are expected to continue over the next two to three weeks. The BRE experiment runs are focused on spacecraft fire prevention. More specifically, BRE’s objective is to improve our fundamental understanding of materials flammability and to assess the relevance of existing flammability test methods for low and partial-gravity environments. 
FIR/LMM/Biophysics-5 configuration: The crew configured the FIR/LMM (Fluids Integrated Rack/Light Microscopy Module/Light Microscopy Module) for the Biophysics-5 science runs. LMM/Biophyscs-5, more correctly known as Solution Convection and the Nucleation Precursors in Protein Crystallization, tests whether solution convection enhances or suppresses formation of the dense liquid clusters from which crystals form. This should help to determine why protein crystallization investigations in microgravity often generate unexpectedly low or high numbers of crystals.
Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Zero Robotics Dry Run: The crew performed the dry run in preparation for the 2018 High School Tournament currently planned for late January. The dry run is performed prior to the actual competition and allows the ground to verify various aspects of the competition are working as intended. During the actual completion later this month, the teams will be tasked with dodging virtual space debris in low Earth orbit to retrieve a damaged SPHERES satellite. The SPHERES-Zero-Robotics investigation establishes an opportunity for high school students to design research for the ISS. As part of a competition, students write algorithms for the SPHERES satellites to accomplish tasks relevant to future space missions. The algorithms are tested by the SPHERES team and the best designs are selected for the competition to operate the SPHERES satellites on board the ISS. 
Transition to (X2) R17 Software: Overnight, Flight Controllers started the R17 software transition by uplinking software files to Backup & Standby Command and Control (C&C) Multiplexer/Demultiplexers (MDMs) storage. Today, the crew gathered and installed Portable Computer System (PCS) R20 Hard Drives into deployed shells, while ground teams loaded BEP104 and R17 software to all three C&C MDMs,
New capabilities for X2_R17 software include:

PCS Texting
– Enables United States Crew Vehicle (USCV) and Soyuz crews to send 100-character (max) messages from their respective safe havens in the event of an emergency. MCC insight into texts and uplink capability will be available ~October 2019.


New Boot Software for C&C MDMs
– First time upgrading EPIC MDM Boot Software on-orbit


Longeron Shadowing counter checkpointed in C&C MDM
– Prevents a nuisance warning upon C&C transition for any array that had been shadowed at the time of the transition


Updates to InterFace Heat Exchanger (IFHX) Leak Responses to Columbus, Lab, and Node 3
– Closes Water On Off Valves in Columbus module and transitions Internal Thermal Control System to Dual (Lab and Node 3)


Other Improvements
– New Timeliner bundle will automate the commanding to radiation devices typically performed by the Biomedical Engineer (BME) console operator
– Command/Telemetry updates to support the Water Storage System (WSS)
