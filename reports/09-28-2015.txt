H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)-5 Departure:  This morning Yui and Lindgren finished closing out the Node 2 vestibule by demating all umbilicals to HTV-5.  Meanwhile, Kelly depressurized the vestibule between HTV-5 and Node 2 in preparation for the unberth. Commands were then sent to release Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) bolts prior to unberth.  Robotic Flight Controllers then maneuvered HTV-5 to the release position utilizing the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).  The first attempt to release HTV-5 at 10:20am CDT was aborted due to SSRMS Latching End Effector (LEE) B safing just as de-rigidization of the snare cables began.  Ground teams quickly recovered from the fault which allowed for Yui and Lindgren to release HTV-5 one revolution later at 11:53 am CDT.  HTV-5 is scheduled for destructive re-entry on Tuesday, September 29.
 
Fine Motor Skills Experiment:  Kelly completed a session of the Fine Motor Skills experiment.  During the experiment he performed a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet. This investigation is the first fine motor skills study to measure long-term microgravity exposure, different phases of microgravity adaptation, and sensorimotor recovery after returning to Earth gravity. The goal of Fine Motor Skills investigation is to identify trends or variations in fine motor performance in microgravity over the duration of a year-long space mission; how fine motor performance on orbit compares with that of a closely matched participant on Earth; and how performance changes before and after gravitational transitions, such as during early flight adaptation and after return to Earth.
 
Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU) Removal:  Yui replaced the MHU with JAXA’s Plant Gravity Sensing 2 (PGS2) in the CBEF inside the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG).  The PGS2 investigation supports the study of cellular formation of the gravity sensors and the molecular mechanism for gravity sensing in plants grown in microgravity conditions.
 
Multi-Purpose End-to-End Robotic Operations Network (METERON) SUPVIS-E Surveyor Rover Operations:  Using the ELIOS application running on the METERON-2 laptop in the ISS, Yui commanded the European Space Agency’s (ESA’s) Surveyor Rover located in Germany. He utilized video streams from the Lander, Surveyor Rover, and the Eurobot to perform a 360 degree inspection of the Eurobot. He also filled out and downlinked a questionnaire about the Surveyor Rover free driving. METERON examines the benefits of an astronaut controlling surface robots in real time from an orbiting spacecraft, and investigate how’s best to explore a planet through a human-robotic partnership.
 
Systems Operation Data File (SODF) Procedures Deploy:  Lindgren, updated Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems procedures within the US Airlock and In Flight Maintenance (IFM) Hatch Mechanism procedures within Russian Segment FGB module.  The new hardcopy procedures arrived onboard HTV-5.
 
External Wireless Instrumentation System (EWIS) Network Communication Unit (NCU) Troubleshooting and Remove and Replace (R&R):  The EWIS NCU, which allows for commanding and data retrieval from the EWIS sensors, had an anomaly on August 18th.  Today, Kelly configured an Station Support Computer (SSC) client to directly connect to a suspect EWIS NCU via serial interface prior to troubleshooting the EWIS NCU then deconfigured following execution of troubleshooting. Following this troubleshooting session to gather data, the NCU was replaced.  The new NCU is communicating on the network nominally.
 
Pre-Determined Debris Avoidance Maneuver (PDAM):  In order to avoid a conjunction with Object 40241, ISS performed a successful 0.3 m/s PDAM on Sunday using Progress 60P docked to Docking Compartment (DC)-1.   The PDAM did not impact HTV5 release today, and will not impact the 61P 4-orbit rendezvous scheduled for this Thursday, October 1st.
