ISS On-Orbit Status 11/05/11November 05, 2011
ISS On-Orbit Status 11/05/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty. After wakeup, FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. In the Lab, Fossum serviced the EarthKAM (EKAM/Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack, changing battery after wakeup.  Later in the day, Mike shut down the EKAM equipment, removed it to stowage and also returned the SSC-21 (Station Support Computer 21) T61p laptop to its original place in Node-2 (D5).  During this session, 8,830 participating students from 133 schools (111 US and 22 international) requested images via the web-based system managed at the University of California, San Diego.      [EK uses a NIKON D2Xs electronic still camera with 50mm and 180mm lenses, powered by a battery, taking pictures by remote operation from the ground, without crew interaction.  It is available for students who submit image requests and conduct geographic research.  The requests are uplinked in a camera control file to the T61p SSC-21 (Station Support Computer) laptop which then activates the camera at specified times and receives the digital images from the camera’s storage card on its hard drive, for subsequent downlink via OpsLAN.  The camera battery is changed when no pictures are being taken.  EKAM uses new software on SSC-21 which replaces the version used for the DCS 760 camera. This is the 3rd use of the D2Xs camera by EKAM.  Students around the world are delighted with the use of the higher resolution images.] The CDR also checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera & flashlight battery charge and again 8 hrs later at midday and before sleeptime.  The Nikon D2Xs camera with EarthKAM software running with the Intervalometer on SSC-18 is taking automated flash photography.       [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking one photo each hour of Sample 2 (since 11/2).  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.] Fossum, Furukawa & Volkov joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the Potok Air Purification System pre-filters in SM & FGB.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. In early preparation for his return to gravity on 11/8, Sergey Volkov underwent his first preliminary Chibis ODNT exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the T2 treadmill, with Satoshi Furukawa assisting him as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  For the 55-min exercise, monitored from the ground via telemetry (6:13am EDT), Sergey wore the GAMMA-1 system and the REG ShKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap.      [ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system after his long-term stay in zero-G.  The preparatory training consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -15, -20, -25, -30 mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] Later, the Russian Flight Engineer unpacked & deployed new 45P-arrived RODF (Russian Operations Data Files) documents.      [This involved updates for the books/material on Medical Operations (MO Books 1 & 2), Technical Experiments (TE), Geophysics (GF), Biotechnology (BTKh), PHOTO, TORU, Video & Audio (ViA), Manual Controls (RSU), Onboard Computer System (BVS), Guidance, Navigation and Control System (SUDN), Life Support System (SOZh), Atmosphere Revitalization System (SOGS), Pressure Control & Atmosphere Monitoring System (SKDS), FGB IFM IVA (PTO VnuKD), Transfer Ops (RPR), Progress 413 Transfer Ops (RPR TKG 413), plus the DVD with the video on “Deployment of jettison container with Chibis-M microsatellite”]. At ~8:45am EDT, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-4, FE-5). Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the Laganakskoe plateau, Krasnaya Polyana, Kolka Glacier, Volga River delta, the Caspian Sea, Mount Etna, Allalin Glacier, Ugra National Park, Volcano Huascaran, Darwin Island, and the Volcanoes Arenal, Poas and San Cristobal (monitoring possible activity),Conducting the daily inspection of the running Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.

BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):     “Thank you for working the problem with overexposure.  The later photographs (the ones not overexposed, i.e., washed-out) enabled our scientists to image enhance them and judge that the colloid density seems to be much higher next to the container wall for sample 1; so this sample will likely need to be remixed and rerun in the future before we will see phase separation kinetics.  The P&G phase separation samples (1 and 2) are "better" index matched than the Harvard phase separation samples, so there will be less contrast when the little blobs start to form and grow over time.  We have yet to receive your test data or sample pictures for sample 2.  Thank you for your efforts here.  We heard a "Yipee" from our P&G scientists when they were told that you had initiated sample 2.”   [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, that is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     On 11/3 the ground-commanded BIOLAB Rotor A and B alignment test was nominally performed.

GEOFLOW-2 (ESA):      GEOFLOW-2 science runs will be resumed from the ground by Monday, 11/7.   [Background: Everybody is familiar with liquids. In an average day we get to use, handle or drink water or other liquids.  And everybody knows how fluids (that is liquids and gases) behave: when subjected to a net force, may be pressure, a temperature difference or gravity, they can move freely.  Scientists have been studying how fluids move for centuries, and managed to write mathematical formulas that can describe and predict such movements. Unfortunately, these equations are extremely complex and only approximate solutions are known. As a result, our quantitative understanding of fluid movement is just partial. This is especially true for natural phenomena where the forces can be enormous and unpredictable, like in oceans or in the atmosphere. Or the interior of the earth, where rocks are exposed to pressures and temperatures so incredibly high that they slowly move and adapt their shape. That is, over hundreds of years rocks flow just like a very viscous liquid. Scientists try to study such flows but cannot observe them directly due to the fact that they take place deep beneath the surface of our planet. The only way is to have computers simulating those movements starting from the equations, but how to check whether computers are correct? This is  what GeoFlow II is trying to answer on board the International Space Station. GeoFlow II is a miniature planet that has some of its essential ingredients: a fluid can freely move inside a spherical container that rotates, has temperature differences and has a simulated gravity directed towards the centre just like in a real planet. By taking pictures of the fluid  movements, scientists are able to understand the essential characteristics of the flows and determine whether computer simulations are correct or whether they need to be refined and improved towards a better understanding of the elusive movements that take place inside our planet.] HAIR (JAXA):      On 10/28, Mike and Satoshi completed their 2nd and last sample collection and MELFI insertion.    [Hair root cells actively divide in a hair follicle, and they sensitively reflect physical conditions.  The hair shaft has an advantage in that it records the metabolic conditions of the environment where the subject is.  The purpose of this experiment is to examine the effect of long duration space flight on gene expression and trace element metabolism in human body by analysing human hair.] HDTV System (JAXA):   No report.

This includes a total of 112 events in 2011 and 678 total events for the project. ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera, NASA):    After careful examination of the on-orbit photos, it was noticed that the EarthKAM cable is still within the ISSAC pointing system range of motion (±30 deg) and it is highly likely to cause the physical obstruction again to our pointing motion.  Therefore, ISSAC stood down from its nominal operations this week until EarthKAM complete its science.  ISSAC will resume its operations next week on 11/7.  The impact to our science due to this temporary power down is minimal and acceptable and the lost science is recoverable next week.

SODI/IVIDIL (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument/Influence of Vibration on Diffusion in Liquids, ESA):    No report. SODI/COLLOID (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument/Colloid):     By 10/28, all “Crystal growth detection runs” were completed for all cells (4, 3, 2, 1). The correct temperature setting to create crystals is rather difficult to define as this process is very temperature sensitive and even a small temperature change can have the desired effect. However, the preliminary analyses of the science data indicate the formation of crystal-like structures for some of the cells. To check for any potential change in the current aggregation temperature (compared to the aggregation temperature determined at the beginning of the COLLOID#2 experiment), a new series of “reproducibility check runs” (#5-#8) was started on 10/28 and completed on 11/2.  The preliminary analyses of the data indicate that heating of the samples in between the two series of COLLOID#2 “reproducibility check runs” apparently has an effect on the aggregation process. The final COLLOID#2 runs, the so-called “demixing runs”, were completed for all COLLOID cells by 11/3.  At the time of writing, the “demixing run” for the reference cell is on-going.  During the “demixing runs” temperatures above the critical point are applied to the experimental cells. This might lead to an irreversible transition (i.e. phase separation) in the samples. All in all, we had a very smooth and successful COLLOID-2 experiment! SOLAR (Solar Monitoring Observatory, ESA):        Troubleshooting activities to recover from the Sun tracking anomaly that occurred last week (10/25) were successfully completed on 10/28.  Thereafter, SOLSPEC Sun tracking measurements were resumed and SOLSPEC calibrations were done without any issue by 10/31 when Sun Visibility Window #46 ended.  SolACES was in warmed-up configuration for the 42P undock event.  After 10/30 the Sun tracking measurement was no longer impacted by the shadowing of a robotic arm in parking position (was the case since 10/23) and was back to its full Sun tracking duration.

"Vessel Imaging" is using the Ultrasound scanner on board the ISS to take images of the five different blood vessels in the lower abdomen and in the legs to study what changes occur to cause the blood vessels to be less able to vasoconstrict.  For each vessel, a 5 second scan is performed to observe the blood vessel during several heart beats, followed by a scan where the ultrasound scan-head is tilted to allow a "cut through the blood vessel wall".  The same scans are also performed before flight, and these pre-flight images are used as the baseline to which the in-flight data is compared with.  The images are analyzed to detect any changes in the blood vessel wall properties, such as wall thickness, elasticity or structure, changes in the size of the blood vessel or blood flow (volume) while the crewmember is in orbit.] VIABLE  (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS Payload Touch, NASA):    No report. VO2max (NASA):    “Mike, congrats on completing the inflight portion of the VO2max experiment! We have really enjoyed working with you on-orbit.  Data analysis for this session will begin soon.

CEO (Crew Earth Observation):      Through 11/1, the ground has received 26,504 CEO frames for review and cataloging.  “We are pleased to report your acquisition of imagery this week with times corresponding to those of our CEO Daily Target Lists for the following targets:  Chihuahuan & Big Bend Deserts, TX and NM – target area acquired – under review and evaluation for content; Hurricane Rina, Caribbean Sea – excellent documentary views were acquired; Dakar, Senegal – several frames of this target were acquired with the 80mm lens setting – there was considerably more dust in the atmosphere than we anticipated – we will continue to request this target with the 180mm lens setting; Santiago, Chile – good imagery acquired of this target – imagery requirements are met and we can remove this from our list;  Popocatepetl Volcano, Mexico – good 400mm imagery was acquired – under review and evaluation for content;  Ganges River Delta – good imagery acquired – seasonal requirements for this target have been met; Pretoria, South Africa – under review for content; Johannesburg, South Africa – under review for content; Asmara, Eritrea – under review for content; India-Arabian Sea smog mass – under review for content; and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso – as promised, you “nailed it” – we can finally take this toughie off our list as well.  Thank you for your overwhelmingly good response to our target requests this past week!  Your striking view of Crepuscular Rays from above the subcontinent of India was published on NASA/GSFC’s Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  Your near-sunset view of shafts of sunlight (rays) being projected into a layer of haze behind cloud towers clearly illustrates the true parallel nature of the crepuscular rays.  Kudos for this heads up shot!” CEO targets uplinked for today were Chisinau, Moldova (World Capitals Collection Site:  ISS had a nadir pass at midday in clear weather over this target.  The Moldovan capital is located near the center of the country and inland about 120 miles from the northwestern coast of the Black Sea.  At this time, as ISS approached from the SW, the crew was to look for this urban area of nearly one million inhabitants), Managua, Nicaragua (World Capitals Collection Site:  On this mid-morning pass ISS approached the coast of Nicaragua from the SW in partly cloudy weather.  After crossing the coast the crew saw both the larger Lake Nicaragua to their right and the smaller Lake Managua to the NW.  Looking just left of track for this capital city of nearly 2 million located on the south shore of Lake Managua), Central Cuba (ongoing research at Florida International University is seeking imagery to document and analyze land cover change in central Cuba.  Today ISS had a nadir, fair-weather pass in mid-morning light over this target area.  As it approached the south coast of Cuba from the SW, the crew was to attempt a mapping strip of overlapping imagery just inland along the coast from the Zapata Peninsula to the Gulf of Ana Maria), and Volcan Colima, Mexico (ISS had a nadir pass in mid-morning light with fair expected weather over this massive, 3,850-meter volcanic complex in southwestern Mexico.  CEO staff has numerous photos of this target, but cloud-free, long-lens views of the twin-peaked summit area have eluded crews to date.  As ISS tracked northeastward over the coast of southern Mexico at this time, the crew was to look for this target and use the long lens).
