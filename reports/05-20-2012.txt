ISS On-Orbit Status 05/20/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Crew off duty.  Ahead:  Week 4 of Increment 31 (six-person crew).    After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  On ground recommendations Oleg also completed the routine daily & weekly servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.     [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings of SM & FGB for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers as required.] FE-6 Pettit sequentially initiated and monitored charging of four Makita batteries for use with the Cardiopres by FE-3 Acaba during Joe’s first session tomorrow with the 24-hr ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring experiment.      [Cardiopres continuously monitors blood pressure for 24 hours and is then doffed while the experiment continues for another 24 hrs with ECG (electrocardiogram) recording by the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) plus two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels.] FE-1 Padalka supported Russian science activities by retrieving the BTKh-26 KASKAD biotechnology payload in its bioreactor with tube & syringe, and the BIO-8 PLAZMIDA biology experiment in its Rekomb-K container from the Kryogem-03 cooler (+4 degC) and inserting them into the TBU (Universal Bioengineering Thermostat) temperature-controlled incubator, also set to +4 degC, then deactivating the Kryogem-03. FE-3 Acaba completed his (currently) daily task of filling out his ESA SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire.        [He started this activity after his Soyuz launch and is continuing it on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer), currently with daily logging in the first week, thereafter once weekly.  Neurologists from Leiden University are studying the question whether astronauts in space suffer from headaches.  With the help of a simple questionnaire, Joe registers the headache episodes and the eventual accompanying symptoms.  The results may help to characterize the frequency and characteristics of space headache and to develop countermeasure to prevent/minimize headache occurrence during the space flight.] At ~11:20am EDT, Oleg, Gennady & Sergei joined up for a Russian PAO TV downlink, extending messages of greetings to (1) the Scientific Research Institute of Precision Instrumentation on its 60th Anniversary, (2) the participants of the 7th Philanthropist International Prize Award Ceremony, (3) the Vladimir Branch of the Academy of Economics and Public Service under the RF President, and (4) the Moscow Planetarium.       [The Scientific Research Institute of Precision Instrumentation is turning 60 on 5/24.  As developer of the Igla and Kurs rendezvous & docking systems and command radio link hardware the Institute has made sizable contributions to Russia’s manned space program.--  The VII Philanthropist International Prize Award Ceremony to honor outstanding achievements by disabled persons in art and culture will open on 5/26 this year which has been declared the Year of Russian Culture.  The award panel is chaired by Iosif Kobson, the USSR Honored Artist.--  The Vladimir Branch of the Russia’s Academy of Economics & Public Service under the Russian Federation President in the City of Vladimir (Vladimir Region) turns 20. (“The 5 years of cooperation between the GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) and Vladimir Branch of the Russia’s Academy of Economics & Public Service have seen meetings with pilot-cosmonauts, public lectures about manned space exploration, space tourism, presentations of photographs by Sergey Krikalev and Valery Korzun.  Your Academy assists in promoting education among high school and college students and young people in general”.)--  In the next few days the Moscow Planetarium, promoting the achievements of national cosmonautics and patriotic education of young people, is expecting to see its millionth visitor.] CDR, FE-2, FE-3 & FE-5 have their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) scheduled today, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sergei at ~7:15am, Oleg at ~8:25am, André at ~9:30am, Joe at ~4:15pm EDT. The “old” crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (CDR).  Plus: Padalka & Revin did their first exercise (abbreviated) aboard ISS, FE-1 on VELO, FE-2 on TVIS.       [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day. Today’s exercise called for CEVIS (aerobic/interval), with ARED+T2 (Kinematics), T2 (aerobic/interval), ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic)) and CEVIS (interval) following in the next 4 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Tasks listed for the Russian crewmembers on their discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        Padalka taking NIKON D2X photographs of a flight suit (coveralls) behind the right seat head rest in the Soyuz 30S SA/Descent Module;·        A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Western Indian Ocean, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop(Kononenko),·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop (Kononenko), and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb) (all). No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
