ISS On-Orbit Status 03/13/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Upon wakeup, CDR Dan Burbank, FE-5 André Kuipers & FE-6 Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 35th for Dan, the 29th for André & Don.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] After breakfast, FE-1 Anton Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-4 Oleg Kononenko conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~5:15pm EDT.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 2/23 & 2/24).] FE-2 Anatoly Ivanishin completed the routine verification of yesterday’s automated refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.         [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the installation on 8/8/11 of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] For his on-going 3rd (FD75) Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Alternate experiment, FE-5 Kuipers reached midpoint at about 11:15am, after which André began the second 24h data collection period.      [For the second 24 hr period, the Cardiopres was temporarily doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery were changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).  (ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.)] After verifying LTL (Low Temperature Loop) flow in the US A/L (Airlock) for cooling, CDR Burbank undertook regular maintenance work on EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) equipment, today on EMUs #3010 and #3011: first filling their feed water tanks, then configuring the spacesuits for the periodic loop scrub.  This required setting them up with their SCUs (Service & Cooling Umbilicals) and initiating the standard one-hour scrubbing process on the EMU’s & A/L’s cooling water loops, filtering ionic and particulate matter (via a 3-micron filter).  Then the cooling loops were reconfigured and the ~2hr biocide (iodination) filtering initiated.  After their power-up, Dan also performed comm checks on the suits with André assisting, both EMU-to-EMU and EMU-to IV (Intravehicular {station}).       [The activity met the periodic maintenance requirements of the EMUs; no checkout steps were required.  Loop scrubbing, incl. iodination of the LCVGs (Liquid Cooling & Ventilation Garments) for biocidal maintenance, is done to eliminate any biomass and particulate matter that may have accumulated in the loops.] Early in the morning, Shkaplerov ran a test of the VHF1 (UKV1) channel of the Russian STTS communication system in the SM. After yesterday’s equipment preparations, Ivanishin & Kononenko today began the periodic inspection of surface conditions of structural elements inside the SM.  The evaluation focused on selected plates of the Resurs sensor system inside the SM, by measuring electrical conductivity using the MVP-2K device (done last: October 2011).  Ivanishin later downlinked the measurement data.     [Resurs measuring locations are on the spherical shell of the PrK Transfer Tunnel, on the shell of the PkhO Transfer Compartment and on the inside shells of Zvezda’s RO-1 & RO-2 (large & small diameter) sections.] In Node-3, to support subsequent UMS (Urine Monitoring System) activities, Kuipers set up the camcorder for video recording operations, configured the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) for internal EDV-U container use and closed the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) T-valve.  However, the originally scheduled UMS assembly & testing activities were cancelled/deferred, and André then reconfigured WHC to work with the UPA and opened the pre-treat T-valve. FE-6 Pettit had several hours set aside for more testing activities of Robonaut, covered by cabin video for ground monitoring in near real-time from Node-2.  Don installed a heat sink in both forearms of the manikin, and the ground then took over to put Robonaut in its Ready Pose and run sign language scripts for Robonaut’s arms, hands and fingers.  At the end, Pettit and Robonaut shook hands.      [After fixing a loose connector of the motion stop function, Don installed Robonaut and supporting hardware at the Lab P2 seat track location, made the necessary cable connections, powered on the hardware, activated Robonaut GUI (Graphic User Interface) and telnet windows and verified configuration readiness for ground take-over.  Later, FE-6 held the Motion Stop while the ground executed the script to bring Robonaut to Stow Pose, and subsequently disassembled the equipment.  Note: Robonaut powered operations should not exceed 5 hrs due to a touch temperature constraint.] After charging its battery in the morning, Shkaplerov & Ivanishin continued their work with the KPT-2 payload and its BAR science instruments suite, today in the SM for ~2 hrs (yesterday’s work was in the FGB).  Using the Piren-V and Iva-6A instruments, Anton & Anatoly collected air temperature & humidity measurements behind panels and then took temperature readings of surface locations on the pressurized shell.  Before sleeptime, Anton will terminate the recharge of the TTM-2 battery (after ~5 hrs).      [Problem area monitoring is necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data were copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities were supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] FE-4 Kononenko conducted a functionality test of the hardware and MPEG2 Video Server 2 software for transmitting streaming video via Ku-band to TsUP-Moscow, supported by ground specialist tagup via S-band.       [Since network video streaming slows down applications on laptops connected to WAPs (Wireless Access Points), the CDR beforehand switched any used wireless SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops temporarily to wired SSCs and later restored them to nominal.]  After yesterday’s installation of a new KVD Pressure Equalization Valve (PEV) #109 in the hatch between the FGB’s PGO Instrumentation & Cargo Compartment (priborno gruzovoj otsek) and the SM by FE-4, Kononenko & Shkaplerov prepared the hatch worksite for a leak check, scheduled tomorrow. Starting a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Shkaplerov worked in the MRM2 Poisk module to clean the VD1 & VD2 air ducts, replace the PF1& PF2 dust filters with new units and clean the V1 & V2 fan grills. Ivanishin meanwhile performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anatoly also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur) Anton set up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM window #9 for another 1h 50m sun-glint observation session, using the bracket-mounted spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor) for unattended ops, synchronized with the coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloaded the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.  Before sleeptime, FE-1 will initiate overnight recharge of the DZZ-12 battery.        [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.] Oleg had ~2 hrs reserved for the periodic image sensor cleaning on the new NIKON D3 #2 and NIKON D3X #1 digital cameras.     [Digital imaging sensor cleaning is best performed by air blowing (with a blower bulb).  Progress 46P delivered a Sensor Clear objective lens which is used to efficiently monitor sensor contamination.  At some point, Nikon changed their imaging sensor technology.   Single-use wet brushes which were delivered by Soyuz 29S were effective to clean Nikon D2X’s.  However, on the more recent Nikon D3X and Nikon D3 cameras they may leave traces of what looks like dried up micro drops at the point where the brush lifts off from the surface or stops in the middle or at the edge of the sensor.  This was discovered when Nikon D3X was prepared for the Progress 46P launch.] Dan again had a time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.        [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] At ~10:25am EDT, Dan Burbank & Don Pettit supported a PAO TV downlink, responding to interview questions from Fox News Network’s program “America’s Newsroom” (Bill Hemmer). Burbank performed a session of the Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video was then downlinked via MPC.     [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for T2, with ARED+T2, CEVIS, T2 (Treadmill Kinematics) following in the next 3 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Allalin Glacier, Lipetsk, the volcanoes Levotobi, Stromboli, Mount Etna and Hierro, the Volga River delta, and the Caspian Sea,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Kiev, Ukraine (Capital Cities Collection:  ISS hade a descending, nadir pass over this capital city of Ukraine with a population of 2.6 million.  Fair weather was expected as ISS passed over this area, with a possibility of a few clouds.  The city is located on the Dnieper River, just south of the Kiev Reservoir.  Trying to capture the entire city in the shots), Monaco, Monaco (Capital Cities Collection:  As ISS tracked southeastward over Western Europe, the crew was to look left of track on the coastline for Monaco, with fair weather expected.  A bulge in the coastline and port facilities are the visual cues for this capital city), Asmara, Eritrea (Capital Cities Collection:  As ISS tracked SE near the Red Sea, the crew was to aim nadir for this hard-to-detect city.  Asmara, the Eritrean capital city of nearly 600,000, lies at elevation of 7,628 ft near a great escarpment that marks edge of the Eritrean Highlands with the shores of the Red Sea just 50 miles to the east), Lisbon, Portugal (Capital Cities Collection:  As ISS tracked SE over the Atlantic Ocean towards the Iberian Peninsula, the crew was to look nadir for the great estuary of the Tagus River.  Clear weather was expected for this area.  Greater Lisbon appears as the gray zone on either side of the estuary.  The city center lied near the ISS ground track at the narrow, coastal end of the estuary.  Bridges over the estuary may have been visible), and Accra, Ghana (Capital Cities Collection:  Ghana's capital is the nation's largest city with a population near 2 million and is located on the coast to the south of Lake Volta, the world's largest reservoir.  ISS had an afternoon pass with a few clouds with its approach from the NW.  At this time as it neared the coast, the crew was to look just left of track for this urban area on the coast).
