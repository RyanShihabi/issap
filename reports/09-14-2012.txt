ISS On-Orbit Status 09/14/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-6 Hoshide had Day 5 of his 4th (FD120) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of pH testing. In addition to closing out the associated 24-hr urine sample collections, Akihiko today also underwent the generic blood draw, assisted by Suni Williams, then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the JPM MELFI (JEM Pressurized Module Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  After photographing his diet log for downlink, Aki stowed the equipment used for the urine & blood collections.      [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] Hoshide also conducted Part 4 of the periodic noise measurement protocol, collecting the crew-worn acoustic dosimeters of the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) from the Soyuz 30S crew, i.e., Gennady (1003), Sergei (#1004) & Joe (#1005), after their 24-hr data take, downloaded the data and stowed the dosimeters after removing their batteries. FE-3 Acaba had 3h 45m to perform major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the WRS (Water Recovery System) rack 2 in Node-3 (loc. D4) by removing & replacing the failed FCPA (Fluids Control & Pump Assembly).  The IFM was successful.     [The work was broken down in rotating the rack away from the shell wall to gain access to the rear FCPA connections (~25 min), removing the failed FCPA, replacing it with the spare (~40 min each), and closing out the worksite (~45 min.).  For the temporary removal of the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) “Kabin”, the T2/COLBERT exerciser was locked down, with snubbers installed. The R&R required careful demating & remating of 6 electrical connectors and numerous fluid QDs (quick disconnects), plus affixing connector caps on the failed unit.  Since the FCPA contains TOX2 fluid (pretreated urine, sulfuric acid H2SO4 & chromic acid CrO3), the QDs were protectively bagged (3rd level of containment), and Joe had to wear proper PPE (Personnel Protective Equipment), i.e., safety goggles, dust mask and nitrile gloves.  Background: On 9/6, the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) shut down unexpectedly due to high motor current in the FCPA.  Following an unsuccessful restart attempt on 9/7 to gather data and recover UPA functionality, the WHC was configured to collect in internal EDV-U containers while further troubleshooting continued.  On 9/11, one additional restart was unsuccessful in recovering UPA functionality.] FE-2 prepared samples of the Russian BTKh-44 Kaltsiy (“Calcium”) biotechnology payload for return to Earth, removing two of the six Bioekologia canisters (no. 10-3 & no. 10-4) from their location, taking documentary photography for Bioprobirok and packing the cases for return on Soyuz 30S.  The photos were processed and downlinked via the RSPI radio transmission data link.     [Kaltsiy studies the possible cause of calcium homeostasis destruction in human organism, i.e. calcium loss in bone tissue in microgravity. Under investigation is the solubility of calcium phosphates and human bone tissue samples in water in microgravity.  In Phase I of the experiment the exposure duration of Bioekologia cans until the end of the first session is 3 months. Subsequent sessions are held for 6, 12 and 18 months upon equipment delivery to the ISS. There are six Bioekologia cases which are afterwards returned to the ground with proexposed samples and photos of biotubes content.] Revin also de-installed & removed the TBU-V incubator from the MRM1 Rassvet (Panel 102) after its use in the last few days for the BTKh-26 KASKAD payload (which was loaded on Soyuz 30S yesterday for return). In preparation for his return to gravity next Sunday (along with Padalka & Acaba), Sergei Revin afterwards undertook Part 1 of his 5th and final exercise/training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the TVIS treadmill, with CDR Padalka assisting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Medical telemetry was monitored on the ground for part of the closeout session.  Part 2 follows tomorrow.        [The assessment, lasting 90 min., supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground sites, uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance after several months in zero-G.  The closeout exercise generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -20, -25, -35, -40 mmHg (Torr) for 5 min. each, followed by -10 mmHg for 1 min., -20, -35, -40 mmHg for 10 min. each, and a final 30 mmHg for 5 min. and drop to 0 mmHg, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure, medically monitored with the Gamma-1M hardware.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] FE-3 Acaba serviced the WRS (Water Recovery System) by offloading the Lab condensate tank to its neutral point to one of the CWCs (Contingency Water Containers), which amounted to about 40 min. Joe also completed another weekly 10-min. CWC inventory as part of continuing WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.     [The current card (32-0027I) lists 18 CWCs (264.63 L total), including 2 empty bags, for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (4 CWCs with 171.7 L);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (8 CWCs with 69.25 L); and 4. Waste water (1 CWC with 9.68 L bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L, stowed in ATV3 for disposal.  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] FE-5 Williams performed periodic maintenance on the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) by cleaning and lubricating its beverage adapter to restore functionality. Afterwards, Williams opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment and activated the ISSAC laptop, so ground images can be captured by ground commanding.       [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] Later, Sunita set up the USND (Ultrasound) with video camcorder and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), placed reference markers on thigh & calf of her right leg, donned the SPRINT thigh & calf guides and then, with the help of Aki Hoshide, performed her 3rd (FD60) SPRINT leg scan with remote guidance from ground teams.     [SPRINT (Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study) evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise training to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in ISS crewmembers during long-duration missions.] After the ground-controlled on-orbit functional checkout of the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System), Hoshide deactivated the facility and closed down the ABRS software on the ER2 (EXPRESS Rack 2) laptop (Lab loc. 101).  [ABRS was last deactivated by TJ Creamer on 5/18/10, completing ABRS activities for Increment 23/24.]  Working on the MSPR (Multipurpose Small Payload Rack) in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Aki supported the ground by activating AQH components for ground-controlled operation (continuing the remaining part of the functional checkout that SSIPC [Space Station Integration & Promotion Center] could not complete on 9/7), before deactivating the equipment about 5 hrs later.      [For the run, Aki relocated an Ethernet cable from the MDLT (Medical Laptop) to the PLT2 (Payload Laptop Terminal 2) and then activated PLT2, VRU (Video Compression & Recording Unit), Hub, AQH Controller and ELT (Experiment Laptop Terminal).  Components and laptops were later turned off by reversing the activation sequence and returning the Ethernet data cable.   Background: The JAXA AQH is a closed-water circulatory system, which provides a new facility option ISS-based research. Scientists will use the habitat to study small, freshwater fish on orbit. For the first investigations, they plan to examine the Medaka fish (Oryzias latipes), looking at the impacts of radiation, bone degradation, muscle atrophy, and developmental biology. The investigations could last up to 90 days and provide data that may lead to a better understanding of related human health concerns here on Earth. Medaka fish are ideal specimens for many reasons. They are transparent, making it easy to view the inner workings of their organs. They also breed quickly and easily in micro-G environments, enabling multi-generation studies. Researchers can take advantage of a variety of genetic modifications to these fish, as well. Also, scientists already have all of the Medaka genome identified, which makes it easier to recognize any alterations to the fishes’ genes, due to factors like space radiation.] FE-4 Yuri Malenchenko undertook his 2nd MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) tests, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, preceded by PZEh-MO-8 BMM (body mass measurement) using the IM device.      [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM, the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with Yuri’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.] Later, Malenchenko supported the ground-commanded initiation of the 3rd repressurization of the cabin atmosphere with about 600g of O2 (oxygen) remaining in the ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) tankage, for about 10hrs (4:30am-2:35pm EDT).     [FE-4 was told to reorient the AED (Air Exhaust Duct) outlet towards the GCP (Gas Control Panel) to maximize airflow to the GCP base since photos had shown that AED was not oriented suitably.] For the Russian experiment BTKh-11 Biodegradatsiya ("Biodegradation”), Yuri collected the periodic bio samples from specific metallic equipment and structures for stowage in the 30S Descent Module for microbial analysis on Earth.  FE-4 also took documentary video/photography of samples & locations.      [Samples were collected in the SM behind panels 139 & 407, from the BKS cable system behind panel 221, from behind Elektron-VM panel 429, at window #26 & VV ventilation fan in the SM PrK Transfer Tunnel, and at the SKV-1 air conditioner (panel 204).  The activities were documented by Yuri with the Nikon D2X digital camera with SB 28DX flash attachment for downlink to TsUP/Moscow via RSPI.] Later, Yuri also performed standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 by downloading the accumulated data of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to an HDD (hard disk drive) for return to Earth on Soyuz 30S       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] Hoshide collected the 17 30S-delivered RBO-3 MATRYOSHKA-R PADLE (Passive Area Dosimeters for Lifescience Experiment) radiation dosimeters from the walls of the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and JPL (JEM Pressurized Logistics Segment) and turned them over to Sergei & Gennady who packed them for return to Earth on 30S. FE-5 Williams completed the visual T+2 days (44 ± 4h) microbial (bacterial & fungal) analysis of three water samples collected by her on 9/12 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) SVO-ZV and SRV-K ports (125 mL each) using the WMK MCD (Water Microbiology Kit / Microbial Capture Devices) for microbial traces, and the CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for inflight coliform indications (Magenta for Positive, Yellow for Negative). FE-4 Malenchenko took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-2 Revin conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Afterwards, Revin started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, working in the MRM2 Poisk module to clean the PF1 & PF2 dust collectors and V1 & V2 fan screens.] Later, Sergei used the standard ECOSFERA equipment, set up yesterday, to conduct microbial air sampling runs, Part 2, for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment, with the POTOK Air Purification System temporarily powered down, taking Kit 1 samples from cabin surfaces along with samples from crewmembers for sanitation and disease studies.  The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container and subsequently packed for return in Soyuz 30S.     [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger, power supply unit, and incubation tray for Petri dishes, determines microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge at one given time, the sample collection must be performed in two stages.] Time again for recharging the Motorola Iridium-9505A satellite phone in the Soyuz Descent Modules, completed by Sergei Revin for TMA-04M/30S (#704, docked at MRM2) and by Yuri Malenchenko for TMA-05M/31S (#705, docked at MRM1), a monthly routine job, 3rd time for 30S, 2nd for 31S.     [After retrieving the phones from their location in the spacecraft Descent Module (SA, spuskayemyy apparat), the crewmembers initiated the recharge of the lithium-ion batteries, monitoring the process every 10-15 minutes as it took place.  Upon completion, the phone was returned inside its sealed SSSP Iridium kits and stowed back in the SA’s ODF (operational data files) container.  The satphone accompanies returning ISS crews on Soyuz reentry & landing for contingency communications with SAR (Search-and-Rescue) personnel after touchdown (e.g., after an “undershoot” ballistic reentry, as happened during the 15S return).  The Russian-developed procedure for the monthly recharging has been approved jointly by safety officials.  During the procedure, the phone is left in its fire-protective fluoroplastic bag with open flap.  The Iridium 9505A satphone uses the Iridium constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to relay the landed Soyuz capsule's GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates to helicopter-borne recovery crews.  The older Iridium-9505 phones were first put on board Soyuz in August 2003.  The newer 9505A phone, currently in use, delivers 30 hours of standby time and three hours of talk, up from 20 and two hours, respectively, on the older units.] Aki Hoshide serviced the VDS VTR-1 (Video Distribution Subsystem Video Tape Recorder 1) by swapping its tape with a new one. Next, FE-6 replaced the HRF2 PC2 (Human Research Facility 2/Portable Computer 2) with a new T61p laptop (#1085) & Ethernet data cable (HRF01265J), inserted the HDD of the old one, powered it on, flashed CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) settings and performed a fitness test on the drive. Aki also conducted his 2nd session with the U.S. HMS VIS (Health Maintenance Systems / Visual Acuity) testing program which uses an eye chart for both far & near visual acuity and an eye questionnaire (DCT/Data Collection Tool), to be filled out with test data and downloaded on a laptop for ground access. FE-3 Acaba & FE-5 Williams filled out their standard FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop).  It was Suni’s 7th, Joe’s 14th.      [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Gennady spent several more hours on packing & loading Russian & US cargo on the Soyuz 30S vehicle’s SA/Descent Module for return, while stowing excessed cargo & trash in BO/Orbital Module for disposal. Joe worked on his HMS (Health Maintenance System) personal & medical equipment, stowing it for return to Earth or discarding items. The 30S crewmembers, Padalka, Acaba & Revin, again had an hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which is standard pre-return procedure for homecoming crewmembers. At ~1:35pm EDT, Sunita, Yuri & Akihito teamed up for the standard one-hour Crew Emergency Roles & Responsibilities Review (peredacha smeniy po bezopasnosti), to familiarize themselves with their new emergency roles & responsibilities as Expedition 33 three-person crew, including escape routes.       [Baseline emergency response actions are covered in the EMER-1 book.  Emergencies may arise due to ammonia (NH3) leak, non-ammonia toxic spills, fire or rapid depressurization, and one or more members of the 31S crew could become incapacitated during such an emergency response.  Basically, ISS CDR is responsible for the safety of the crew & ISS, and he/she exercises overall direction of crew actions.  ISS integrated crew regroups into Soyuz crews following ISS CDR instructions or Vestibule-Soyuz hatch closure in the respective Soyuz.  ISS CDR can call non-prime crew from Soyuz and restore ISS integrated crew.  Each crewmember must be fully aware of procedure strategy and intent due to the complex nature of an emergency event.  Crew in ISS USOS (forward) locations should retreat towards ISS RS (aft) checking lateral modules during translation (e.g., PMM, NOD3 & Cupola) for other crewmembers. Crewmembers in ISS RS (aft) locations should move towards ISS USOS (forward) checking lateral modules during translation for other crewmembers to assist in the notification and retreat of ISS USOS (forward) crewmembers until all are accounted for. If necessary, the crew dons emergency breathing equipment to enter a contaminated atmosphere to find/rescue a crewmember and retreat to the safe location. Subsequent accountability must be maintained for individual Soyuz crews.  In general, each Soyuz CDR remains responsible or the configuration of their Soyuz throughout the docked mission to include the Soyuz related steps in an ISS emergency response.] At ~4:00am, Gennady, Sergei, Joe, Yuri & Suni held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Main Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~4:15am, Padalka, Malenchenko & Revin linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~12:45pm, Williams held a phone conference with ground specialists on EVA topics for the upcoming Increment. At ~3:10pm, the crewmembers conducted their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston. Before Presleep (~3:40pm), Acaba turned on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [FE-6 & FE-5 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Suni’s protocol for today showed T2/Kinematics.] Sunita Williams & Joe Acaba each conducted today’s SPRINT session on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill with the Treadmill Kinematics protocol, Suni’s 3rd time, Joe’s 5th, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on her body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.      [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), andA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andPersonal iPad setup for operation with new WPA2 through SM WAP encryption by NASA. ISS/ATV Reboost Update:  A one-burn reboost of the ISS with the ATV-3 OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters was performed last night at 11:05pm EDT with a burn duration of 8 min 56 sec, achieving a delta-V of 1.28 m/s (planned: 1.30 m/s), increasing mean altitude by 2.23 km (planned: 2.28 km).  After the burn, ISS was at 417.08 km mean altitude, with 434.61 km apogee height and 399.54 km perigee height.  Purpose of the reboost was to set up orbit phasing for Soyuz 30S landing (9/16) and Soyuz 32S launch.  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Dili, East Timor (Capital Cities Collection: The capital city of East Timor with a population of almost 200,000 is located on the north coast of eastern Timor Island.  As ISS tracked SE over the Banda Sea, the crew was to look right of track to capture long lens shots of this city), Berlin, Germany (Capital Cities Collection: Clear weather was forecasted for the city of Berlin as ISS passed over the city in mid-morning light. The German capital of almost 3.5 million is located in the northeastern part of the country in an area of low-lying, marshy woodlands and small lakes with mainly flat topography, a part of the Northern European Plain. As ISS tracked E across Germany, the crew was to aim left of track for this capital city), Luxembourg, Luxembourg (Capital Cities Collection: Weather conditions are predicted to be clear over central Europe at the time of the overpass. Looking right of track for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg - the world's only remaining sovereign grand duchy. The country is landlocked and borders Belgium, France, and Germany. Overlapping and mapping frames were requested), Kunene River Fan, NAM-AGO (ISS had a nadir pass in clear weather and mid-afternoon light with its approach from the NW.  This large alluvial fan lies between the Kunene River in Angola [north] and Namibia’s Etosha Pan [south} and is subject to periodic flooding from the north.  At this time, looking nadir and beginning a detailed mapping strip of the fan. Open water may still be visible in many parts of the fan), Cedar Creek Area, MN (Long Term Ecological Research Site [LTER]: Detailed images of this well-studied, but small target were requested. Looking nadir between the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers.  A major scientific study has stated that Cedar Creek Natural History Area “is rapidly becoming one of ecology’s classic localities.” Cedar Creek Natural History Area was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1975. In 1982 it was one of 11 sites in the United States selected by the National Science Foundation for funding of LTER), Mount Rainier, WA-USA (ISS had a clear weather pass for this target with approach from the NW.  Mount Rainier is a massive stratovolcano located 54 mile southeast of Seattle.  With an elevation of 14,411 feet, Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world.  Because of its large amount of glacial ice, Mt. Rainier could potentially produce massive lahars that would threaten the whole Puyallup River valley.  At this time as ISS tracked over Seattle, the crew was to shoot just right of track and try for a detailed mapping session of the summit area), and Niwot Ridge Tundra, CO ([LTER]:  ISS had a near-nadir view of this target area in early afternoon light with clear weather anticipated. This LTER site is located in north-central Colorado within the alpine areas above 3,000m just west of Boulder.  As ISS tracked southeastward over the Colorado Rockies, before it reach the plains to the east, the crew was to try for contextual mapping of the ridge and its surroundings).
