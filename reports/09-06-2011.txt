ISS On-Orbit Status 09/06/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel. At wake-up, FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Afterwards, FE-4 Volkov took his 2nd MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) test, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, along with PZEh-MO-8 body mass measurement using the IM device.      [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM, the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with Sergei’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.] In preparation for their return on Soyuz 26S in 10 days (9/15-16), Andrey Borisenko, Alexandr Samokutyayev & Ron Garan donned their intravehicular Sokol pressure suits and performed a fit-check in their body-contoured Kazbek couches in the spacecraft while conducting the standard leak check, a 45-min job.  After doffing the suits, Sasha set up the suits and gloves for drying and then stowed the gear. Volkov conducted the routine verification of last Friday’s refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the recent (8/8) installation of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Preparatory to a live event planned on 9/18, FE-5 Furukawa performed another end-to-end checkout of the JAXA SSHDTV (Super Sensitive HDTV Camera).        [Activities involved transferring the camera from the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and installing it in the Node-3 Cupola, transferring the SSHDTV converter from Kibo and installing it in the US Lab, configuring drag-through cables, equipping the SSHDTV with the single focus 17mm lens and inserting a 32GB memory card, then taking test video of the Earth surface.  Afterwards, the equipment was torn down and the camera returned to the JPM.] In the JPM, Satoshi also set up the G1 HD camcorder, powered on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and used the medical laptop for performing Demo 2 of the JAXA ODK (Onboard Diagnostic Kit) with a medical doctor at SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion enter)/Tsukuba in an open-press session. Later, FE-5 gathered the LEGO equipment, including the LEGO Space Shuttle, and reviewed procedures for another JAXA/NASA EPO (Education Program Operation) demo of “LEGO Brick Building”, scheduled tomorrow. Supporting the deactivation of the RS (Russian Segment) Elektron-VM oxygen (O2) generator by ground commanding, Sergei Volkov purged its BZh Liquid Unit with nitrogen (N2) at 0.65 kg/cm2 via its KE3 & VN3 valves, a periodic safety measure. Afterwards, Sergei performed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and ensured proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)], Conducting troubleshooting on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) display, FE-6 Fossum swapped the ARED data cable with a LIB (Lithium-Ion Battery) charger USB cable and connected it to a T61P SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop. Later, Fossum had another ~2h15m set aside (out of a total of 6 hrs planned) for relocating payload hardware from the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) to appropriate locations in “their” science modules, in order to create some empty space in the PMM RSRs (Resupply Stowage Racks) to be used for upcoming stowage arrangements. Working in the US Lab at rack bay P4, Mike mated all EXPRESS-8 ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) rack-to-module umbilical cables at UIP (Utility Interface Panel).       [The job involved 10 ARIS power/data cables and 4 ARIS fluid cables (GN2, coolant in/out & vacuum exhaust).] After the recent checkout sessions at negative & positive Beta angles, CDR Borisenko had ~2 hrs set aside for returning the Russian ASN-M Satellite Navigation System to its nominal configuration, reconnecting cables from the RSK-2 A31p laptop and the NPM navigation electronics modules, supported by ground specialist tagup.       [ASN-M will be required for ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) docking at the SM aft port next year.] Afterwards, Andrey performed routine maintenance on the KN1(2) and KV1(2) valves of the SM Rodnik tanks, to prevent their failure during the long-term water stowage.       [Each of the four valves was activated twice (On/Off) from the IKR (Rodnik Control System Indicator) panel.] Meanwhile, Sasha Samokutyayev configured the pumping equipment with the electric compressor (#41), replaced the usual A-R water transfer hose with a T2PrU air line and started the standard bladder compression & leak check of the BV2 water tank of Progress M-10M/42P (#410), docked at DC-1 nadir, to get it ready for urine transfer.      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 & BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.] Ron Garan had ~3h set aside for personal crew departure preparations; these are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers. Later, FE-3 performed routine service of two VCRs (Video Cassette Recorders) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), using a cleaning tape in two cycles on the video heads. In the SM, FE-1 Samokutyayev collected the periodic KAV condensate water samples from the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor (water recovery system) upstream of the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit, then removed sampler & separator and disposed of flush water. Borisenko continued the ongoing inventorying/auditing of stowage contents in the FGB for another ~3 hrs, today behind panels 426 & 427, going by an uplinked roster listing 422 individual equipment (oborud) items. Later, the CDR completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Andrey also did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Activities completed by FE-5 Furukawa included –Opening the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Satoshi will close the shutters again;  [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use],The regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks),Adjusting the VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) in COL to view FSL (Fluid Science Laboratory) and VMU (Video Management Unit), then swapping the HDDs (Hard Disk Drives HDD1 & HDD2 in VMU in their positions,Setting up & verifying USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) and VPC (Video Power Converter) hardware in the Lab for Mike’s SPRINT scan tomorrow, and connecting the VPC to HRF (Human Research Facility) Rack 1,Clearing the front of the D4 & O4 racks in COL of stowage to make room for using the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device),    [D4 items were to be restowed at the D2 rack front, O4 items at the O2 rack front], andContinued unpacking & stowing items brought up by ULF7 for another hour, using an updated uplinked unpack list. FE-4 Volkov checked out proper MKSD Control & Data Acquisition Module communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, then copied science & service data, accumulated from the GFI-17 Molniya-GAMMA experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28, over to RSS1 and prepared them for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.] With the FSS Photospectrograph battery freshly charged overnight, FE-4 used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 during a one-hour segment, taking pictures of targets along the flight track, including Darwin Island in the Galapagos archipelago, Pacific ocean, Arenal volcano, Caribbean sea, typical images of underlying surfaces on the island of Cuba (fields, natural, and man-made targets), and the Atlantic ocean up to Hamilton island.        [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] Garan equipped the HRF Rack 2 T61p laptop with new software, first performing a drive fitness test, then installing the HRF Integrated Load (Build #11) on the T61p from DVD. Later, Ron performed his 4th session of the new Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.]Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron turns on the MPC and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Before sleeptime, Volkov is to initiate overnight (10-hr) charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery for the Piren-V Pyro-endoscope, part of the Russian BAR science instruments suite (other BAR components being the ТТМ-2 Anemometer-Thermometer, the charger cable, and the video display unit).      [Piren-V, a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, is part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Besides Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] CDR, FE-1 & FE-4 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Andrey at ~10:00am, Sasha at ~12:25pm, Sergei at ~1:15pm EDT. At ~10:30am, Garan & Fossum supported a 30-min PAO TV event – the Expedition 28 Crew News Conference with U.S. media at NASA centers, via JSC phone bridge The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).     [Mike Fossum is currently following a special experimental “SPRINT” protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5hrs per day regime and introduces special daily sessions.  No exercise will be timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Mike picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] Two items added to the voluntary U.S. “Job Jar” list are –An activity to power cycle (reboot) ALTEA-Shield to prevent further science loss after SDUs (Silicon Detector Units) 1 & 2 stopped transmitting on 8/13, andAn activity to repair the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) stray light cover.  A task listed for Andrey, Sergei & Sasha on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today continued to be the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). SPDM Update:   Beginning in tonight’s Crew Presleep period, Robotics controllers on the ground will begin SSRMS/SPDM (Space Station Remote Manipulator System/Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) operations to remove the launch locks on the RRM (Robotic Refueling Mission) payload.  Additionally, the ground will stow the RMCT (Robot Micro Conical Tool) & configure the SSRMS/SPDM for the operations planned for the next night.  These operations will run until the next morning past the Postsleep period.  For dynamic load reasons, Russian thrusters will be disabled from 4:00pm to 5:00am tomorrow morning.  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
