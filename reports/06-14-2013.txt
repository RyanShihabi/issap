New Status:
Off duty day for USOS Crew: Today was an off duty day for Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy, FE-5 Parmitano, and FE6 Nyberg as compensation for supporting tomorrow’s ATV4 operations. ATV4 is scheduled to dock tomorrow, Saturday June 15th at 8:46 am CST.

Biological Rhythms: Nyberg terminated her first 24-hour Biological Rhythm measurement and exchanged the multimedia card and battery on the Digital Walk Halter Electrocardiogram.  After exchanging the multimedia card and battery, Nyberg initiated a second 24 hour recording session. The investigation examines the circadian variations in the cardiac autonomic function during space flight. Results aim to improve crew health technology on long-duration space flights.




Environmental Health System (EHS) Acoustic Dosimeter Setup: Parmitano set up and donned a crew-worn acoustic dosimeter which he will wear for 24 hours.  Acoustic data collected by the dosimeter will be downlinked to the ground for analysis.








Robotic Operations: Overnight, Robotics Ground Controllers attempted to move Cargo Transportation Container (CTC)5 from ExPRESS Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3 to External Stowage Platform (ESP) 2. CTC5 was released from ELC3 and maneuvered to ESP2, at which point two issues became evident. The side of CTC5 facing the adjacent Direct Current Switching Unit (DCSU) on ESP2 has handrails with clearances that were tighter than expected. In addition, the DCSU located on ESP2 has a thermal cover with fabric loops that could interfere with CTC5. The decision was made to return CTC5 to ELC3 and re-install it while ground teams review forward plans.
