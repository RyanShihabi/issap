07-07-2012July 07, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 07/07/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty. At wakeup, Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. The three crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Sergei & Gennady also completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), and the grilles of the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System and SKV air conditioner in the SM. The CDR handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-3 Acaba conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Deferred from yesterday, Joe took closeout photos of all the lockers in the P1 & O1 racks in the ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3).    [With its fan nonfunctional but IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) on, smoke detection & CO2 monitoring is temporarily a crew function.] Also deferred from yesterday, Gennady conducted another transfer of water from Tank 1 of the ATV3 WDS (Water Delivery System) to fill an EDV-RP container via the P-P water transfer hose with BP pumping equipment.      [ATV3 WDS Tank 1 contained ~90L.] Working in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Acaba configured HRMS (High Rate Data Multiplexer & Switcher) patch cable connections for the MCE (Multi-mission Consolidated Equipment) arriving with the HTV3 (H-2 Transfer Vehicle) and the MSPR (Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack). While in the Kibo lab, Joe also checked out its fire indicator illuminators to verify that the fire indication lights in the JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment), JEM RMS (Robotic Manipulator System), ISPRs (International Standard Payload Racks) A2, A3, A4, F1 and F5 are all functioning properly. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2).  Tasks listed for Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). Kurs-P Test:   At 3:17am-3:35am EDT, Moscow conducted a standard test of the Kurs-P passive radio navigation transponder on the FGB, run from the pre-positioned CSB test program during RGS LOS (Russian Groundsite Loss of Signal). Thanks:   Thank you to the crew for using their personal time taking photos to lend their support to a young man in Dallas with terminal cancer. Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-Two – Week 1). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD Shielding (NASA/ASI):     To date, 27 cumulative days of measurements have been performed. Session#1 must be pursued for a minimum of 40-60 cumulative days.       [Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):      No report.

Asian Seed 2010 (JAXA):    Returned on ULF6. BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      This week we performed five tests.  In the first, Joe Acaba flipped the SIBAL sample (cotton-fiberglass fabric) so that we could examine opposed-flow flame spread.  The igniter was positioned so that the flame would spread into the 10 cm/s air stream.  The sample ignited and burned to completion. This test is significant because the SIBAL sample is unable to sustain downward flame spread in 1-g (the opposed flow configuration is equivalent to downward spread on Earth).  The flame shape is very stable as it spreads across the sample indicating that steady state is reached.  Next we examined the combustion of a candle sample.  The candle measures about 2.5 cm in length and 0.5 cm in diameter.  It is enclosed in a ceramic tube.  The type of wax used is “Japan wax” which tends to be the least sooting compared to other waxes.  The candle was mounted so that the wick pointed into the oncoming flow, and the air flow speed was varied.  The purpose was to determine the best camera settings for subsequent tests.  A total of three ignitions were achieved before the candle ran out of wax.  The flame was generally yellow except at the very lowest flow speeds (less than 1 cm/s).  In the fifth and final test of the day, we re-ignited a previously-burned flat acrylic sample in a 5 cm/s air flow.  A very small dim blue flame (1-cm in length) slowly spread across the sample before going out by itself after around 90 s.  A fan calibration indicated the flow was nominal.  We were a bit concerned that the candle tests would yield wax aerosols which might plug the exit screen of the BASS hardware, but so far this does not appear to be an issue. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
