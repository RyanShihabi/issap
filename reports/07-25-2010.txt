ISS On-Orbit Status 07/25/10  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – crew rest day.  Ahead: Week 8 of Increment 24. >>>>Today ten years ago (7/25/2000) ISS reached habitability with the successful docking of the Service Module Zvezda to the FGB module (with Node-1 Unity attached since 12/4/98) at 8:44pm EDT (7/26/00 Russian time).<<<<  Upon wake-up, CDR Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR will inspect the filters again before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Also at wake-up, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson completed another run of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]  The CDR completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].  Alex also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.  An additional task for Sasha in the SM was the routine weekly inspection of the SVO SRV-K2M (Condensate Water Processor) hoses from the MF-R Diaphragm Separator Filter to the BRPK Condensate Separation & Pumping Unit.  Kornienko, Yurchikhin, Skvortsov & Wheelock got together for a 2-hr timeline review for the Russian EVA-25 by Mikhail & Fyodor starting tomorrow night.  The review was supported by tagup with ground specialists.  FE-3 Kornienko & FE-5 Yurchikhin checked their Orlan-MK spacesuits after the EVA dryrun on 7/23, refilling the drinking bags with water.  Also for tomorrow’s EVA-25, Mikhail retrieved three “Pille-MKS” radiation dosimeters, recording their dosages and equipping each of the two Orlan-MK suits (in pocket on left calf) with a sensor unit (A0306/FE-3 & A0307/FE-5).    [A third sensor, A0311, remain on duty for SM background readings on the Pille Reader tray].  Fyodor completed the periodic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program in the Russian VKS auxiliary (non-network) laptops RSS1, RSK1, RSK2, RSE1, which are not loaded from the ground, from a special software program working with Norton AV on the FS (File Server) laptop, first scanning the latter, then transferring the database by flash-card to the other computers and scanning them one by one.     [Only the RSS2 laptop is automatically updated (once a week on Fridays from MCC-Houston).]  At ~8:00am EDT, Fyodor also conducted his PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).  Kornienko & Yurchikhin their pre-EVA PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Mike at ~1:15pm, Fyodor at ~1:30pm.  Before sleeptime, Tracy will power down the amateur/ham radio equipment to prevent RF interference with the spacewalkers’ suit radios.  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-4, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3, FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]   Major Sleep-shift ahead:    To accommodate tomorrow night’s spacewalk, crew day/night cycle will shift by 12h40m, by extending tonight’s “sleeptime” to last from 5:30pm tonight to 2:40pm EDT tomorrow.
