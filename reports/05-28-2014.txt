39 Soyuz (39S) Launch/Dock: 39S launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 2:57pm CDT today with Max Suraev, Reid Wiseman and Alexander Gerst onboard.  Docking to the Mini-Research Module (MRM)-1 port of the ISS occurred at 8:44pm CDT.  Following hatch opening, the entire crew participated in a welcome ceremony and later will conduct a safety briefing.  With the 39S crew arrival, the ISS is back to a full 6-crew complement.
Sprint Ultrasound: Commander (CDR) Swanson collected ultrasound data for his Flight Day (FD) 60 Sprint session. Sprint evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise training to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in ISS crewmembers during long-duration missions. Ultrasound scans are on FD 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 7 days before return for a mission duration of six months and are used to evaluate spaceflight-induced changes in the muscle volume.
Environmental Health System (EHS) Sound Level Meter (SLM) Activities: Swanson measured the acoustic environment in the habitable areas of the ISS by taking sound level readings. He then downlinked results to the ground for evaluation.
Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) Status: Following an ARED dashpot inspection yesterday it was discovered that 2 of the 4 x-axis dashpots were broken and the other 2 were degraded. The crew was instructed to stand down on ARED use until a Remove & Replace (R&R) could be scheduled. Today Swanson began replacing the broken dashpots. When he finishes the activity later this week he will conduct a  2-part activation and checkout prior to ARED being declared GO for use. 
Crew Medical Officer (CMO) On-Board Training (OBT): Swanson performed a session of this OBT today. It is a Computer Based Training (CBT) module that requires no ground interaction and is performed periodically to maintain proficiency for designated CMOs.
