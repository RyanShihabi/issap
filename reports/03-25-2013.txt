New Status:
SpaceX-2 Dragon Cargo Transfers and Departure Preparation: Commander (CDR) Chris Hadfield and Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Tom Marshburn loaded five full coldbags and an active GLACIER with returning science samples into the Dragon vehicle forward rack, and at 8:25 am CDT closed the Dragon hatch. Afterwards they configured the Dragon Pressurized Segment for closeout by removing utility jumpers, and installing required hardware needed prior to Dragon Vestibule depressurization and Dragon demate. CDR Hadfield completed Node 2 Nadir Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) Controller Panel Assembly (CPA) Installation, which is required for Mission Control Center – Houston (MCC-H) to perform the Node 2 Nadir CBM preparation for Dragon demate.  Dragon is scheduled to unberth from the ISS at 6:06 am CDT tomorrow.
Previous Status (3/22/13)
SpaceX-2 Unberth Delay:  The SpaceX Dragon vehicle unberth and departure from ISS was scheduled for Monday March 25th but has been deferred due to rough seas predicted at the splash-down location. The new unberth and departure date is Tuesday March 26, 2013. 

On-board Training (OBT) for Emergency Response: All 3 crewmembers participated in this training. The crew physically translated through ISS to the appropriate response locations to visualize the use of station equipment and interfaces; practiced procedure execution and associated decision making based on cues provided by the simulator; and practiced communication and coordination with Mission Control Center-Houston (MCC-H) and MCC-Moscow (M) as required for a given emergency scenario.

Crystal Growth of Alloy Semiconductor Under Microgravity (Alloy Semiconductor): Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Marshburn installed the 5 alloy cartridges into the Gradient Heating Furnace (GHF) of the Kobairo rack for the start of the Alloy Semiconductor experiment. He will then conduct the first insulation resistance test. This investigation aims to understand how semiconductor materials grow and crystallize in microgravity by looking at crystal growth factors of a high-quality bulk alloy semiconductor such as (1) solute transport in liquid and (2) the dependence of growth kinetics on surface orientation under microgravity and terrestrial conditions. The materials studied are known to be useful as devices which convert heat into electricity (thermoelectrics).
Coarsening in Solid Liquid Mixture 3 (CSLM-3) Experiment:  Commander (CDR) Hadfield initiated the vacuum vent start in preparation for the 6th and final run tomorrow of this experiment. Samples will be returned on SpaceX-2. CSLM-3 is a materials science investigation that studies the growth and solidification processes (i.e., coarsening) in lead-tin solid-liquid mixtures that contain a small amount of tin branch-like (dendrite) structures, some of which possess many arms. During sample heating, the growth at the tip of each dendrite continues over time, whereas side branches, behind the tip, develop during constant temperature conditions. By understanding how temperature and time control the growth of such dendrites, researchers hope to develop more efficient and economical means of producing higher quality products derived from the casting of molten metals.
ENERGY Experiment: Marshburn participated in a conference with the Ground in preparation for the start of this experiment next week. A loss in astronauts’ body mass is a systematic observation during space flight. The aim of ENERGY is to measure changes in energy balance during long term space flight; measure adaptations in the components of the Total Energy Expenditure (consumption); and to derive an equation for the energy requirements of astronauts.
Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Communication Unit (CUCU): In preparation for SpaceX-2 unberth, Hadfield powered up and conducted a checkout of the COTS UHF CUCU and Dragon Crew Command Panel (CCP).
