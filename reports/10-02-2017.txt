External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Light Bulb R&R: Today the crew will removed, replaced, and tested two metal halide lamps bulbs. These light assemblies are used to illuminate sections of ISS during periods of darkness and support continuous operations.  After bulb failure, these assemblies can be removed and replaced during an Extra Vehicular Activity.  
Rechargeable Extravehicular Battery Assembly (REBA) Hardware Checkout: In support of the upcoming LEE-A EVA on Thursday, crewmembers installed freshly charged REBAs and perform a series of checkouts to ensure optimum performance.  
External Robotics Operations:  Today ground controllers translated the Mobile Transporter (MT) from Worksite 6 to Worksite 5 and maneuver the Space Station Robotics Manipulator System (SSRMS) in preparation for Thursday’s LEE-A EVA. The MT is moveable platform which allows the SSRMS to operate across multiple areas of ISS.
