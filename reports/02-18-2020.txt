Double Cold Bag (DCB):  The crew transferred and unpacked three refrigerated Double Cold Bags (DCB) into the appropriate MELFI, GLACIER, MERLIN, and ambient locations.  After the science items were removed from the DCBs, the ice bricks and DCBs were temporarily stowed to dry out.  The DCBs are passive (non-powered) bags which are used to maintain temperatures at acceptable levels during the vehicle ascent or descent.  The Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFIs), General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIERs), and Microgravity Experiment Research Locker/Incubator (MERLINs) are the powered refrigerators, freezers, and incubators aboard the ISS.
Systems:
Northrop Grumman (NG)-13 Mission:  NG-13 Cygnus vehicle (S.S. Robert Henry Lawrence Jr.) rendezvoused with the ISS and was captured by the ISS Crew utilizing the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) at 3:05 am CT.  Following capture, the Cygnus spacecraft was maneuvered and berthed to the Node 1 nadir Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) by Robotics Ground Controllers and fully integrated with the ISS.  Once integrated, the crew ingressed the Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM) to transfer time critical payloads and cold bags from Cygnus to the ISS. The Cygnus NG-13 mission is part of the Commercial Resupply Services-2 (CRS-2) contract and is expected to be berthed to ISS until May 11, 2020.
