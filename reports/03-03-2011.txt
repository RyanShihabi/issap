ISS On-Orbit Status 03/03/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FD8 (Flight Day 8) of STS-133/ULF-5.    Crew partial rest day. Sleep cycle shift:  Crew wake/sleep cycle continues to shift. Current schedule for ISS crew (EST): DateWAKESLEEP3/34:53am7:53pm3/44:23am7:23pm3/53:53am4:33pm3/62:53am4:03pm3/71:00am4:30pm  FE-4 Kondratyev started the day by undertaking the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.] At wake-up, FE-1 Kaleri terminated his 12th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking & brushing teeth, Cady Coleman performed her 4th liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 4).       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] Also at wake-up, CDR Kelly, FE-5 Nespoli & FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 11th for Scott, the 12th for Cady & Paolo.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] In the SM (Service Module), FE-2 Skripochka activated & verified proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment which is taking structural dynamics data during the 26-min mated reboost at 9:03am EST.  The data were later copied to a USB stick for downlink to the ground.      [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control & Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.] Scott Kelly & Cady Coleman had several hours on their schedule for the CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) repair in Node-3, installing a new CDRA Bed 202 in the front location of the Node 3 AR2 (Atmosphere Revitalization 2) rack and removing & replacing the ASV (Air Selector Valve) 103 that has caused CDRA’s failure.       [For the IFM (In-flight Maintenance), the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) Kabin enclosure needed to be relocated temporarily (which made the WHC unusable for a while).  After the ground had remotely safed appropriate CDRA components, AR was partially rotated down for taking out and replacing the degraded ASV with a new spare, followed by the installation of the spare CDRA Bed in the front (202) location in the AR2 rack at Node-3 A4.  With the rack completely rotated down, all utility connections were remated (electrical/data, Low-Temperature-Loop cooling, air, vacuum), then the rear closeout panel closed and the rack rotated back up.  Finally, the toilet Kabin had to be re-installed.] Oleg Skripochka & Alex Kaleri completed their 2nd preliminary orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test run with the Russian Chibis suit in preparation for their return to gravity on 3/16 with Soyuz 24S (along with Scott Kelly), conducting the ODNT exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill.  Each crewmember took turns as Subject and CMO (Crew Medical Officer).   Alex was supported in his one-hour session by ground specialist tagup via VHF at 9:27am, Oleg at 11:02am EST.        [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  The preparatory training consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -30, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG SHKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap, supported by the Gamma-1M biomed data control system.   The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] Sasha Kaleri configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h 15m session, his 5th, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] FE-5 Nespoli closed the external shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) science windows to protect them against contamination from Shuttle VRCS (Vernier Reaction Control System) thruster effluents during the 9:03am-9:29am reboost. Afterwards, having set up the Lab camcorder to provide live coverage, Nespoli serviced the FIR FCF (Fluids Integrated Rack / Fluids & Combustion Facility), changing out the Bio sample.     [Activities included opening the rack doors, rotating the LMM SBA (Light Microscopy Module / Spindle Bracket Assembly) from the Operate to Service position and removing the used sample from the Bio Base for return to the Bio kit.  With a new sample from the kit installed, the SBA was rotated back to Operate, the upper & lower FCF rack doors were closed, and POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center/Huntsville) was notified that the rack was ready for RPC (Remote Power Controller) activation.  The LMM-Bio experiment is designed for autonomous operation through scripts and ground-based commanding.  Crew time is required for the initial installation and check out in the FIR, sample change out, and removal from the FIR.] Later, Paolo also serviced the new ESA EPO (Education Payload Operation) Greenhouse in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) by watering both greenhouses, a weekly activity. In the SM, Dmitri Kondratyev worked for several hours on Part 3 of the extensive repair of the Vozdukh CO2 (carbon dioxide) removal assembly.  Skripochka deactivated and removed the P-16 CO2 absorption/filter cartridges, now no longer required.       [After yesterday’s installation of the new BOA valve block/panel with plug-in assemblies & units and the subsequent leak checking, Dmitri today mated electrical connections, installed acoustic protection, evacuated the BVK-1, BVK-2, BVK-3 vacuum valves & AVK-1, AVK-2, AVK-3, AVK-SOA emergency vacuum valves, then activated the BOA for a functionality checkout.  Dmitri was supported by ground control & tagup from TsUP-Moscow.] For the remating of telemetry connectors at the Vozdukh, the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and VD-SU control mode had to be temporarily powered off. This required shutting down the Elektron O2 (oxygen) generator.   After restarting BITS2-12, Oleg Skripochka supported ground-commanded Elektron reactivation by monitoring the external temperature of its BD secondary purification unit for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating. Later, Dmitri re-assembled & installed the BRTK-TVS LIV video distribution system in the SM which he & Sasha had dismantled on 2/28 for the Vozdukh IFM. Activities completed by Alex Kaleri included –The periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA,The (currently daily) checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways which is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently twelve persons   [inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1],The regular inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness), andSetting up & readying the equipment for a session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), to be conducted tomorrow by Oleg, Dmitri, Paolo & himself. Oleg Skripochka completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-2 also serviced the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet, downloading structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer during the Shuttle reboost to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.     [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] Using the Russian KPT-12 payload with its BAR science instruments suite, Kaleri & Skripochka conducted another session of about 2 hrs, today using the Piren-B instrument to check out micro conditions of FGB panel surface material to assess the necessity of panel replacement.  This was a repeat inspection behind FGB panels in areas where the Exp 23 crew had spotted signs of microflora growth on the pressurized shell.  Problem area monitoring is necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data were downlinked via OCA, and the activities were supported by ground specialist tagup as required.       [Objective of the Russian KPT-12/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-B is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] Oleg completed the periodic transfer of condensate water to an RS EDV container for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis into oxygen & hydrogen, filling the designated KOV (condensate water) EDV container from US CWCs (Contingency Water Containers, #1064, #1043).  When filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.       [The ~40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the Elektron’s BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles are detected in the EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O2 generator.] Dmitri broke out and set up the new Russian radiation experiment Lulin-ISS, a part of the complex Matryoshka suite designed for sophisticated radiation studies.      [Dima set up the Lulin-ISS kit with four dosimeters (201, 202, 203, 204) with its BUI Interface Control Unit behind panel 121 and started battery charging for a preliminary data dump from the RSS1 laptop via the BSMM Multiplex Bus Synchronization Unit/computer.] In the US A/L (Airlock), Nespoli terminated the regeneration of the first two campout METOX Metal Oxide) canisters and started the process on the second set, #5 & #16.      [Recyclable METOX cans, with their absorbed CO2 “baked-out” in a hot oven, replaced the old one-way LiOH (Lithium Hydroxide) cartridges in EMUs and for A/L “campouts” in 2002.] In support of the JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), Cady Coleman unstowed three MYCO kits and distributed them to Mike Barratt, Paolo Nespoli & herself, followed by a joint review of the MYCO sampling procedures scheduled tomorrow morning.      [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO body samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss.] Dmitri Kondratyev started his 2nd session of the standard 24-hour ECG (Electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2 protocol.      [After 24 hrs of ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Dmitri will doff the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads and recorded on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results will then be downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data will be downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] At ~9:18am, Paolo powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 9:23am conducted a ham radio session with students at the Technological Centre for Innovation in Communications (CeTIC) Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in Las Palmas, Spain. At ~6:28pm, Cady will turn on the amateur radio gear and at 6:33pm conduct a ham radio session with students at Victory Primary School, Nelson, New Zealand. FE-1, FE-2 & FE4 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Dima at ~6:53am, Sasha at ~7:18am, Oleg at ~7:33am EST. At ~5:03pm, the ISS crew will receive a VIP call from President Obama at the White House.  Main subject of the exchange is expected to be the new role of the ISS as National Laboratory and its importance for science & technology research.       [Points to be covered may include the facts that currently more than 150 experiments are going on aboard space station, that control centers around the world in U.S., Europe, Japan, Canada and Russia are coordinating the research of hundreds of scientists around the globe, that the National Laboratory will dramatically cut the amount of time it takes to get research on the space station, and then to fly it again – getting to just six months, thus promoting the same iterative process that researchers use on Earth to test and retest their theories.  Also, the next Shuttle mission brings up the AMS-02 (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer) which could help unlock some mysteries of the universe, and students are getting opportunities to participate in research through projects like EarthKAM – in the new WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) – and Kids in Micro  (30 million students have already participated in ISS-linked educational activities), etc. etc.]  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1/2x, F-2/2x, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).        [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is done regularly after the last T2 session of the day.] Mated Reboost Update:   This morning’s reboost of the stack by the Shuttle VRCS (Vernier Reaction Control System) thrusters in Config 3 mode was on time and successful.  Mean orbital altitude of the ISS was lifted by 1.7 km (0.92 nmi.).  The burn had a duration of 26 min and produced a delta-V of 1.0 m/s (3.3 ft/s), exactly as predicted, boosting mean orbital altitude to 352.8 km, with 361.1 km apogee & 344.4 km perigee height of the slightly elliptical orbit.  Purpose of the reboost was to begin setting up phasing for STS-134/ULF6 launch and Soyuz 26S launch. Mission Extension:    Upon recommendation of the ISS Program Office the MMT (Mission Management Team) has made the decision to extend docked operation for an extra day (i.e., in addition to the earlier added day). Mission Timeline Look-Ahead:Mar 4 (FD 09) PMM outfittingMar 5 (FD 10) Extra day for PMM, stage get-aheads, etc.Mar 6 (FD 11) Final transfers, crew off duty time, hatch closureMar 7 (FD 12) Undock, flyaround, late inspection, OBSS berth Mar 8 (FD 13) Orbiter FCS checkout, RCS hot fire, cabin stowageMar 9 (FD 14) Deorbit and Landing (nominal landing). No CEO targets uplinked for today.
