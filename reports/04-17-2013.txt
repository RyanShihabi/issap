New Status:
Blood Pressure (BP) Regulation (Reg) Experiment: Hadfield set up the Human Research Facility (HRF) PFS (Pulmonary Function System) and the European Physiology Module (EPM) Cardiolab (CDL) Leg/Arm Cuff System (LACS) and conducted the first ever session of this experiment. Marshburn is scheduled to conduct the experiment Friday. The test will help to identify the astronauts who could benefit from countermeasures before returning to Earth. Thus, this method has great potential for astronaut health monitoring during future long-term space flights and it also has important implications for testing of individuals on Earth, especially the elderly, who are at risk for fainting. The research will also allow demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining a set of indicators of overall cardiovascular regulation from the non-invasive measurement of continuous blood pressure. 

Countermeasures System (CMS) Periodic Fitness Evaluation (PFE):  With assistance from Marshburn, Cassidy performed his first monthly physiological evaluation since arriving on orbit. The purpose of this activity is to monitor crewmembers’ overall fitness levels to ensure that cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health and performance is satisfactory. The activity consists of performing a graded exercise test on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS).

Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Walkoff to Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF)-1:   Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS, Cassidy then maneuvered the SSRMS into position and grappled Mobile Base System (MBS) PDGF1 as part of his proficiency for Robotics Operations. After MBS PDGF1 had been grappled, the Robotics Ground Controllers changed the SSRMS base from the Node 2 PDGF to MBS PDGF1. They then released the SSRMS from the Node2 PDGF and are currently maneuvering it to a translation configuration in preparation for the Mobile Transporter (MT) translation from Worksite (WS) 4 to WS2 planned for the end of this month.



EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Laptop Computer (ELC) Software Updates: Marshburn loaded EXPRESS Software Version 9.0, Basic Input/Output System (BIOS), Serial Network Flow Monitor (SNFM) software and configure the EXPRESS Rack-6 Laptop Computer (ELC) for operations. He configured and loaded Microgravity Experiment Research Locker/Incubator (MERLIN) and General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER) payload application software onto the ELC.
Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE): In preparation for tomorrow’s planned session, Cassidy will review crew operations procedures and setup procedure.




Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA) Water Sample: Hadfield retrieved a sample from the Water Processor Assembly (WPA) using the TOCA. He then recorded and transferred the data.
Amine Swingbed: The Amine Swingbed software load and valve cycling operations performed today by ground controllers at MCC-H and POIC (in Houston, TX and Huntsville, AL respectively) was successful.  Amine Swingbed has been deactivated nominally.  The next planned powered operations are scheduled for April 25th for a vacuum characterization.
Previous Status (04/16/13)
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Last night Robotics Ground Controllers powered up MSS and maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) into position to support a video survey of Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA)2. They used the SSRMS Tip Elbow Camera Light Pan/Tilt Assembly (CLPA) to perform the survey then maneuvered the SSRMS back to a park position. The purpose of the survey was to inspect the PMA2 sealing surface for contamination or possible Micro Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) damage prior to the installation of a cover this summer. Today the Mobile Transporter (MT) was translated from Worksite (WS) 5 back to WS4. MSS performance was nominal.

Synchronized Position, Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) Vertigo Experiment: Marshburn set up the camera, work area, and Vertigo Goggles, loaded the SPHERES and Goggles with test session specific programs and executed a session of the experiment. The experiment investigates the ability to create a three-dimensional model of an unknown object in space using only one or two small satellites. The experiment uses passive, visual cameras as the primary sensors to construct the model. These cameras have the advantage of being small and lightweight, as compared to current systems which rely on heavy and power-hungry laser or radio frequency (RF) systems.
Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS) Experiment: Cassidy performed the 3rd of 13 sessions planned for this experiment. BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity and will guide strategies for extinguishing fires in microgravity. BASS results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth.
Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR): Cassidy completed this activity that Marshburn started yesterday when he replaced the CIR Fuel Oxidizer Management Assembly (FOMA) Calibration Unit. Today Cassidy opened valves on all installed CIR Manifold Bottles and moved the Gas Interface Panel (GIP) Valve Lever to the up position to prepare for running test points after calibration of the FOMA system. This activity is required to renew the CIR Flight Safety Certification which expires in June of this year.
Countermeasures System (CMS) Periodic Fitness Evaluation (PFE):  Hadfield performed his monthly physiological evaluation, with assistance from Cassidy.  The purpose of this activity is to monitor crewmembers’ overall fitness levels to ensure that cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health and performance is satisfactory. The activity consists of performing a graded exercise test on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS).
Blood Pressure (BP) Regulation (Reg) Experiment: Hadfield set up the Human Research Facility (HRF) PFS (Pulmonary Function System) and the European Physiology Module (EPM) CDL (Cardiolab) LACS (Leg/Arm Cuff System) in support of BP Reg experiment. He will repeat this activity tomorrow. Marshburn is scheduled to conduct the experiment Thursday and Friday. The test will help to identify the astronauts who could benefit from countermeasures before returning to Earth. Thus, this method has great potential for astronaut health monitoring during future long-term space flights and it also has important implications for testing of individuals on Earth, especially the elderly, who are at risk for fainting. The research will also allow demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining a set of indicators of overall cardiovascular regulation from the non-invasive measurement of continuous blood pressure.
