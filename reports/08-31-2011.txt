ISS On-Orbit Status 08/31/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel. CDR Borisenko configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 5th, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] FE-4 Volkov inspected the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and verified proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.  Sergei also took documentary photography of setup & activities.         [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)], Afterwards, Volkov configured the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM window #9 for another sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), and later downloaded the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.      [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.] Samokutyayev conducted another data collection session for the psychological program MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”), accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Sasha’s 10th session with MBI-16.      [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] After FE-3 Garan had readied VCA2 (Video Camera Assembly 2) and a D2Xs digital camera in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum had ~6h20m for Day 3 of their IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of MARES (Muscle Atrophy Research & Exercise System), today troubleshooting its electronics equipment.       [During the Increment 23/24 MARES power verification activity, the Main Box had failed to power on nominally.  This on-orbit anomaly was duplicated on the ground by misaligning the electronics boxes.  Today’s troubleshooting activities involved partial disassembly of the electronics, inspecting connectors, and reinstalling the electronics in the Main Box while ensuring proper alignment.  Next, PIU (Power Interface Unit) and cabling was connected to support POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center/Huntsville) to run a power verification procedure.  Afterwards, the setup was torn down, the cabling disconnected and the MARES hardware stowed.     Background:   MARES is a dynamometer that will eventually be used for research on musculoskeletal, biomechanical, and neuromuscular physiology to better understand the effects of microgravity on the muscular system.  MARES hardware comprises an adjustable chair and human restraint system, a pantograph (an articulated arm supporting the chair, used to properly position the user), a direct drive motor, associated electronics and experiment programming software, a linear adapter that translates motor rotation into linear movements, and a vibration isolation frame.  It is capable of supporting measurements & exercise on seven different human joints, encompassing nine different angular movements, as well as two additional linear movements (arms and legs). It is considerably more advanced than current ground-based medical dynamometers (devices used to measure force or torque) and a vast improvement over existing ISS muscle research facilities.  MARES may be used together with an associated device called the PEMS II (Percutaneous Electrical Muscle Stimulator II).] Ron Garan set up the equipment for his next 24-hour urine collections under the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) NUTRITION/Repository protocol, scheduled tomorrow.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood & urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.] Later, Ron conducted a ~4h40m inventory/audit of grounding straps in the USOS (US Segment), checking racks for proper installation of these safety devices.       [Some time ago, ground straps were found incorrectly installed on the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) and MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2) racks.  Of the 44 electrically-connected racks in the USOS, good strap installation was identified for 32 of them while no photos were available for the remaining 12 racks.  Ron’s task today was to verify their configuration, preceded by a voltage measurement between the rack under audit and an adjacent rack with confirmed good grounding to ensure absence of a shock hazard.  Any voltage readings exceeding the specified limit as well as racks without a grounding strap were to be reported to MCC-Houston and the rack declared off limits for crew contact until further direction.]   FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness). Afterwards, Sasha conducted a 2h inventory/audit of Russian KRO food containers to verify stowage locations, conditions (open or closed), contents, and tape markings (green for regular, white for skip cycle).       [For the audit, Sasha referred to an uplinked summary listing 62 KRO containers stowed in FGB, MRM1 and the Descent Module (BO) of the Soyuz 27S spacecraft docked at MRM1.] Andrey Borisenko had ~2 hrs set aside for the periodic Russian SPOPT (Fire Detection & Suppression System) maintenance, today in the DC1 Docking Compartment, by dismantling its three IDZ-2 smoke detectors, cleaning their ionizing needles and then reinstalling the sensors.    [Part of the job is to inspect surrounding areas behind panels and to clean those surfaces and the inlet grille with microbial growth wipes.] The CDR also started Part 2 of the test series of the Russian ASN-M Satellite Navigation System, first equipping the RSK2 A31p laptop with the hard disk carrying the test application, then making cable connections between the laptop and the three active ASN navigation electronics modules NPM-1, NPM-3 & NPM-4 and activating the test program.       [Between now and 9/4, the CDR will be monitoring communications with NPM status every 2 hrs during work hours.  The objective of the test is to confirm that array configurations for ATV docking in negative Solar Beta angles do not create unacceptable multipathing for the RGPS (ASN) antennas.  The test is planned to be complete late Sunday evening.] Mike Fossum opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Ron Garan will close the shutters again.       [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light & infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.] Sergei Volkov had ~3h30m reserved for uninstalling the five VD1 & VD2 air ducts in the FGB and replacing them with new flexible air ducts.      [The two TsV1 & TsV2 ventilators were powered down before the R&R and turned on again afterwards.] FE-4 then completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sergei also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). At ~5:30am EDT, CDR Borisenko & FE-1 Samokutyayev used the SONY HVR-Z7E high-definition camcorder to shoot onboard video footage intended for viewing at the 9/9 Gala Concert dedicated to the 65th Anniversary of RSC Energia.      [Recorded scenes were to show a cosmonaut with a camcorder filming Earth at the Cupola, and views of Earth recorded with the zoom lens.]  At ~7:00am, Andrey, Sasha & Sergei supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking messages of greetings and well-wishing to three events:  (1) to “RussNeft” which celebrates its “Day of Workers of the Oil and Gas Industry” on 9/2;  (2)  to Russian school children for 9/1, the “Day of Knowledge” (the video will be posted on the Roskosmos website), and (3) to the citizens of the town of Borovsk, the regional center of the Kaluga area, who celebrate “Town Day” on 9/10.       [The town of Borovsk is closely related to the history of cosmonautics.  Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky, the founder of Russian cosmonautics, lived and taught in Borovsk for more than 12 years, before he was transferred to Kaluga.  Here in Borovsk he met his spouse; his children were also born here.  In Borovsk, he actively dealt with problems of aeronautics, designed a project of an all-metal airship, built the world’s first wind tunnel, and wrote a science-fiction novel “On the Moon” which describes which physical conditions would be encountered by people who get to the Moon.  In 1997, Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky’s house-museum was opened in Borovsk.  In 2007, 150 years after Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky’s birth, Borovsk was the only town where a monument to the founder of fundamental cosmonautics was opened.  In 2009, a monument was opened to Konstantin E. Tsiolkovsky’s teacher, N.F. Fedorov, a remarkable Russian philosopher, the founder of the Russian cosmism philosophy, who also used to live and teach in Borovsk. This year, a monument to Yuri A. Gagarin will be opened on Town Day in Borovsk.  Besides A.D. Artamonov, the governor of the Kaluga area, the citizens of Borovsk will be congratulated on Town Day by G.Yu. Gagarina, by Pilot-Cosmonaut V.A. Dzhanibekov, by ex-Ministers of rocket-and-space industry of the USSR and RF, O.D. Baklanov and V.V. Doguzhiev, and by representatives of the State Duma and Roskosmos.] Andrey also had ~1h for filming more “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY camcorder as part of the ongoing effort to create a photo & video documentary database on the flight of ISS-28 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] At ~4:15pm, Mike Fossum conducts another VHF-1 emergency communications proficiency check over NASA’s VHF (Very High Frequency) stations, today with the VHF sites at DRY/Dryden (4:19:12pm-4:27:09pm) and WHI/White Sands (4:20:46pm-4:28:28pm), for a voice check with Houston/Capcom, MSFC/PAYCOM (Payload Operation & Integration Center Communicator), Moscow/GLAVNI (TsUP Capcom), EUROCOM/Munich and JCOM/Tsukuba in the normal fashion via VHF radio from a handheld microphone and any of the USOS ATUs (Audio Terminal Units).     [Purpose of the test is to verify signal reception and link integrity, improve crew proficiency, and ensure minimum required link margin during emergency (no TDRS) and special events (such as a Soyuz relocation).] Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron turns on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] Shortly before sleep time, CDR Borisenko will set up the Russian MBI-12 Sonokard payload and start his 6th experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] FE-3, FE-5 & FE-6 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Ron at ~8:20am, Satoshi at ~1:05pm, Mike at ~2:25pm EDT. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-4). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Kwanza Basin (ISS approached this target in late morning light and fair weather.  As it crossed the Angolan coast from the SW, the crew was to look just left of track to document a thin string of new developments [infrastructure such as main roads, power lines, and settlements along the roads] between the capital city, Luanda, and new oilfields inland.  If the crew shot overlapping images for ~20 seconds they acquired images of these new developments.  Few usable images have yet been acquired, mainly due to the presence of continuous equatorial cloud), Volga - Ural Delta (ISS had a mid-afternoon pass in fair weather with the areas of interest for this target area near nadir.  As it tracked east-northeastward over the coastal waters of the northern Caspian Sea, the crew was to acquire overlapping frames to map the channels and wetlands of these delta systems), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (HMS Beagle Site:  Darwin and the Beagle arrived in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro, presently a city of more than 7 million, in April of 1832 and undertook an expedition inland.  ISS had a mid-morning pass with clear weather expected.  At this time as it tracked northeastward along the Brazilian coast, the crew was to look nadir and map the urban area around the prime visual cue, Guanabara Bay), Chisinau, Moldova (ISS had a mid-afternoon pass over this target in fair weather as it approached from the SW.  The Moldovan capital is located near the center of the country and inland about 120 miles from the northwestern coast of the Black Sea.  At this time the crew was to look near nadir for this urban area of nearly one million inhabitants), and Niwot Ridge Tundra, Colorado (ISS had a nadir view of this target area in early afternoon with fair weather anticipated.  This LTER [Long Term Ecological Research] site is located in north-central Colorado within the alpine areas above 3,000m just west of Boulder.  As ISS tracked northeastward over the Colorado Rockies, before reaching the plains to the east, the crew was to try for contextual mapping of the ridge and its surroundings). NOTE:  CEO routinely monitors significant tropical weather systems and newsworthy views globally, seeking what the CEO staff considers “best” opportunities for crew photography of such phenomena.  Dynamic Events such as fires, volcanic eruptions, auroras, and polar mesospheric clouds receive priority over the routine science payload targets.  With the passing of Irene, CEO staff has looked at both Jose, a weakening tropical storm, and, recently formed, the Tropical Depression #12.  Neither of these two offer viable opportunities at this time, but monitoring will continue.
