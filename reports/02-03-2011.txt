ISS On-Orbit Status 02/03/11  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.         FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O2 generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Before sleeptime, Oleg will inspect the filters again, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]  Paolo Nespoli continued his 3rd (FD60) suite of sessions with the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.      [For Pro K, there will be five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]  Nespoli also started his 3rd (FD60) HRF (Human Research Facility) Generic 24-hr urine collection period, with samples deposited in MELFI.  Later in the day, FE-5 set up the blood draw equipment, to be used tomorrow for his associated phlebotomy.     [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]  Also at wake-up, CDR Kelly, FE-5 Nespoli & FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 8th for Scott, the 9th for Cady & Paolo.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]  Before sleeptime, Cady takes documentary photos and video of crewmember performing RST.  FE-4 Kondratyev terminated his 5th experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]   Kelly serviced the DECLIC (Device for the Study of Critical Liquids & Crystallization) experiment in ER4 (EXPRESS Rack 4) by replacing the RHDD (Removable Hard Disk Drive) #005 in the DECLIC ELL (Electronics Locker) with a new one (#006).  Later, the CDR “degassed” two more CWC-Is (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine, #2052, #2055), to remove any free air bubbles that may have been ingested since its last use.  This has become necessary since the water in the bag is reaching its expiration date and needs to be used.     [The traditional procedure for “degassing” the container by first draining, then refilling it with a fully charged water CWC was replaced in 2004 by a rather ingenious new procedure developed and checked out on the KC-135 aircraft flying zero-G parabolas at JSC/Houston: Essentially, it involves the crewmember himself centrifuging the selected container by holding it away from the body and applying a slow rotation of ~15 rpm to himself, to separate air and water in the bag through centrifugal force, while simultaneously squeezing out the air by cinching down on bungee cords wrapped around the CWC.]  Afterwards, Scott conducted the monthly FDS PEP (Fire Detection & Suppression/Portable Emergency Provisions) safety inspection/audit in the ISS modules, including QDMAs (Quick-Don Mask Assembly).    [The 30-min IMS-supported inspection involves verification that PFEs (Portable Fire Extinguishers), PBAs, QDMAs and EHTKs (Extension Hose/Tee Kits) are free of damage to ensure their functionality, and to track shelf life/life cycles on the hardware (there are 1 PFE, 3 PBAs, 3 QDMAs, 1 EHTK in Node-1, 1 PFE, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs, 2 EHTKs in Node-2, 1 PFE, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs, 1 EHTK in Node-3, 1 PFE, 5 PBAs, 8 QDMAs in A/L, 2 PFEs, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs, 2 EHTKs in the Lab, 2 PFEs, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs in JPM, 1 PFE in JLP, 2 PFEs, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs in COL/Columbus Orbital Laboratory, and 1 PFE, 1 PBA, 1 QDMA I n HTV2).]  Skripochka concluded his 2nd session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2 protocol, started yesterday.  Kaleri initiated his 3rd session of the 24-hour PZE MO-2 protocol.     [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Oleg doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]  Later, FE-1 used the Russian KPT-12 payload with its BAR science instruments suite for about 2.5 hrs of taking ultrasound measurements with the AU ultrasound analyzer in the MRM1 Rassvet module, to identify sources of elevated background ultrasound in areas behind panels and recording background noise near the pressure shell.  Data were downlinked via OCA, and the activities were supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Later, Sasha initiated recharge of the Piren-B battery.    [Objective of the Russian KPT-12/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-B is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]  Oleg Skripochka deactivated the running Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9, downloaded the recorded session data for downlink and deinstalled the hardware.    [The FSS system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.]  Afterwards, Skripochka configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 3rd, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic & physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]  Later, Oleg used the standard ECOSFERA equipment, set up on 1/31, to continue the ongoing MedOps SZM-MO-21 microbial air sampling run, with the POTOK Air Purification System temporarily powered down, taking Kassetta no. 6 samples from cabin surfaces along with samples from crewmembers for sanitation and disease studies.  The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container and subsequently packed for return to Earth.     [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.]  Paolo worked with Kaleri on a checkout of the external KL-154 “Klest” TV camera from the ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) control panel (via Ku-band).     [The KL-154 video camera was installed outside the SM by Kornienko & Yurchikhin during their EVA-25 on 7/27/10.  It is located at the SM aft end facing backward (+X direction) to cover ATV rendezvous/docking operations.]  Oleg performed the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA.  Alex continued work on the BSPN Payload Server in SM, doing more software upgrading on the BSPN’s HDD (Hard Disk Drive) backup partition, supported by ground specialist tagup.  Working in the HTV2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 2), FE-5 Nespoli had several hours reserved for cargo transfer ops, focused today on transferring equipment from the internal standoff volumes which required moving racks.   In COL, Paolo set up the equipment for his and Cady’s 2nd in-orbit session with the ESA experiment NEUROSPAT (Study of Spatial Cognition, Novelty Processing and Sensorimotor Integration) in front of the EPM (European Physiology Module) rack, spread over three days: (1) hardware installation, (2) EEG (Electroencephalogram) cap setup & science data acquisition & stowage, and (3) data handling & final stowage.    [Laptops and EPM were not yet powered up. NeuroSpat investigates the ways in which crew members’ three-dimensional visual & space perception is affected by long-duration stays in weightlessness.  The Hungarian/Belgian experiment involves two principal experimental tasks: Visual Orientation and Visuomotor Tracking, plus additional, standardized EEG tasks performed as a means of assessing general effects of the space station environment on EEG signals. ]  Also in COL, Cady Coleman readied the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware including MBS (Mixing Bag System), and then conducted her 2nd session with the VO2max assessment, integrated with Thermolab.  After downloading the data to a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop, Cady powered down, cleaned up and fully stowed all equipment.       [The experiment VO2max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% & 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]  CDR Kelly performed another weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.     [The current card (26-0045F) lists 114 CWCs (2,248.6 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (20 CWCs with 761.0 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 476.1 L in 12 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 127.7 L in 4 bags for transfer into EDV-RP containers via US/RSA-B hose, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only; 2. potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (82 CWCs with 1,455.4 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (6.3 L in 1 bag to be used only for OGA, plus 9 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (25.9 L in 2 CWCs from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]  Scott also moved two temporarily deployed PCS (Portable Computer System) laptops back to their nominal positions, one from Node-3/Cupola UOP-1/Utility Outlet Panel 1) to COL (SUP 2/Standard Utility panel 2), the other from Lab (UOP-4) to US Airlock (UOP-1).  Later, the CDR worked on the CubeLab payload, first reviewing OBT (Onboard Training) material for installing/activating the frame of the CubeLab payload, reconfiguring CubeLab modules and setting up/stowing the CubeLab Microscope, then using the video camcorder to record documentary footage on CubeLab operations.  Later, Cube Modules were reconfigured inside CubeLab Frame 1002, and CubeLab was powered on before sleeptime.    [CubeLab is a low-cost 1-kg platform for educational projects.  It is a multipurpose research facility that interfaces small standard modules into the ERs (EXPRESS Racks).  The modules can be used within the pressurized space station environment in orbit, with a nominal length, width, and height of 100 mm and a mass of no more than 1 g.  Up to 16 CubeLab modules can be inserted into a CubeLab insert inside an ER.]  Oleg & Dmitri had another 2 hrs for unloading Progress 41P (#409) and transferring cargo to the ISS while updating the IMS (Inventory Management System) database.  Scott spent ~1.5 hrs on more unpacking of US cargo delivered by 41P.  Continuing her work on the Kobairo rack’s GHF(Gradient Heating Furnace) in JAXA’s Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Cady used the MultiMeter instrument to take resistance measurements of HU (Heating Unit) insulation material, then closed the GHF MP (Material processing) front panel which she had taken off yesterday.  Also on the Kobairo rack, Coleman installed a rubber shim on the VEE (Vacuum Evacuation Equipment), then took documentary photography.  Paolo & Cady filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]  Kondratyev & Skripochka completed the periodic (monthly) functional activation of the Vozdukh CO2 removal system’s AVK emergency vacuum valves and also the standard closure test of two spare AVKs from storage.  Vozdukh is part of the RS COA (Atmosphere Purification System).      [The AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO2 during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP).]  Sasha Kaleri completed the periodic Russian SPOPT (Fire Detection & Suppression System) maintenance, today in the DC1, by dismantling its IDZ-2 smoke detectors, cleaning their ionizing needles and then reinstalling the sensors.    [Part of the job is to inspect surrounding areas behind panels and to clean those surfaces and the inlet grille with microbial growth wipes.]  Dmitri Kondratyev worked in the Soyuz TMA-20/25S (#230, docked at MRM1), remedying the incorrect installation of a temperature sensor (DTG/датчик температуры) at the Console Logic Unit (BlP/blok logiki pul’ta) for the BVN Air Heater Fan in the Orbital Module (as revealed by ground inspection of Dima’s photography of 1/27).  FE-4 also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]  At ~5:10am EST, Nespoli conducted a tagup with the ESA staff at Col-CC at Oberpfaffenhofen/Germany.    [This conference is scheduled once every week, between ISS crewmembers and Col-CC via S/G2 (Space-to-Ground 2) audio.]  At ~12:05pm, Cady powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 12:10pm conducted a ham radio session with students at Adobe Bluffs Elementary School, San Diego, CA.  At ~12:35pm, Kelly had his regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.  At ~2:20pm, Scott reported on HTV2 transfer ops in a teleconference with ground specialists.  SPDM Operations:   At 1:30pm–12:45am, ground controllers are using the SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) “Dextre” to extract two NASA payloads from the HTV2’s EP (Exposed Pallet), i.e. (1) the FHRC (Flex Hose Rotary Coupler) with Arm 1 for stowage on the SPDM’s EOTP (Enhanced ORU Temporary Platform), and (2) the CTC (Cargo Transport Container) with Arm 2 with subsequent handover to Arm 1 which then grasps the CTC Hinge Fixture and applies CTC heater power through the SPDM umbilical.  Finally, the SSRMS will be maneuvered to an MT (Mobile Transporter) Translate configuration in preparation for tomorrow’s ground ops.  Russian thrusters are disabled during the operations due to load constraints.  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1,FE-2,).  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded today were Asmara, Eritrea (ISS had a nadir pass in mid-morning light for this target with approach from the NW.  This capital city of nearly 600,000 is situated on the inland side of the coastal mountains of Eritrea.  Using the long lens setting for this small, low-contrast target and simply performing a nadir mapping strip to acquire it), Bosumtwi Impact Crater, Ghana (this has been a very challenging target for crews to acquire due to frequent cloud cover and ever-present haze or dust.  The late morning approach of ISS was from the NW with fair weather expected.  The crater is a little hard to locate because of its proximity to a much larger and more visually attractive feature, Lake Volta.  This impact crater is located about 150 km west of the south end of Lake Volta in south central Ghana.  It is a very young impact [just over a million years old], about 10.5 km in diameter, and almost completely filled by a lake.  Looking nadir for a circular lake just southeast of the urban area of Kumasi.  Overlapping frames were requested), and Ascension Island, Atlantic Ocean (Ascension has a history of association with space-based activities – particularly as a communications and satellite-tracking hub.  Scattered clouds may have been present in the vicinity of the island on this midday pass.  There were no visual cues for this small, remote feature as ISS approached from the NW, so at this time the crew was to look nadir to try and spot the island.  Overlapping mapping frames of the island were requested.
