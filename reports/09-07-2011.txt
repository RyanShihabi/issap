ISS On-Orbit Status 09/07/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, Alex Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel.     [The crew has reported numerous instances of a spurious C&W tone early in the morning, and the daily PSS test is being suspected as cause.  A dedicated series of SM tests will be performed with the crew listening for the tone in their CQs (Crew Quarters).] CDR Borisenko, FE-1 Samokutyayev & FE-4 Volkov conducted the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Andrey, Aleksandr & Sergei were joined by FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device set up (and later stowed away) by Volkov.      [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ] Andrey, Sasha & Ron then spent another 30 min on a fit check of their Kentavr anti-G suits for their return to Earth on Soyuz 26S on 9/16, followed by a PMC (Private Medical Conference) with a Kentavr specialist via S-band.       [The “Centaur” garment (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Chibis" lower body negative pressure suit) is a protective anti-G suit ensemble to facilitate the return of a long-duration crewmember into the Earth gravity.  Consisting of shorts, gaiters, underpants, jersey and socks, it acts as countermeasure for circulatory disturbance, prevents crewmember from overloading during descent and increases orthostatic tolerance during post-flight adaptation.  Russian crewmembers are also advised to ingest fluid-electrolyte additives, viz., three sodium chloride tablets during breakfast and after the midday meal, each time with 300 ml of fluid, and two pills during the meal aboard Soyuz before deorbit.]  Borisenko performed his 4th preliminary (predvariteljnaya) ODNT orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test run with the Russian Chibis suit in preparation for his return to gravity on 9/16 (along with Sasha Samokutyayev & Ron Garan).  Andrey conducted the exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure ODNT device (US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the T2/COLBERT treadmill, assisted by Andrey Borisenko as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) and supported by ground tagup via VHF at 4:10am-4:34am EDT.   Afterwards, Sasha also underwent his 4th preliminary ODNT run, assisted by Andrey and ground tagup at 6:45am-7:03am.        [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by one cycle of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, today set at -25, -30, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG SHKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] FE-3 Garan installed the lower crew restraints (left & right) at the WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) rack in the US Lab.     [WORF, designed for the high-quality Lab science window, is based on an ISPR (International Standard Payload Rack), utilizing avionics & hardware adapted from the ER (EXPRESS Rack) program.  With a payload volume equivalent to 0.8 m3, the rack supports up to three payloads simultaneously, depending on available resources and space available at the window.  WORF also provides access & equipment for crew Earth observations, such as crew restraints, camera/camcorder brackets and condensation prevention.  Its payloads focus on geology, agriculture, ranching, environmental & coastal changes, and education.] FE-6 Fossum powered on the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) and VPC (Video Power Converter) hardware in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), connected VPC to HRF (Human Research Facility) Rack 1, and performed the SPRINT leg muscle self scan with remote guidance from the ground team.       [Before the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) session, Mike performed an abbreviated data export from the USND-2 hard drive to the HRF PC1 USB drive to support the ground in establishing communications between USND-2 & HRF.  He then performed his FD90 (Flight Day 90) SPRINT scan, powered off the hardware, decabled the VPC from HRF Rack 1, and stowed the hardware.  Fossum is currently following a special experimental “SPRINT” protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5hrs per day regime and introduces special daily sessions.  No exercise will be timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Mike picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] FE-5 Furukawa started another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] FE-4 Volkov ended the overnight (10-hr) charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery for the Piren-V Pyro-endoscope, part of the Russian BAR science instruments suite (other BAR components being the ТТМ-2 Anemometer-Thermometer, the charger cable, and the video display unit).  Sergei then started the charging process on the TTM-2 battery, to be terminated after ~9 hrs.      [Piren-V, a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, is part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Besides Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] Other activities completed by Volkov included –The daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and ensured proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules;   [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)],Copying science & service data of the GFI-17 Molniya-GAMMA experiment, mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28, from the BSPN Payload Server to the RSS1 laptop, after checking out proper MKSD Control & Data Acquisition Module communications between BSPN and RSS1;   [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity],Initiating, on Go-ahead from TsUP-Moscow, another refresh of the ISS interior with an O2 repress from Progress M-10M/42P (#410) tankage, with the Russian Elektron oxygen generator currently off,Working in the MRM1 “Rassvet” module to replace the TVU-2 Terminal Computing Device monoblock of the BVS computer system;  [this is part of on-going troubleshooting of MRM1 telemetry which has not been received on the ground for the last 3 days],Installing new software on the RSS1 laptop for the Russian SLS Laser Communication System’s Onboard Laser Communication Terminal (BTLS), followed by a communications checkout with a Ping test between the RSS1 and the BSPN Payload Server,Spending ~2 hrs in the MRM2 “Poisk” module on the periodic Russian SPOPT (Fire Detection & Suppression System) maintenance by dismantling its three IDZ-2 smoke detectors, cleaning their ionizing needles and then reinstalling the sensors; [part of the job is to inspect surrounding areas behind panels and to clean those surfaces and the inlet grille with microbial growth wipes], andThe routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM;  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] After yesterday’s stowage “deconflicting” (making room) for the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) in the COL, Satoshi Furukawa set up the SLAMMD equipment and used it for determining his body mass, followed in suit by Ron Garan and then Mike Fossum.  Afterwards, Mike took the device down for stowing it and then also returned the stowage goods which had been temporarily “deconflicted”. Sasha Samokutyayev set up the Russian TEKh-38 VETEROK (“Breeze”) science hardware and then used it to take air ion concentration measurements twice during the day in the MRM1, MRM2 and SM in the middle section and near the transfer hatches of the modules.  Data were taken in two blocks of 1h30m each with a break of ~4 hrs in between and entered on log sheets.      [Objective: to optimize atmospheric gas parameters in MRM1 by operating the Veterok air-cleaning fan for 1.5 hrs without generation of air ions, then for another 1.5 hrs with generation of air ions.  Veterok uses an air scrubber fan (VOV), air ion concentration meter (IKAR-1) and anemometer-thermometer (TAN-1) for measuring charged particles at various locations near the running VOV.  The experiment studies the implementation of alternative methods for cleaning & revitalizing the atmosphere by pumping the air with an electrostatic fan through an electric filter and saturating the airflow with light air ions of positive and negative polarity, which may solve the problem of removing organic trace contaminants from the air, both in the entire station volume and in the space behind the panels.  Measurements were taken with IKAR-1 and TAN-1 of particle field polarity (plus/minus), concentration, temperature & velocity and downloaded to the RSE-1 laptop.] Andrey Borisenko used the SONY HVR-Z7E camcorder to record video footage of Sasha’s TEKh-38 VETEROK activities in MRM1, MRM1 & SM for the Russian “Chronicles” project on the flight of ISS-28 for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz & Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.] Satoshi & Mike took the (approx.) monthly O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test each, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.      [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There has been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.] FE-6 Fossum conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.       [The current card (28-0014L) lists 131 good CWCs (3,044.5 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (31 CWCs with 1,285.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 978.9 L in 24 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 263.2 L in 6 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. Iodinated water (88 CWCs with 1,591.4 L (also 19 expired bags with 345.4 L);  4. condensate water (130.9 L in 8 bags, plus 2 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (37.0 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Later, Mike had 1h10m set aside to relocate BME (Biomed Engineering) cargo to locations specified on an uplinked list and unpacked a CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag) left over from ULF-5. With the G1 HD camcorder set up in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) for downlinking his activity, FE-5 conducted another EPO (Education Payload Activity) session with LEGO BRICKS, building a Lego Space Shuttle from a guide book. Also in the JAXA JPM, Satoshi continued the activation & checkout (commissioning) of the MSPR (Multi Purpose Small Payload Rack).     [Satoshi first powered up MSPR components, i.e., the VRU (Video Recording Unit)/Hub, MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) & MSPR laptop, then checked out the end-to-end IEEE1394 communication between the ground and the MSPR WV (Work Volume), followed by a ping test of the LAN (Local Area Network) connection from the MSPR laptop to PLT2 (Payload Laptop 2) at the WV and SEA (Small Experiment Area), LEHX (Layer 2 Ethernet Hub & Multiplexer), MSPR VRU and MSPR MPC.] Ron Garan broke out and set up the hardware for the INTEGRATED IMMUNE saliva samplings, to be collected of Mike, Satoshi & himself every other day for six days, scheduled to start tomorrow.        [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] In the Lab, Ron performed a manual shutdown of the GLACIER 2 (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezer in ER6 (EXPRESS Rack 6) in bay O4, using the front panel.  In Node-3, FE-3 also worked on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, using a payload A31p laptop to reactivate the secondary channel for the T2 PAU (Power Avionics Unit) using SSPCM (Solid State Power Control Module) software.     [This allows for higher speeds when running.] In the SM, CDR Borisenko relabeled KURS-P LF & HF cables to reflect their subsequent reconfiguration/switch from -Y to +Y axis orientation.     [-Y axis is pointing to DC1.]    Afterwards, Andrey switched the antenna feeder cables of the KURS-P (passive) automated radar approach & docking system to the K2-VKA instrumentation unit in the SM from SM +Y port to SM –Y (nadir) port where the DC-1 is docked.      [The mating of LF (low frequency) and HF (high frequency) antenna feeder cables of the KURS-P system will support vehicle dockings at the DC-1 “Pirs” module.  KURS is the automated radar approach & docking system on the Russian Soyuz & Progress vehicles, with the active (KURS-A) component in the visiting vehicles and the passive transponder/repeater-type KURS-P component in the SM.] Sasha did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Mike performed regular maintenance calibration on the sensors of the two CSA-O2 (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1046 & #1059. Andrey, Sasha & Ron each had time set aside for personal crew departure preparations; these are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers. Satoshi serviced the ARED workout machine, performing periodic maintenance by evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration. FE-3, FE-5 & FE-6 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Ron at ~7:25am, Satoshi at ~10:35am, Mike at ~12:35pm EDT. At ~4:15am, FE-5 Furukawa conducted the regular tagup with the Japanese Flight Control Team at SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center)/Tsukuba via S-band/audio.     [This conference is scheduled once every week, between the ISS crewmembers and SSIPC.] Before “Presleep” period tonight, Garan turns on the MPC and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Ron will turn MPC off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-1).     [No workout sessions reported for Ron Garan.  Mike Fossum is currently following a special experimental “SPRINT” protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5hrs per day regime and introduces special daily sessions.  No exercise will be timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Mike picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] A task listed for Andrey, Sergei & Sasha on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today continues to be the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). ARED Troubleshooting:   Ground analysis has identified the AIB (ARED Instrumentation Box) as apparent culprit of the ARED Display failure.  Exercising can continue on the device.  Manifesting another AIB is under consideration.. SPDM Update:   Overnight, Robotics controllers on the ground have maneuvered the SSRMS/SPDM (Space Station Remote Manipulator System/Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) to remove the launch locks on the RRM (Robotic Refueling Mission) payload and to stow the RMCT (Robot Micro Conical Tool), then configured the SSRMS/SPDM for the RRM Vision Test operations planned for tonight.  For dynamic load reasons, Russian thrusters will again be disabled from 4:00pm to 5:00am tomorrow morning.  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Dushanbe, Tajikistan (this capital city with a population nearing 750,000 is located in an agricultural area of the western part of the country at the confluence of the Varzob and Kofarnihon Rivers.  Looking nadir for the city), Amman, Jordan (the Jordanian capital of about 2 million sprawls over a high, desert plateau just northeast of the Dead Sea.  Looking left of track for this ancient city), Tripoli, Libya (this capital city of 1.69 million has been occupied since its founding in the 7th century BC. It lies on a gentle bulge in the Libyan coastline.  Looking left of track), Hurricane Katia, Atlantic Ocean (Hurricane Katia is expected to be a Category 3 hurricane with winds of 125 mph at the time of the ISS orbital pass.  It is still projected to make a turn to the NNW tomorrow and Friday and avoid hitting the U.S. east coast.  Looking left of track for Katia), and Texas Wildfires (Dynamic Event:  Looking right of track for one major and several numerous Texas wildfires.  The major fire is located in Bastrop, just east of Austin.  While it was hoped that Tropical Storm Lee would drop much needed rain on Texas, for the most part it did not.  Instead it brought in high winds and low humidity that exacerbated Texas drought conditions.  According to some sources, since December, wildfires in Texas have consumed 3.6 million acres of Texas [an area roughly the size of Connecticut).  Visible satellites show long plumes of smoke oriented roughly from north to south in Bastrop and the area to the north of Houston, south of Huntsville, southeast of Bryan [Montgomery and Grimes counties].  The fires in Bastrop are not contained, but it was hoped that by the time the crew read this they were).
