Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: In preparation for tomorrow’s US EVA #51 Node 2 External Wireless Communications (EWC), the crew finalized their EVA tool configurations and completed an audit of EVA equipment.  After a final review of the EVA briefing package, the crew participated in an EVA Procedures Conference, configured the Robotics Work Stations (RWSs), and readied the Equipment Lock and EMUs for tomorrow morning’s EVA activities.  EV hatch opening is scheduled at ~7:05 AM CDT Thursday morning. 
Grip:  The crew completed the third of three Grip operations in the supine position. ESA’s Grip investigation tests how the nervous system takes into account the forces due to gravity and inertia when manipulating objects.  Results from this investigation may provide insight into potential hazards for astronauts as they manipulate objects in different gravitational environments, support design and control of haptic interfaces to be used in challenging environments such as space, and provide information about motor control that will be useful for the evaluation and rehabilitation of impaired upper limb control in patients with neurological diseases.  
Electromagnetic Levitator (EML):  The crew installed a new sample and process chamber in the EML today. Valves were opened between the two chambers. The EML is a multi-user facility is designed for containerless materials processing in space. It supports research in the areas of meta-stable states and phases along with the measurement of high-accurate thermophysical properties of liquid metallic alloys at high temperatures.
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID):  The crew installed 11 RFID Logistics marker tags in Nodes 2 and 3 today.  RFID Logistics aims to utilize RFID enabled tags on hardware throughout the ISS to assist in the tracking of the hardware as it is moved around the ISS.
