07-25-2012July 24, 2012ISS On-Orbit Status 07/25/12All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     At wakeup, Sergei Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-3 Acaba set up & powered on the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) and VPC (Video Power Converter) hardware, connected VPC to ER-8 (EXPRESS Rack 8), powered on the hardware.  Joe then became the subject for his 2nd ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Exercise Echo Scan in the US Lab, assisted by Sunita Williams, serving as Operator/CMO (Crew Medical Officer) operating the USND (Ultrasound) scans after setting up the equipment and powering it on. Joe later downloaded the data and restowed the gear.   [ICV Echo Scan sessions are done with a resting period or with a CEVIS exercise period.  Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable & VOX, Joe underwent the USND scan for ICV assessment, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera. Heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor). There are dietary constraints, and no exercise is allowed 4 hrs prior to scan. After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed. Later, the data from the two HM-2 (Holter Monitor 2) HiFi Cards and two Actiwatch Spectrums were transferred from the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) hard drive to the USND-2 USB drive. Voice required last 5 minutes for crew to inform ground copy process is complete. The USND echo experiment uses the Image Collector software on the laptop and requires VOX/Voice plus RT Video downlink during the activity. Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms. The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session. The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).]FE-6 Hoshide had Day 4 of his first (FD15) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections. After recording his diet input today, Akihiko completed the final series of urine samplings, and then set up the equipment for tomorrow�s associated generic blood draw. [The operational products for blood & urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities. Generic blood & urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated. Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement. Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]In COL, for his on-going first Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) assessment, Akihiko reached midpoint at about 11:10am EDT, after which he began the second 24h data collection period, with Makita batteries swapped and recharged during the day. [For the second 24 hr period, the Cardiopres was temporarily doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery were changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours. After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink. The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). (ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.)]FE-2 Revin started a new round of monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems.     [In the DC1 Pirs module, Sergei changed out the PF1 & PF2 dust filter cartridges and cleaned the V1 & V2 fan screens, the VD1 &VD2 air ducts and the V3 fan screen.]Yuri Malenchenko completed his first session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop. [CDR Padalka stood by to assist Yuri in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit plus taking documentary photography. Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm. MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes. The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the L�scher test, �adaptive biological control� training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris. The L�scher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate. It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms. An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]FE-5 Williams conducted Part 2 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the RS (Russian Segment) crew, i.e., Gennady, Sergei & Yuri, for a 24-hr data take.FE-2 Revin made preparations for another round of inspection & photography of RS windows and their current condition.In the SM, Padalka demated an EKTS (Integrated Command & Telemetry System) video cable and connected it to the WAS1 antenna of the MBRL/PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment).Later, the CDR performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM. [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]Gennady also took care of the daily IMS maintenance from the discretionary �time permitting� task list, updating/editing its standard �delta file� including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).Sergei collected the periodic air samples for return to Earth, using a Russian AK-1M absorber in the SM for air, plus IPD-CO Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (Carbon Monoxide).Afterwards, Revin, with Padalka�s initial assist, had ~2 hrs for replacing the SD1-7 lighting fixtures in the DC1 Docking Compartment.FE-3 Acaba reviewed uplinked HTV3 cargo transfer list and later, at ~10:40am, was joined by Sunita and Akihiko for an HTV3 cargo transfer conference with ground personnel.Gennady performed the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWCs (Contingency Water Containers) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron�s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container. Once filled, the EDV is connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit. [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.]Later, Padalka completed standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 �Identifikatsiya� (Identification) in MRM1, downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA. [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed inPGO behind panel 104.]The CDR also recharged the battery of the RS3 laptop.Before sleeptime, Gennady set up the battery of the GFI-1 �Relaksatsiya� (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment for overnight charging. [By means of the GFI-1 UFK �Fialka-MV-Kosmos� ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3. �Relaxation�, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]Padalka, Malenchenko, Williams & Hoshide joined for the 1h 50m OBT (Onboard Training) drill of familiarizing themselves with Integrated Emergency Hardware, which was then followed by a 10-min tagup with ground specialists.Joe Acaba had ~2 hrs set aside to conduct a Photosynch Mapping session, i.e., taking special shorts with the NIKON D2Xs camera to map the interior of the station (with no personal articles in sight).Yuri & Aki had another hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.Suni & Joe had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.[Required are three journaling sessions per week.]Before Presleep, FE-3 turned on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link). After about an hour, Joe turned MPC routing off again. [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]All six crewmembers had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Aki at ~5:45am, Yuri at ~9:40am, Suni at ~11:15am, Sergei at ~12:40pm, Gennady at ~12:55pm, Joe at ~2:45pm EDT.Before exercising on the ARED advanced resistive device, Williams set up and checked out the G1 video camera for it to record her, Gennady�s, Joe�s & Aki�s workout session on the machine, meeting the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status. Afterwards, the video footage was stowed by Sergei.The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). Tasks listed for Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary �time permitting� job for today were �A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia�s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
