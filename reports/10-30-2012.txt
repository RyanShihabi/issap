ISS On-Orbit Status 10/30/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko & FE-2 Tarelkin, as a handover, performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection and completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 & RSS2 laptops CDR Williams, FE-6 Hoshide & FE-3 Ford started the day with another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, Suni’s 34th, Aki’s 35th, Kevin’s 1st.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] Before breakfast and other Postsleep activities, FE-1 Novitskiy set up the Russian spectrometry experiment MBI-28 Xromatomass (Chromatomass) and conducted his 1st session of collecting saliva and blood. MBI-28 was closed out afterwards. FE-2 Tarelkin had ~3 hrs reserved to perform his 1st session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.  Yuri Malenchenko assisted with the gear and took documentary photo/video.      [Evgeny donned the electrode cap, prepared the head for the electrodes, and applied electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] After Kevin Ford configured the necessary equipment, future spacewalkers Sunita Williams & Akihiko Hoshide both underwent the HMS PHS (Health Maintenance System / Periodic Health Status) pre-EVA evaluation, with Kevin assisting by acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer)/operator for both. Later, Williams printed out an uplinked document with latest EVA-20 procedures.    [EVA-20, planned on Thursday, 11/1, will start at ~8:10am EDT with hatch opening and last about 6h 30m. The outboard activities by Suni (EV1) & Aki (EV2) will focus exclusively on the 2B power channel and the ammonia leak in the P6 truss. The data shows the leak in the loop has accelerated, and that channel could be off-line by the end of the year if the leak trend continues. Spacewalk activities include EAS (Early Ammonia System) jumper reconfigurations, demating the FQDC (Flight Quick Disconnect Coupling) of the 2B PVR (Photovoltaic Radiator), removal & stowage of the TTCR Trailing Thermal Control Radiator) shroud, plus release & deployment of the stowed TTCR radiator, with photography of IEA (Integrated Equipment Assembly) and PVR.]  At ~10:00am EDT, Williams, Hoshide & Ford conducted a 30-min teleconference via audio/video with EVA-20 specialists on the ground to discuss particulars. Joined by Kevin for handover, Aki prepared the NIKON D2Xs cameras for the spacewalk, setting them up with a 28mm and a 50mm lens, resp., marking the second one with a Kapton tape at the hand strap and then stowing both temporarily in Node-1. FE-1 Novitskiy & FE-2 Tarelkin had ~40 min set aside to familiarize themselves with the IUS BKS Auxiliary Computer System laptops in the RS (Russian Segment), supported by ground specialist tagup (S-band).[The current laptop complement in the RS comprises:·        RSS1 (T61p):  Support computer , stays on 24 hrs; monitoring BRI and SM WAP, SW for BSPN, LF Data Receiver (BPI NU);·        RSS2 (T61p): Support computer, stays on 24 hrs; communication with BSR-ТМ, RSPI, Sigma, photo/video processing SW;·        RSE-Med (A31p): Medical experiments; not on network;·        RSE1 (T61p): Relaksatsiya, BAR and others; SW for Photo/video processing; not on network;·        RSK1 (T61P): Simulators ATV, TORU, RUS, Tipologiya Experiment; Sigma, SW for photo/video processing;·        RSK2 (T61P): ТК telemetry via SPR-TMI; Sigma, SW for photo/video processing;·        RSE-LCS (A31p): Deactivated until activity is resumed; SLS tests (Laser Communication System); US T61p Laptops in RS:·        SSC2: Central Post – US Network Support, MCC-H·        SSC1: port CQ (Crew Quarters)·        SSC3: starboard CQ;·        CSL5: Crew Support Laptop; Internet support; MCC-H·        CSL6: Crew Support Laptop; Internet support; MCC-H.] Yuri reviewed & studied an uplinked stowage list for return & disposal cargo to be stowed on the Soyuz TMA-05M/31S (#706) spacecraft, docked at MRM1 Rassvet. Suni conducted another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.      [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] In Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), loc. D4, Aki prepared MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) for future sample storage by inserting 16 ice bricks (white) at +4 degC into Dewar 4, Trays A-D, swapping two ¼-box modules for one ½-box module. Afterwards, Hoshide performed the periodic reboot of the JAXA SLT (System Laptop) in the JPM. In preparation of Progress M-17M/49P (#417) docking at the SM aft port (+X-axis; SM -Y-axis is to nadir) tomorrow morning (~9:40am EDT, assuming successful 4-orbit rendezvous), Oleg & Yuri worked through the standard 3-hr refresher training for the TORU teleoperator system, which provides a manual backup mode to the Progress’ KURS automated rendezvous radar system.  A tagup with a TORU instructor at TsUP/Moscow via S-band audio supported the training which used the simulation application on the RSK1-T61p.      [The drill included procedure review, rendezvous, docking data and rendezvous math modeling data review, fly-around, final approach, docking and off-nominal situations (e.g., video or comm loss).  Three different flight conditions were simulated on the RSK1 laptop.  The TORU teleoperator control system lets a SM-based crewmember perform the approach and docking of automated Progress vehicles in case of KURS failure.  During spacecraft approach, TORU is in “hot standby” mode.  Receiving a video image of the approaching ISS, as seen from a Progress-mounted docking television camera (“Klest”), on a color monitor (“Simvol-Ts”, i.e. “symbol center”) which also displays an overlay of rendezvous data from the onboard digital computer, the crewmember would steer the Progress to mechanical contact by means of two hand controllers, one for rotation (RUO), the other for translation (RUD), on adjustable armrests.  The controller-generated commands are transmitted from the SM's TORU control panel to the Progress via VHF radio.  In addition to the Simvol-Ts color monitor, range, range rate (approach velocity) and relative angular position data are displayed on the “Klest-M” video monitor (VKU) which starts picking up signals from Progress when it is still approximately 9 km away.  TORU is monitored in real time from TsUP over RGS (Russian Ground Sites) and via Ku-band from Houston, but its control cannot be taken over from the ground.   Tomorrow, assuming a successful 4-orbit rendezvous after 49P launch (3:41am EDT). Progress KURS-A (active) will be activated at 8:01am EDT on Daily Orbit 4 (DO4), SM KURS-P (passive) two minutes later.  VHF (UKV-2d) and Progress video will be switched on at a range of ~9 km, the same as Progress floodlight.  Progress TORU will be activated from the ground at 3 km range. Sunrise: 9:07am.  Flyaround to the SM aft port (~400 m range, in sunlight) starts at 9:15am, followed by station keeping at 170m at ~9:24am.  Start of final approach: ~9:30am (DO5) in sunlight, contact at SM aft port: ~9:40am.  SM Kurs-P is deactivated on mechanical capture.  Sunset: ~10:11am.] In Node-3, Akihiko completed routine maintenance on the WRS (Water Recovery System), taking water samples for analysis in the TOCA, after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose with water from the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) and buffer solution from the BC.      [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] In the US Lab, Williams checked the manual water valve position on the MELFI-3 Rack (loc. S1) for POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center/Huntsville).     [Determining the current position of the valve behind LTL (Low Temperature Loop) hoses required temporary opening of a closeout panel, taking photographs and later reporting valve position and SSC (Station Support Computer) location of the photos to POIC.] Yuri Malenchenko conducted his 3rd onboard session of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (“Study of the Veins in the Lower Extremities”), using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex with orthogonal leads.     [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Yuri set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump & valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a “body box”) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).] FE-4 also verified proper function of the deployed Russian “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2) radiation detectors by taking readings and checking date/time from the LULIN-5 electronics box located in the MRM1 near the spherical “phantom”.     [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (dosimeters A41, A42, A43, A44, A45, A46, A47, A48) are deployed in the RS). The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.] FE-2 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Evgeny also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). With Malenchenko providing guidance for knowledge handover, Novitskiy & Tarelkin undertook the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from 3 CWCs (Contingency Water Containers, #1043, #1087, #1088) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV is connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.] In another handover activity, Yuri & Oleg activated and took measurements with the Russian BAOK GANK-4M Real-Time Monitoring Analyzer unit for measuring concentration of harmful contaminants in the air of the RS.    [The BAOK gas analyzer, a subsystem of the SKDS Pressure Control & Atmosphere Monitoring System, determines concentrations of CH4 (methane), NH3 (ammonia), CO (carbon monoxide), HCN (hydrogen cyanide), HF (hydrofluoric acid) and NO2 (nitric oxide) from air samples using electrochemical sensors, with measurements displayed on LCD (liquid crystal display) and stored on tapes. The assessment is done monthly and after each arrival of a new spacecraft and GANK-4M analyzer unit.] Also as another handover, Malenchenko & Tarelkin completed the periodic checkout & performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] FE-1, FE-2, FE-3 & FE-4 had their standard post-launch PMCs (Private Medical Conferences, via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Kevin at ~11:15am, Evgeny at ~11:30am, Yuri at ~1:15pm, Oleg at ~2:00pm EDT. FE-1 & FE-2 again had an hour of free time each for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. Before Presleep (~3:40pm), Williams will power up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~8:40am EDT, Ford supported a PAO TV downlink, responding to interviews with the Associated Press (Marcia Dunn) and the Weather Channel (Mike Bettes or TBD). At ~11:55am, Aki powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and conducted a ham radio session with students at South Florida Science Museum, West Palm Beach, FL. At ~12:15pm, Suni used the SM's amateur radio equipment to conduct a ham radio session with students at Southern Tier Catholic and Archbishop, Olean, NY. At ~1:30pm, Kevin used the SM's amateur radio equipment to hold a ham radio session with students at Cumberland Elementary School, West Lafayette, IN. The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2).     [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed T2 (int., 30 sec.), with ARED/CEVIS (cont.), EVA, and T2 (int., 4 min.) for the next 3 days. Aki’s protocol for today showed T2 (int., 4 min.), with ARED/CEVIS, EVA and no exercise on the following 3 days.] After his SPRINT workout on the T2 machine, Aki will close down the treadmill software on its laptop for data transfer, then turn off the T2 display.     [After the display shutdown, the T2 rack is power cycled (turned off/on) from the ground, and T2 is then ready for use.  These power cycles allow for the T2 data to be transferred to the Server for downlink.]  Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andA ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) to record target sites on the Earth surface, and Conjunction Notice:     Flight controllers are tracking a repeating conjunction with object 34533 (Iridium 33 Debris). They are following a total of six close approaches from 10/31, 9:20pm EDT, through 11/1, 5:04am. This is a small, high drag object which makes tracking updates difficult and provides a very high prediction uncertainty. NASA and Russian ballistics experts currently are evaluating DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) options based on the earliest TCA (Time of Closest Approach) at 10/31, 9:20pm, which places the prime DAM option tomorrow at 6:58pm EDT.  The DAM would be performed with the DC1 Progress midring thrusters, with a preliminary delta-v of 0.5 m/s and burn duration of about 7 minutes.  This burn would occur about 9 hrs after the planned Progress 49P docking to SM aft and about 5 hrs before the planned ISS attitude maneuver to +YVV in support of EVA-20 on 11/1. CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  ISS had a midday pass in clear weather with approach from the SW. This capital city of at least 1.25 million with its grid-like pattern is located in the fertile and agriculturally active Chui River Valley near the country’s northern border with Kazakhstan. At this time, as ISS tracked over the northern Pamir Mountains, the crew was to begin looking towards nadir for this urban area well south of Lake Balkhash), Damascus, Syria (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  The Syrian capital with a population estimated a 1.8 million is located in the extreme southwestern part of the country on an arid plateau area about 50 miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea. ISS pass was in late morning light with clear weather expected. At this time, the crew was to begin aiming near nadir to slightly left of the track for this low-contrast urban area on the western edge of an area of intensive agriculture, trying to capture the entire area in a single frame), Georgetown, Guyana (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  ISS had an early morning, fair weather pass for this capital city with approach from the SW. Georgetown with its population estimated at 250,000 is located near the Atlantic coast on the east bank of the Demerara River estuary. At this time as ISS approached the coast and the small estuary of the Demerara, the crew was to shoot just left of track and try for detailed views of this small urban area), Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (LONG TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH SITE [LTER]: This study area is a barrier island and marsh complex located on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island and the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the United States. ISS had a mid-morning pass in clear weather and below normal tides due to Hurricane Sandy. At this time as ISS tracked northeastward just inland from the Atlantic coast, the crew was to look towards just right of track and shoot a mapping strip from Brunswick to Savannah), Hurricane Sandy, Atlantic Ocean (DYNAMIC EVENT:  Over the weekend Hurricane Sandy began to recurve northeastward off the east U.S. coast as a minimal Category 1 storm while the wind field expanded.  Yesterday evening and overnight the storm intensified as it began to transition to a winter storm system known locally as a “nor’easter” and threatens the NE coast now with high winds, high tides, and drenching rains. Later, heavy snow is expected in the Appalachians. The National Hurricane Center has held on the hurricane designation for now, but Sandy has made its forecast turn to the NW and is expected to make landfall over southern New Jersey just prior to the ISS pass. At this time the crew was to begin looking primarily left of track for both short and intermediate lens views of this massive storm area, especially for cloud edges or breaks), and Jornada Basin, New Mexico (LTER SITE: This site is devoted to the causes and consequences of desertification.  It is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert just northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico. ISS had an excellent, clear-weather pass over this area in late morning light. At this time, the crew was to shoot just left of track and try for a detailed mapping strip across this area, especially just east of the Rio Grande River).
