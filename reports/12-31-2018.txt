Rodent Research-8 (RR-8): Today a crewmember performed restock of Rodent Habitats 3 and 4. A crewmember also consolidated samples for return. The Rodent Research-8 (RR-8) investigation utilizes mice flown aboard the ISS, and maintained on Earth, to investigate the physiology of aging in response to microgravity and the role of aging in the onset and progression of disease.
Vection: Crewmember performed a video recording in support of the Vection experiment. The objective of The Effect of Long Duration Hypogravity on the Perception of Self-Motion (Vection) study is to determine to what extent an astronaut’s ability to visually interpret motion, orientation, and distance may be disrupted in a microgravity environment, and how it may adapt, and how it may be changed upon return to Earth. Multiple experimental time points inflight and upon return to Earth allows for the adaptation and recovery process to be investigated. 
CASIS PCG 13: Today a crewmember prepared the CASIS PCG 13 solutions by hydrating lyophilized powder and then used a micropipette to fill the PCG-13 sample card wells and then inserted the sample card into cold stowage. The In Situ Space Protein Crystal Growth (CASIS PCG 13) investigation seeks to enhance the way crystals are grown in a microgravity environment by allowing crewmembers to observe imperfections within a crystal and make real-time adjustments to follow-up experiments, rather than returning a sample to Earth and relaunching to try again. This dramatically reduces the time it takes to conduct an experiment aboard the space station and creates a timely, realistic and more cost-effective solution for prospective researchers.
