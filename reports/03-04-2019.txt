The ISS Experience: Today a crewmember replaced the Solid State Drives for the ISS Experience. The ISS Experience creates a virtual reality film documenting daily life aboard the space station. The 8 to 1 10 minute videos created from footage taken during the six-month investigation cover different aspects of crew life, execution of science aboard the station, and the international partnerships involved. The ISS Experience uses a Z-CAM V1 Pro Cinematic Virtual Reality (VR) 360-degree camera with nine 190° fisheye lenses.
Plasma Krystall-4 (PK-4): Today a crewmember installed the PK-4 flex hose to the Argon gas bottle, opened the valve, then reported pressure readings to the ground. This is in preparation for this week’s runs. PK-4 is a scientific collaboration between the ESA and Roscosmos, performing research in the field of “Complex Plasmas”: low temperature gaseous mixtures composed of ionized gas, neutral gas, and micron-sized particles.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) On-Orbit Fit Verification (OFV): Today the crew completed an OFV in support of upcoming P4 Integrated Equipment Assembly (IEA) Channels 4A and 2A Battery ExtraVehicular Activity (EVAs). During the OFV, the crew took body measurements and resized their EMUs to ensure proper fit. Each EMU contains exchangeable components allowing each astronaut to adjust EMU fit to their individual preference. The EVAs are currently planned for March 22 and 29. 
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Yesterday, the Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS and maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to unstow the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) from the Lab Power and Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). At the end of the operations, SSRMS and SPDM were configured to start the SpX-Demo1 Crew Dragon survey later today.
