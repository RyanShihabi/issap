ISS On-Orbit Status 02/04/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty. After wakeup this morning, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), CDR Burbank supported the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 1 once every two hours for seven days.  Burbank performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.] CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov, FE-2 Ivanishin, FE-4 Kononenko, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).         ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. In the Lab, André Kuipers serviced the EarthKAM (EKAM/Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack by changing its battery early in the morning.  Later in the day, André shut down EKAM operations, disconnected the equipment in the WORF rack and stowed it, then relocated its laptop, SSC-11, to its original location in Node-3.       [EK uses a NIKON D2Xs electronic still camera with 50mm and 180mm lenses, powered by a battery, taking pictures by remote operation from the ground, without crew interaction.  It is available for students who submit image requests and conduct geographic research.  The requests are uplinked in a camera control file to the A31p SSC-11 (Station Support Computer) laptop which then activates the camera at specified times and receives the digital images from the camera’s storage card on its hard drive, for subsequent downlink via OpsLAN.  The camera battery is changed when no pictures are being taken.  EKAM uses new software on SSC-11 which replaces the version used for the DCS 760 camera. This was the 4th use of the D2Xs camera by EKAM.] Later, Kuipers conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Don Pettit set up the TM750 camcorder and started, later terminated, the downlink process via the MPC (Multi-Protocol. Converter) of the images gathered from the JAXA Sakura (Cherry Blossom) experiment on 2/2.       [The experiment recorded the floating state of cherry blossom petals in micro-G using the TM750 3D camcorder.  Space Sakura is a JAXA educational payload in which the behavior of Sakura under microgravity is intended to bring new emotion and creativity and to open up a new world of Japanese traditional craft such as Origami.] André performed the periodic leak check on the WRS ARFTA #1 (Water Recovery System Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly 1) by verifying that the “Quantity” ball bearing is still next to the Kapton tape marking from 1/28. At ~5:30am, Anton Shkaplerov had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). At ~7:30am, Don Pettit powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 7:40am conducted a ham radio session with students at Zespol Szkol nr. 8, Walbrzych, Poland. At ~1:40pm, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking messages of greetings to Russia’s Science Day in February, in commemoration of which the Kalinin Central House of Culture in Korolev will be hosting an event to honor science & industrial complex employees who will be getting awards from the Moscow Regional Government, the Deputy Council of the City of Korolev, Moscow Region, and Administration of the City of Korolev, Moscow Region. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.

The ops ended with a nearly perfect landing on the critical vane angle for the bulk shift phenomena which occurs uniquely in the container when the vane perforations are filled with liquid. It required over 10 minutes for the fluid to move!  In addition, you provided us deep entertainment with demonstrations of the dynamic response of the liquid to disturbances imparted by hand during the drain and stowage procedures. We were puzzling and laughing and fully engaged at a level that only occurs with discovery. We are sorry we are so nerdy about this operation in particular and this field in general, but we are experiencing the ISS as a hands-on laboratory like we never imagined. Both Dan and you have drawn us in. You would think we would feel experienced by now, but there are new things happening each time. You also let the camera run during lunch and for 60 minutes we recorded a deep equilibrium configuration near a critical point! Aaah, the simple things in life. This is just great. Also, we would like to dedicate this most enjoyable operation to our trusty Zin-Tech lead engineer Chuck Bunnell who was hospitalized this week for heart concerns. He has been key to the success of our experiments and we love him dearly. More VG ahead. More Chuck Bunnell ahead. Quadrant 2 is done.

FWED (Flywheel Exercise Device, ESA):     No report. GENARA-A (Gravity Regulated Genes in Arabidopsis A/ESA):     No report. GEOFLOW-2 (ESA):      Several science data points have not been acquired due to the FSL Video Management Unit (VMU) anomalies. For the partial science acquisition that could be performed, some runs were performed with the most demanding EC temperature control environment (i.e. cold side of the experimental cell at +20degC, the coldest temperature): again, we received a temperature point skipped by the Experiment Container (EC) PID, and also temperature fluctuations greater than allowed by science requirements. Given the recurrent FSL VMU errors, it has been decided to stand-down for this week, pending engineering assessment of the anomalies.        [Background: Everybody is familiar with liquids. In an average day we get to use, handle or drink water or other liquids.  And everybody knows how fluids (that is liquids and gases) behave: when subjected to a net force, may be pressure, a temperature difference or gravity, they can move freely.  Scientists have been studying how fluids move for centuries, and managed to write mathematical formulas that can describe and predict such movements. Unfortunately, these equations are extremely complex and only approximate solutions are known. As a result, our quantitative understanding of fluid movement is just partial. This is especially true for natural phenomena where the forces can be enormous and unpredictable, like in oceans or in the atmosphere. Or the interior of the earth, where rocks are exposed to pressures and temperatures so incredibly high that they slowly move and adapt their shape. That is, over hundreds of years rocks flow just like a very viscous liquid. Scientists try to study such flows but cannot observe them directly due to the fact that they take place deep beneath the surface of our planet. The only way is to have computers simulating those movements starting from the equations, but how to check whether computers are correct? This is what Geoflow II is trying to answer on board the International Space Station. Geoflow II is a miniature planet that has some of its essential ingredients: a fluid can freely move inside a spherical container that rotates, has temperature differences and has a simulated gravity directed towards the centre just like in a real planet. By taking pictures of the fluid  movements, scientists are able to understand the essential characteristics of the flows and determine whether computer simulations are correct or whether they need to be refined and improved towards a better understanding of the elusive movements that take place inside our planet.] HAIR (JAXA):      No report.

The method is based on the reasonable assumption that the frequency that an issue or category of issues is mentioned in a journal reflects the importance of that issue or category to the writer.  The tone of each entry (positive, negative, or neutral) and phase of the expedition also are variables of interest.  Study results will lead to recommendations for the design of equipment, facilities, procedures, and training to help sustain behavioral adjustment and performance during long-duration space expeditions to the ISS, asteroids, the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

As the brain is a master organ where major crucial processes take place, it is fundamental to understand how it manages adaptation for living in Space.  One of the main purposes of Neurospat (NES) experiment is to focus on how microgravity environment influences cerebral activity of astronauts aboard ISS.  For this, the global electrical activity of the brain of the astronaut is measured thanks to electroencephalogram (EEG) technique, while he or she is executing specific tasks through a computer as if it was a kind of videogame.  In practice, the astronaut is wearing a specially equipped cap with passive, gel filled electrodes that are in contact with his/her scalp while he or she is performing the specific tasks that we have designed.  These are visual-orientation perception and visuo-motor tracking tasks that may be encountered on a daily basis.  The tasks allow the study of 5 cognitive processes: Perception, Attention, Memorization, Decision and Action.  Besides there are also task-irrelevant images that are showed to the astronaut in order to assess how well he or she processes novel visual stimuli.  The electrodes all over the scalp are linked to sensitive amplifiers that allow us to measure small variations of electrical potential between different regions of the scalp.  These signals are in turn used to estimate activity in the cerebral cortex related to the task being performed.  Also, they serve to identify the mental processes associated with these tasks and to localize in the brain the sources of the underlying neural activity.  After analysis of the data we can better understand whether the novel environment of microgravity accompanied by a multitude of stressors may place an increased load on the cognitive capacity of the human brain and whether the sensory signals and motor responses of astronauts are processed and interpreted differently because a new reference frame.] NOA-1/-2 (Nitric Oxide Analyzer, ESA):    Complete.

[Background:  The ROALD-2 experiment studies how the function of T-cells from the immune system are affected by microgravity and spaceflight.  T-cells play an important role in controlling the immune systems response to infection.  It has previously been shown that the immune response of astronauts can be reduced following spaceflight and it has also been shown that the activation of T-cells in culture is reduced in microgravity.  A series of experiments on T-cells and other immune system cells have been previously performed by different scientific teams on Space Shuttle and the ISS over the last 30 years.  The data from these individual experiments provides information which together can be used to understand the mechanisms by which gravity or the absence of gravity can affect T-cell function.] Robonaut (NASA):    No report.

[Background:  Fluids and gases are never at rest. This statement is in apparent contradiction with our experience: when we pour water in a glass and wait until all flows have disappeared and the temperature of the liquid is in equilibrium with that of the room, we see that water appears to be completely at rest. However, if we were able to see the individual molecules of water with a very powerful microscope, we would discover that they are incessantly moving and collide with each other following frantic, random paths even if the liquid appears to be quiescent at naked eye. Scientists are interested in observing and measuring such movements because they reveal important, practical information: how fast does heat propagates in a fluid? How fast do liquid mixtures mix? Such phenomena occur in absence of a macroscopic flow, that is when the fluid appears to be at rest, and are called heat and mass diffusion respectively. While the theoretical prediction of heat and mass diffusion is still quite challenging, its measurement is a standard laboratory practice, but may become extremely difficult or impossible when dealing with mixtures of many liquids, due to the fact that such measurement needs to be carried out when the fluid is quiescent, a condition sometimes impossible to achieve on ground. This is precisely the objective of the SODI DSC experiment carried out on board the International Space Station: the measurement of diffusion in mixtures of liquids. By using very sensitive optical techniques, it will be possible to measure mass diffusion, compare with current theories, and improve our present understanding of how molecules move in liquid mixtures. The results will be used by the large team of scientists involved in the project to try to understand which of the many existing theories for mass diffusion is correctly predicting the experimental behavior.] SOLAR (Solar Monitoring Observatory, ESA):        Sun Visibility Window#49 started on 1/22 and ended on 2/2.  Regular Sun measurements performed with SOLSPEC. For SolACES, the instrument was put in heating configuration for the 45P undocking, unforeseen DAM maneuver and 46P docking events, respectively on 1/23-28-29. On 2/1, SOLSPEC encountered a communication error, but the planned science program could be recovered. The next Sun Visibility Window#50 is predicted to start on 2/14. SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity):    “Dear Dan and André, a big thank you for your dedication to perform your first 5-day session this week, especially with some difficult PCBA measurements. We will retrieve ASAP your electronic logs on 2/3 and ask for a quick assessment by the science team (esp. for the PCBA measurements). Thanks a lot for the efforts sticking to the diet, much appreciated!” Space-DRUMS (Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix System):    No report. Space Food (JAXA):    No report.

[Background:  It is known that the ability of blood vessels to vasoconstrict - the ability of the muscular vessel wall to narrow the diameter of the blood vessel - is impaired during and after a human has been in space.  "Vessel Imaging" is using the Ultrasound scanner on board the ISS to take images of the five different blood vessels in the lower abdomen and in the legs to study what changes occur to cause the blood vessels to be less able to vasoconstrict. For each vessel, a 5 second scan is performed to observe the blood vessel during several heart beats, followed by a scan where the ultrasound scan-head is tilted to allow a "cut through the blood vessel wall".  The same scans are also performed before flight, and these pre-flight images are used as the baseline to which the in-flight data is compared with. The images are analyzed to detect any changes in the blood vessel wall properties, such as wall thickness, elasticity or structure, changes in the size of the blood vessel or blood flow (volume) while the crewmember is in orbit.] VIABLE  (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS Payload Touch, NASA):    No report.
