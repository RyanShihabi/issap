ISS On-Orbit Status 11/17/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  ·        Sleep Cycle Shift:    Sleep cycle has returned to nominal for the (currently) six-member crew: Wakeup – 1:00am, sleep – 4:30pm EST.  First thing in Post-Sleep prior to eating, drinking & brushing teeth, FE-3 Burbank performed his first liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 1).  The collections are made every other day for six days.       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples & analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.] Also at wake-up, Dan Burbank completed his first post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] CDR Fossum checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera & flashlight battery charge.  The Nikon D2Xs camera with EarthKAM software running with the Intervalometer on SSC-18 (Station Support Computer 18) is taking automated flash photography of Sample 3.  Today, Mike took photographs of the equipment setup for ground situational awareness.       [After starting on 11/10, the camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking one photo every 2 hrs (changed today from 1 hr).  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6 Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.] Most of the work day was spent on Crew Handover activities between the 27S & 28S crewmembers, to familiarize the new Expedition 29/30 residents with onboard equipment and procedures. In Node-3/Cupola, FE-5 Furukawa disconnected the RWS DCP (Robotic Work Station / Display & Control Panel) bypass cable, removing power from the RWS after it served yesterday for the Ku-band video “scheme” downlink of imagery of the Soyuz approach & docking to the MRM2 “Poisk” module. Afterwards, Satoshi worked in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), removing the blackout curtain of the SSHDTV (Super Sensitive High-Definition Television) camera and stowing it in a Ziploc bag. FE-1 Shkaplerov, FE-2 Ivanishin & FE-4 Volkov set up and serviced the 28S-delivered Russian bioengineering experiments.     [In particular, Anton, Anatoly & Sergey –·        Started the BTKh-35 MEMBRANE payload (Kit #1), with FE-2 taking documentary photography,·        Set up and activated BIO-8 PLAZMIDA, photographed by FE-4,·        Activated BTKh-14 BIOEMULSIYA and set it up in the TBU thermostat-controlled container at +37 degC, and·        Removed the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment from the KRIOGEM-03 cooler, set it up in the GB/Glavboks-S (Glovebox-S), charged the bioreactor, inserted it into the KT thermal enclosure for sample mixing and later transferred it to the TBU-V at +29 degC, then deactivated the KT and removed BTKh-26 from the GB.] Sergey Volkov also had ~2 hrs set aside for terminating & closing out the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, collecting the grown samples in their KM A32 & A24 root modules and pre-packing the cut plants for return on Soyuz 27S.  The equipment was then closed down.      [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] In preparation for the Exp-29 crew departure, the six crewmembers joined up for a 1h 40m Crew Emergency Roles & Responsibilities Review (peredacha smeniy po bezopasnosti), to familiarize themselves with emergency roles & responsibilities as a 6-person crew, including escape routes, and afterwards for the three newcomers to refresh their emergency roles & responsibilities as a 3-person crew.  Later, the crew had a ~20min tagup with ground specialists to discuss particulars.        [Baseline emergency response actions are covered in the EMER-1 book.  Emergencies may arise due to ammonia (NH3) leak, non-ammonia toxic spills, fire or rapid depressurization.  In the event that a member of the 27S crew becomes incapacitated during such an emergency response, the whole crew will stop response procedures and return to their Soyuz spacecraft.  The 28S crew may, after conferring with the ISS CDR, egress their Soyuz and finish the response in this case.] Volkov performed his 4th preliminary (predvariteljnaya) ODNT orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test run with the Russian Chibis suit in preparation for his return to gravity on 11/21 (along with Mike Fossum & Satoshi Furukawa).  Sergey conducted the exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure ODNT device (US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill, assisted by Satoshi as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) and supported by ground tagup via VHF at 9:50am EST.        [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  The preparatory training consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -30, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG SHKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap, supported by the Gamma-1M biomed data control system.   The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] CDR Fossum performed the periodic leak check on the WRS (Water Recovery System) Rack 2 Recycle Tank, verifying that the bellows position has not moved, then restowed the tank. Afterwards, Mike conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. With the 2nd Router for the JSL (Joint Station LAN) Dual OCA (Orbital Communication Adapter) configuration (set up by Furukawa on 11/8 for the possibility of a decrewing) no longer required, Satoshi took it down, reloaded the JSL laptop to its default configuration and stowed the Router with the other hardware for backup purposes. Sergey completed the daily routine servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] The three new station residents, Anton, Anatoly & Dan, underwent the obligatory CMS (Countermeasures Systems) overview which is required of each new crewmember prior to the first physical exercised session.  Later, they focused on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser as the first device, observing Mike & Satoshi as they worked out on the device.        [The newcomers familiarized himself with location and usage of items such as the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) components (chest strap, transmitter, watch), TVIS & CEVIS PCMCIA memory cards, treadmill harness, ergometer & athletic shoes, and the SBS (Series Bungee System) assembly.  Mike’s & Satoshi’s shoes were reported “MIA”, i.e., could not be located as yet.] FE-1 Shkaplerov worked in the Orbital Module (BO) of the newly arrived Soyuz TMA-22/28S (#232), installing and connecting the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its TA765B/PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit from SM stowage, recycled from an earlier vehicle. Anton also removed the two Klest-152 TV cameras and light units from the Soyuz spacecraft, stowing the cameras in the Soyuz 27S (#702) Descent Module for return and trashing the removed SG2-14V light units in the 27S Orbital Module for disposal. In the US Lab (loc. S3), the CDR worked on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to configure it for another ground-controlled experiment/research run.  With the Lab camcorder adjusted to view CIR live from the Node-1 side and after verifying the main & auxiliary RPCs (Remote Power Controllers) to be open plus touch temperatures within limits, Mike removed & replaced a manifold bottle on one of four manifolds (B) in front of the Optics Bench.        [Steps included opening the upper doors, removing CIR manifold bottle B #2018 containing 40% O2 (oxygen), 20% He, 40% N2 (nitrogen) plus 308 psia pressure remaining, replacing it with manifold bottle B #2024 containing 40% O2 (oxygen), 60% N2 (nitrogen), then placing the manual vent valve in VENT position, GIP valve lever in Up (open) position, closing the upper rack doors again, turning on two switches, and notifying POIC of rack readiness.] Sergey Volkov completed his 6th (and final) data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.        [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group & work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] Working with FE-3 Burbank as part of Crew Handovers, Fossum serviced the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) workout machine, performing periodic maintenance by evacuating its cylinder flywheels to reestablish proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration. Soyuz 28S crewmembers Shkaplerov, Ivanishin & Burbank had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. Preparatory to today’s ISS reboost at 11:07pm, Mike closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and Kibo JPM. Before Presleep, the CDR, with FE-3 assisting per Handover, will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Mike & Dan will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~3:55am EST, the three Russian Flight Engineers, supported a Russian PAO TV event in front of the pictures of K. E. Tsiolkovsky, S. P. Korolev, Y. A. Gagarin and M. V. Lomonossov, downlinking greetings to the participants of a Celebratory Meeting dedicated to the 300th Anniversary of the great Russian scientist M. V. Lomonossov, scheduled on 11/19 at the M. V. Lomonossov Moscow State University. At ~12:55pm, Fossum & Burbank joined for a PAO TV downlink, responding to interview questions from KHOU-TV, Houston, TX (Kevin Reece). FE-1, FE-2, FE-3 & FE-4 had their standard weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- & Ku-band audio/video, the first ones for the newcomers, Daniel at ~7:55am, Sergey at ~11:10am, Anton at ~11:55am, Anatoly at ~12:20pm EST.The 27S crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5). CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Tirane, Albania (the Albanian capital and largest city of nearly 700,000 lies is located in a hill-surrounded valley that drains NW towards the Adriatic Sea.  ISS had a midday pass with a rare clear day expected for this area.  As it tracked southeastward over the Adriatic from Italy, the crew was to look left of track and inland for this target), El Hierro Eruptions, Canary Islands (DYANMIC EVENT:  El Hierro is located the furthest south and west of the Canary Islands.  Vigorous submarine volcanic activity has been occurring off the south coast of the island for months and recently has produced an extensive display of steam and a submarine plume of volcanic material there.  On this early afternoon pass, as ISS approached from the NW in partly cloudy conditions, the crew was to try for long lens views of this display by looking obliquely right of track towards the south coast of El Hierro), Central Cuba (ongoing research at Florida International University is seeking imagery to document and analyze land cover change in central Cuba.  Today ISS had a fair-weather pass in mid-afternoon light over this target area.  As it approached the south coast of Cuba from the NW, the crew was to look just right of track and attempt a mapping strip of overlapping imagery just inland along the coast from the Zapata Peninsula to the Gulf of Ana Maria), Sierra de los Ajos (ISS had an early afternoon, nadir pass in clear weather over this target area with its approach from the NW.  This club-shaped, roughly north-south range of mountains is situated in the northeastern part of the state of Sonora Mexico between the mining center of Cananea and the General Lazaro Cardenas Reservoir.  With elevations ranging from about 4,000 to 8,600 feet, the Sierra de los Ajos support an ecologically diverse, alpine-woodland habitat within the Sonoran Desert that includes them in the regional province of scattered highlands known as the Madrean Sky Islands of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States.  CEO is seeking detailed mapping views of this target for baseline and change detection of this unique and threatened habitat), and Popocatepetl Volcano, Mexico (ISS had a mid-afternoon, nadir pass in fair weather over Mexico's second highest peak at 17,802 feet.  “Popo” is a large, active volcano located 43 miles southeast of Mexico City.  Mapping frames of the volcano and flanks were requested to capture current summit glacier extent and cone geomorphology). ISS Reboost:  A one-burn reboost of the ISS will be performed tonight at 11:07pm EST using the two KD engines of the SM’s ODU (Integrated Propulsion System) for a burn duration of 3m 37s and a planned Delta-V of 3.42 m/s, increasing mean altitude by 5.95 km.  The purpose of the reboost is to set up phasing for 27S landing.
