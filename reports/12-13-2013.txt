External Thermal Control System (ETCS) Loop A Status:  Overnight ground specialist power cycled the ETCS Loop A Pump Control Valve Package (PCVP), which includes the Flow Control Valve (FCV), in an attempt to correct the FCV position error.  The ETCS has been repowered, however the FCV position error has not been corrected.  ETCS Loop A is still operating without full temperature control.  The Loop A Interface Heat Exchangers (IFHX) are still bypassed and isolated, preventing internal heat rejection on loop A.  ETCS Loop B continues to operate nominally.  Due to the loss of heat rejection for the Node 2 Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL), half of the power loads in the Node 2, JEM and Columbus modules remain powered off.
Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) Loop Flush:  Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Wakata, with assistance from FE-5 -Mastracchio, performed a loop flush of the two ABRS internal rear cooling loops to remove any air bubbles.  The flush for Chamber 1 was successful but not for Chamber 2.  Chamber 1, which will be used for Advanced Plant Experiments-02 (APEX-02) arriving on the SpaceX-3 vehicle, has been activated and will be monitored for the next four days.
Body Measures:  FE-6 Hopkins, with operator assistance from FE-5 Mastracchio, configured cameras and cabin video, perform body marker instrumentation, and collect calibration and body pose photos and circumference measurements. This is Hopkins’ Flight Day 80 (FD80) session, which is the second of three sessions planned for him.  The goal of this study is to gather preliminary data to better understand the magnitude and variability of anticipated  changes to body measurements caused by microgravity and fluid shift. This data is important to be able to determine the changes that may occur during long-duration space flight and to be able to apply the changes to suit fit, suit sizing, workstation design, etc. for future missions to maximize performance, prevent injury, and reduce crew time for altering or adjusting their suits, workstation, etc. to accommodate their anthropometrics.
Reversible Figures Experiment: FE-3 Hopkins performed his fourth session, and FE-6 Wakata his second session, of  Reversible Figures in free floating conditions. Each crewmember participating in Reversable Figures performs this activity a minimum of four times during their stay on board.  ESA’s Reversible Figures experiment investigates whether the perception of ambiguous perspective-reversible figures that can normally be seen to change in perspective or orientation is affected by microgravity.  A comparison is made of the perceived reversals during visualization of the figures in crewmembers that occurs before, during and after long-term exposure to microgravity.   It is expected that measurable, perceptual differences will provide insight into human cognitive-perception dynamics in the microgravity environment of the ISS and in normal gravity on Earth.
Cygnus Offset Grapple #2 On-Board Training (OBT):  Today the Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) and performed the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Latching End Effector (LEE) Checkout and the SSRMS LEE, Brake and Joint Diagnostics on the Prime String.  They then powered up the MSS in hot backup configuration and performed the SSRMS Brake and Joint Diagnostics on the Redundant String.   The Crew (Hopkins, Wakata, Mastracchio) maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) into and out of the grapple envelope of the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) Flight Releasable Grapple Fixture (FRGF).  They repeated this three times and then started a final maneuver of SSRMS Latching End Effector (LEE)-A into the grapple envelope of the PMM FRGF during which the Robotics Ground Controllers safed the SSRMS.  This was the second of two SSRMS practice sessions to help prepare the ISS Crew for capturing the Orbital-1.  After the completion of the grapple practice, the Robotics Ground Controllers maneuvered the SSRMS to the Node 2 Nadir Active Common Berthing Mechanism (ABCM) Survey position and performed the SSRMS LEE Checkout and Diagnostics on the Redundant String.  MSS performance was nominal.
