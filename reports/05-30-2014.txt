Resist Tubule Lamp Replacement:  Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Gerst replaced the failed Xenon lamp today that is used for JAXA’s Resist Tubule experiment.
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU) Transfer Interface (I/F): Following the conclusion of Camera Light Pan Tilt Assembly (CLPA) activities this week, ISS Commander Swanson removed the JEM ORU Transfer I/F from the JEM Airlock slide table, returning it to the nominal configuration. 
Velocicalc Airflow Measurement Survey: In support of monitoring the health of the ISS InterModule Ventilation (IMV) system, today FE-5 Wiseman used the Velocicalc device and measurement aids to measure the air flow  in outlets and inlets throughout the USOS modules. In addition to flow rate measurements, inspections were performed in selected locations.
39 Soyuz (39S) Crew Handover: Swanson conducted a crew handover with the 39S crew today. Topics included recommendations for suggested on-orbit practices and lessons learned related to ISS systems and payloads. The crew also reviewed recent deltas to the ISS configuration.
Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustible Products (CSA-CP) Extended Routine Maintenance: Swanson changed out batteries in all units and units were zero calibrated. He also verified there was no evidence of liquid or discoloration indicating a sensor leak.
Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) Status: Following an ARED dashpot inspection Tuesday it was discovered that 2 of the 4 x-axis dashpots were broken and the other 2 were degraded. The crew was instructed to stand down on ARED use until the dashpots could be replaced.  Swanson began the replacement Wednesday and completed it yesterday.  After a successful checkout, ARED was declared GO for use.
