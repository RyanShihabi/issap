ISS On-Orbit Status 10/17/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Underway:  Week 5 of Increment 29 (three-person crew). FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. First thing in Post-sleep, FE-5 Furukawa & CDR Fossum undertook their 18th weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.        [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.]  Volkov performed the periodic (every Monday) verification of the automatic IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2, as well as the manual update on the non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the recent (8/8) installation of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Sergey also conducted the regular monthly/quarterly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation & Stabilization).          [Required was an inspection of the condition of harnesses, belt slats, corner bracket ropes, SLD (Subject Load Device) cables & exit pulley housing, IRBAs (Isolation Restorative Bungee Assemblies) and gyroscope wire ropes for any damage or defects, lubricating as required plus recording control panel time & date values, and making sure that the display cable and skirt were properly secured afterwards.] Later, FE-4 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At the EDR (European Drawer Rack) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Satoshi made all power & data connections between the ERB2 (Erasmus Recording Binocular 2) and EDR, mounted ERB2 on EDR and then changed the “out2” switch at the EDR ESEM4-E2 (Exchangeable Standard Electronic Module 4-E2) from the Off position to On. In the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Satoshi afterwards serviced the FPEF MS (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility / Marangoni Surface) payload by removing & replacing 5 HDs (hard disks) of the IPU VRU (Image Processing Unit / Video Recording Unit),- #1096, #1097, #1098, #1099, #1020.         [The replaced VRU disks (#1091, #1092, #1093, #1094, #1095) were put in a Ziploc bag for return to SSIPC (Space Station Integration & Promotion Center/Tsukuba)]. With video camcorder set up for monitoring the front of the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), CDR Fossum disassembled & removed the CCF (Capillary Channel Flow) hardware from the MSG and stowed it, then powered MSG down. After powering down PCS (Portable Computer System) laptops in the Lab & Node-2 as well as equipment attached to UOPs (Utility Outlet Panels)-2 & -7 in Lab & UOP-1 in Node-2, Fossum gathered the necessary gear and began Part 1 of the lengthy IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of removing & replacing the failed RPCM (Remote Power Controller Module) A4A in the Lab (to be continued tomorrow).  The deactivated equipment attached to UOPs 2, 7 & 1 were then powered up again, later also the PCS laptops.       [A few weeks ago RPCM A4A_C in the Lab had an RPC (Remote Power Controller) failure.   The RPC provides redundant power to ER2 (EXPRESS Rack 2) which powers the Ku-Band Receiver.  RPCM A4A_C is one of several RPCMs on a power bus located at the back of the DDCU-1 (DC/DC Converter Unit) Rack 1 at Lab P3.  Accessing the RPCM required removing the CEVIS exercise machine and rotating LAB1P3 for the duration of the activity.]  Satoshi Furukawa began his 3rd Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment, assisted by Mike Fossum as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres. At ~10:55am, FE-5 Furukawa observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business.         [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Satoshi started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.] After reviewing applicable payload procedures and training material, Satoshi visually inspected and activated the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), adjusted the G1 video camera to transmit his activities on Ku-band to the console team on the ground and then set up the SODI-COLLOID (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument – Colloid) hardware in the MSG WV (Work Volume).       [Colloid is part of the ESA triple experiment series of SODI (IVIDIL, DSC, Colloid) for advanced research in vibration effects on diffusion in liquids, diffusion measurements in petroleum reservoirs and the study on growth and properties of advanced photonic materials within colloidal solutions, respectively.] Other tasks completed by FE-5 Furukawa included –The periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose;  [after the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged],Another session with the psychological POMS (Profile of Mood States) experiment, completing his questionnaire for downlink to ground specialist,Setting up the equipment for the CSA (Canadian Space Agency) VASC/Vascular Blood Collection protocol scheduled tomorrow for him and Mike, their 2nd sampling;   [after the blood draw, samples will be spun in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) prior to stowing them in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), after recording the blood tube bar codes.  Led by the Canadian University of Waterloo’s Dr. Richard Hughson, VASCULAR is studying the long-term effects of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system.  Previous medical tests have shown that astronauts who live and work in space for long periods of time experience changes in their blood vessels that are like the aging on Earth.  But in space these changes happen in months instead of years and decades.  The blood vessels become stiffer and lose their elasticity. This can change blood pressure and affect blood flow to vital organs such as the brain and kidney.  Six international astronauts are taking part in VASCULAR, each staying about 6 months on the station.  Their blood samples are being returned to Dr. Hughson’s laboratory for measurements of unique protein and hormone markers that could accelerate vascular aging.  The results of VASCULAR will offer a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of cardiovascular changes during long-duration space missions.  The findings can also help people who suffer from premature cardiovascular aging right now back home on Earth],Initiating maintenance discharge on EVA batteries in the U.S. Airlock BSA (Battery Storage Assembly), and·         Starting another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later;  [consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware]. Meanwhile, Vostok reset the RSK2 laptop, a T61p model with USB Converter/Adapter and turned off the test run of the Russian KPT-14 SHADOW-BEACON (Tenj-Mayak) experiment, connected to the Kenwood D700 ”Sputnik” amateur/ham radio.       [Objective of KPT-14 is the automatic retranslation of time tag (pre-planned executable) packets from ground stations.  SHADOW (or ECLIPSE), sponsored by Roskosmos and its leading Moscow research organization TSNIIMASH (Central Research Institute of Machine Building), employs VHF amateur radio (ham) operators around the globe (via ARISS/Amateur Radio on ISS) to help in observing refraction/scattering effects in artificial plasmas using the method of RF (radio frequency) sounding in space experiments under different geophysical conditions.] After charging its battery, FE-4 then installed & started the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 for another run, using it to observe the Earth ionosphere & surface at specific uplinked times.  Later, FE-4 dismantled the equipment again and dumped the data via the RSS1 terminal.      [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] Sergey Volkov checked out proper MKSD Control & Data Acquisition Module communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, then copied science & service data, accumulated from the GFI-17 Molniya-GAMMA (“Lightning-GAMMA”) experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28, over to external media (16 GB flash card).  Later (~10:30am EDT), he initiated their downlink from the RSK1 laptop to the ground via OCA.       [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.] Sergey also had another hour set aside for stowing discarded items & waste on the cargo ship-turned-trash can Progress 42P.  Afterwards, FE-4 conducted the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness). In the US Lab, Fossum worked on the CIR FCF (Combustion Integrated Rack / Fluids & Combustion Facility) to vacuum-clean & prepare the MWA WSA (Maintenance Work Area Work Surface Area) for upcoming FCF payload use.       [Activities included setting up the containment system and performing post-launch inspection of the CIR HiBMS (High Bit Depth/Multispectral) imaging package (which contains material that had the potential of shattering), CIR LCTFM (Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter Module), CIR LLL-IR (Low Light Level Infrared) Filter Module, and LMM (Light Microscopy Module) Monochrome Camera 1 for shatterable materials.  The MWA containment system was then restowed.] Mike also serviced the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) workout machine, performing periodic maintenance by evacuating its cylinder flywheels to reestablish proper vacuum condition & sensor calibration. Before “Presleep” period tonight, the CDR turns on the MPC and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Mike will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5). Tasks listed for Sergei Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), Taking care of the daily IMS (Integrated Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur),Another ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andCompleting the daily inspection of the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules;   [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
