ISS On-Orbit Status 07/01/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     As part of the crew’s regular morning inspection tour, CDR Borisenko performed the routine checkup of circuit breakers & fuses in the DC1 (Docking Compartment).      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 & MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 & BPP-36.  MRM2 & MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.] With its battery recharged overnight, FE-1 Samokutyayev set up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM window #9 for another sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with the coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloaded the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.  The equipment was then torn down and stowed away.      [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere], In the Lab, FE-3 Ron Garan had several hours of work, removing & replacing the failed Lab MCA (Major Constituent Analyzer) Mass Spectrometer (ORU 2), to be returned on ULF7.  The R&R was not fully completed due to a time-consuming issue with fasteners.     [For the R&R, Ron first had to remove the Lab MCA Drawer for which the D6 rack had to be rotated down (away from the wall).  To gain access to the MSA (Mass Spectrometer Assembly), the VGA (Verification Gas Assembly) also had to be taken out temporarily. The failed spectrometer has been removed and prepacked for return.  Activities will be replanned to complete this R&R and activate the MCA.] Meanwhile, Andrey Borisenko & Sergei Volkov spent several hours in the SM (Service Module) on the long-awaited major TVIS treadmill IFM (Inflight Maintenance).  The gyroscope removal went well, and no crew calldowns were required.      [After taking the TVIS out of the “pit” in the SM floor, Andrey & Sergei removed the failed treadmill gyroscope, to be returned on Atlantis.  While TVIS was out of the pit, they lubricated the transfer case, vacuumed the screens, checked the Aft Right Stabilizer Witness Mark and inspected one corner.  TVIS was then temporarily stowed to await the new gyro, to be delivered on ULF7.  The activities were monitored by MCC-Houston TVIS specialists.] FE-5 Furukawa performed the periodic reboot of the JAXA Kibo SLT (System Laptop Terminal) computer (which had experienced a recurrence of communications failure on 6/10). Afterwards, Satoshi initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer) after executing some troubleshooting steps (swapping a T61p laptop cable to see if the cable was causing AQM runs to be unsuccessful), and deactivated the system ~5 hrs later.       [This was the 2nd session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1001, after the previous instrument (#1004) was used for 37 runs after it had replaced the earlier instrument, #1002, which was used for approximately 7 sessions.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware. In the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-6 Fossum worked on the MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3), removing its failed EU (Electronic Unit) and inserting a new spare instead.  The failed unit was packed for return. Borisenko performed a hardware test on the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, checking the operation of the greenhouse in Cultivation mode (no water feed to the root modules & no seed planting), using the RSK2 T61p laptop instead of the RSE-Med laptop.     [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]  Afterwards, Andrey started a new round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today replacing the SKPF1 & SKPF2 dust filters and cleaned the GZhT gas-liquid heat exchanger grill in the MRM1 Rassvet module after taking documentary photography, then updating the IMS (Inventory Management System) database. Volkov worked preventive maintenance in the FGB, cleaning the detachable VT7 fan screens of the three SOTR gas-liquid heat exchangers (GZhT4), plus the fixed GZhT4 grill with vacuum cleaner and soft brush. FE-3 Garan completed the periodic maintenance of the CSI (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5 / Science Insert), deactivating & decabling CGBA-5, accessing CSI-05, performing spider feeding activity, then closing up CGBA, recabling and reactivating it.  The spider girls have been spinning perfectly circular webs – which they are not known to do on Earth.        [During the operation, POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) temporarily disabled the AAA (Avionics Air Assembly) fan to check whether it’s causing a squeal reported earlier by Ron.  SHAB (Spider Hab) video is monitoring for 24 hours after feeding activity unit.  The spider is called the Nephila clavipes.  It is also known as the “Banana Spider” because of its yellow banana shaped body.  It is sometimes referred to as the “Golden Silk” or “Golden Orb” spider because its web has a golden hue when viewed in the sunlight.  It is commonly found in the southern parts of the US, particularly Florida, but it can be found throughout all parts of the southern United States including Alabama and Texas.  The two spiders in the habitats (Gladys & Esmerelda) are juvenile females and are only about ½ in. long.  When female Nephila clavipes complete their last molt and become mature adults, they can be over 3 in. long and their webs over 3 ft across.  (Unfortunately, these space spiders will most likely not live until adulthood nor will they get quite that large).  To keep the spiders as healthy as possible for as long as possible, they are given a diet of wild type fruit flies.  The fruit flies are provided a diet enriched with extra protein.  The protein is ground-up dog food that is added to their normal diet of potato flakes.  The spider scientists are interested in the Nephila clavipes because she builds a three-dimensional web on the ground that appears disorganized but is in fact very ordered.  The hypothesis is these spiders will not build as much 3 dimension into their web given the absence of gravity.  This may help scientists more clearly understand the purpose of the 3D web on Earth.]  In further preparation for their EVA during ULF7, Garan & Fossum performed the routine SOP (Secondary Oxygen Pack) checkout & leak check on EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units) 3009 & 3010, using battery power. Ron & Mike also worked in the A/L (Airlock) on configuring & readying equipment & tools for their spacewalk. Sasha Samokutyayev had another ~1.5 hrs for transferring cargo items from Progress 43P to the ISS for stowage, logging moves and locations in the IMS (Inventory Management System) database. After this morning’s reboost by Progress 43P, the CDR performed the periodic task of downloading structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.     [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] Andrey also conducted the periodic (~monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control & Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO2 filter assembly (BF) with a new unit, delivered on Progress 42P (done last: 4/9).  The old unit was discarded and the IMS updated.     [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO2, O2, and H2O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.] Furukawa had another 1h 40m reserved on his timeline for continuing prepacking ULF7 return cargo, followed at ~12:35pm by ground specialist tagup for debriefing. Afterwards, Ron, Mike & Satoshi got together for an hour for a joint review of ULF7 cargo transfer plans, studying an MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) overview, transfer activities and general transfer “choreography”.  At ~1:45pm, they then tagged up with ground specialists in a teleconference to discuss specifics. FE-4 Volkov, FE-5 Furukawa & FE-6 Fossum undertook another ~30 min Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) photography training session, to practice in-cabin shooting using an Orbiter tile diagram cutout and the NIKON D2Xs still camera with 400 mm lens.  During the training run, Sergei used the 800 mm lens, Satoshi the 400 mm lens and Mike the other 800 mm lens.       [The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of STS-135/Atlantis/ULF7, to arrive on 7/10.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Atlantis, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.] Ron performed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.       [The current card (28-0014C) lists 101 good CWCs (2,282.2 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (21 CWCs with 846.4 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 562.2 L in 14 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (68 CWCs with 1,241.3 L (also 36 expired or leaking bags with 658.8 L);  4. condensate water (158.2 L in 7 bags, plus 3 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (36.3 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Sasha took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-5 located and serviced the JAXA FUJI 3D camera, removing its battery and 3 used batteries from the camera bag for stowage, then reported the number of good batteries. Satoshi also filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).  It was his 2nd time.     [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] At ~3:55am EDT, the six crewmembers held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow. At ~7:30am, Sasha linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory & stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers. At ~9:15am, Sasha turned on the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) for a ham radio session with the 300-450 graduates of St. Petersburg State Engineering and Economics University Branch in Tver (INZhECON-TVER), who are currently receiving diplomas of economics managers in healthcare, transportation systems, municipal services, and tourism. At ~10:00am, FE-3 Garan conducted the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists, discussing pre-ULF7 stowage questions. At ~10:45am, Ron Garan used the SM’s amateur radio equipment for a ham radio session with students at the Youth Hostel "La Foresta" at Rome, Italy. At ~3:30pm, the three crewmembers had their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston. At ~9:15am, Sasha turned on the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) for a ham radio session with the 300-450 graduates of St. Petersburg State Engineering and Economics University Branch in Tver (INZhECON-TVER), who are currently receiving diplomas of economics managers in healthcare, transportation systems, municipal services, and tourism. At ~10:45am, Ron Garan used the SM’s amateur radio equipment for a ham radio session with students at the Youth Hostel "La Foresta" at Rome, Italy. Before “Presleep” period tonight, Garan powers on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR,FE-4).  No exercise reported for FE-6. Reboost Update:  The 2nd one-burn ISS reboost (of 2) was performed this morning at 8:16am EDT using Progress 43P DPO rendezvous & docking thrusters, with attitude control handover to RS MCS (Motion Control System) at 6:30am and return to US CMGs at 9:10am.  Due to the thruster malfunction during 43P docking, only 4 thrusters were used (instead of the usual 8).  Burn duration: 29m 32s.   Actual Delta-V was 1.97 m/s (6.46 ft/s) vs. predicted 1.95/6.60.  New mean altitude: 388.3 km (209.7 nmi) – ready for ULF7.  Apogee height: 390.2 km (210.7 nmi); perigee height: 386.4 km (208.6 nmi).  Prop consumption for the reboost totaled 296.3 kg for the burn, and 4.5 kg for attitude control.  Progress 43P supplied the reboost and pitch/yaw propellant from its resupply tanks  Purpose of the reboosts was to gain altitude and set up phasing conditions for ULF7. Robotics Update:   The crew maneuvered the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) to release MBS PDGF-3 (Mobile Base System Power & Data Grapple Fixture 3) and grapple the Node-2 PDGF instead.  After the base change (control transfer) to the Node-2 PDGF, the MBS was released and the SSRMS maneuvered to the ULF7 Start position.  The now unoccupied MT (Mobile Transporter) was moved from WS5 (Workstation 5) to WS4.  This completes all MSS (Mobile Service Systems) preparations for ULF7. PMA-2 Decision:  With no more Shuttles after STS-135 arriving at ISS, the decision was made to leave the Pressurized Mating Adapter 2 pressurized after ULF7 departure so that it can be used like a closet,- like PMA3.  Since it is not designed for stowage, it would require non-standard stowage.  Before anything will be stowed, the thermal environment has to be determined.  CEO targets uplinked for today were Kwanza Basin (general views were requested to document a thin string of new developments [infrastructure such as main roads, power lines, and settlements along the roads] between the capital city, Luanda, and new oilfields inland.  Critical features were to be acquired with overlapping images.  The rationale behind imaging this site is to document planned and unplanned changes in the Luanda-oilfields corridor developing between the coastal capital city, Luanda, and the new oilfields to the northeast.  Few usable images have yet been acquired, mainly due to the presence of continuous equatorial cloud), Tehran, Iran (the Iranian capital with a population nearing 9 million is located in the northern part of the country about 70 miles south of the coast of the Caspian Sea.  ISS had a nadir pass in clear weather at midday.  As it tracked over the desert towards the Alborz Range, the crew was to look nadir for this sprawling urban area), and Wells Creek Impact Crater, TN (Wells Creek is an exposed impact crater in Tennessee.  This target was close to nadir.  Overlapping mapping images were requested. The crater is 12 km in diameter and is estimated to be about 200 million years old).
