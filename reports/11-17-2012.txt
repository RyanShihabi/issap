ISS On-Orbit Status 11/17/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – Crew half-day off. Preps for Soyuz 31S Undocking After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   FE-1 Novitskiy completed the daily reboot of the Russian RS1 & RS2 laptops, and FE-2 Tarelkin rebooted the RSS1 & RSS2 laptops. After wake-up, FE-3 Ford swapped out the battery of the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) equipment at the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack, then re-activated the NIKON D2Xs (50mm lens) plus software. Later in the day (~6:45am EST), Kevin terminated the EarthKAM session, shutting down the equipment, stowing the gear (except for the power string) and returning the SSC13 (Station Support Computer 13) to its nominal operations position.    [This was the 5th use of the NIKON D2Xs camera by EKAM and the 4th time that any images are being taken from the WORF. EKAM will have a week-long session (until 11/17) which started on 11/12 with system checkout and targeting calibration. Students around the world, anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images, will begin taking their images today by remote commanding. D2Xs batteries (3 per day) need to be fully charged for camera operation.] In preparation for his return to gravity tomorrow evening (5:26pm EST), FE-4 Yuri Malenchenko undertook Part 2 of his 5th and final exercise/training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the TVIS treadmill with Evgeny Tarelkin assisting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer). Yesterday’s ODNT run was Part 1 (not Part 2 as reported here).    [The assessment, lasting 90 min., supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance after several months in zero-G.  The closeout exercise generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -20, -25, -35, -40 mmHg (Torr) for 5 min. each, followed by -10 mmHg for 1 min., -20, -35, -40 mmHg for 10 min. each, and a final 30 mmHg for 5 min. and drop to 0 mmHg, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure, medically monitored with the Gamma-1M hardware.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] FE-6 Hoshide downloaded the accumulated data from his 4th and final 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session (11/13-11/14) from two Actiwatch Spectrums and two HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1).  The laptop was then powered off. Some science was lost due to charging failure of Makita power tool batteries.     [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.] FE-1 Novitskiy completed the regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), and also inspected the running SKV air conditioner and adjacent structural elements for moisture. Oleg & Evgeny removed, photographed & transferred the following Russian biotech payloads to Soyuz 31S for return:BTKh-29 Zhenshen-2 (Ginseng-2) in its Bioecology case #7-3 from MRM2,BTKh-41 BACTERIOFAG (Bakteriophag) in Bioecology case #8-1 from SM,BTKh-6, 7 ARIL/OChB from the +4 degC TBU-V incubator,BTKh-5 LAKTOLEN from Bioecology case #8-3, andBTKh-42 STRUKTURA (Structure). FE-3 Ford performed regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Kevin also took his first session with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MDLT (Medical Laptop Terminal) and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.     [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.] At ~10:00am EST, the three 32S (Inc-34) crewmembers Ford, Novitskiy & Tarelkin, now prime crew, teamed up for the standard one-hour Crew Emergency Roles & Responsibilities Review (peredacha smeniy po bezopasnosti), to familiarize themselves with emergency roles & responsibilities as a 3-person crew, including escape routes. Later, the crew had a ~20 min tagup with ground specialists to discuss particulars.       [Baseline emergency response actions are covered in the EMER-1 book.  Emergencies may arise due to ammonia (NH3) leak, non-ammonia toxic spills, fire or rapid depressurization.] Evgeny used the standard ECOSFERA equipment to finish up microbial air sampling runs, Part 2, for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment, with the POTOK Air Purification System temporarily powered down, taking Kit 2 samples from cabin surfaces along with samples from crewmembers for sanitation and disease studies. The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container and subsequently packed for return in Soyuz 31S.     [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger, power supply unit, and incubation tray for Petri dishes, determines microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge at one given time, the sample collection must be performed in two stages.] Yuri Malenchenko conducted the MO-22 Sanitary-Epidemiological Status check, part of the Russian MedOps program done on structures and crewmembers usually before Soyuz departures.  Malenchenko assisted.     [To monitor for microflora, Yuri collected samples from surface areas of interior panels and hardware at numerous locations in the SM, FGB, MRM1, MRM2, DC1 and ATV-3, also from himself, FE-1 Novitskiy & FE-2 Tarelkin using cotton swabs and special test tubes which were then stowed in 31S for return to the ground.] Yuri also had another ~3 hrs for packing & stowing return-to-Earth cargo on his Soyuz spacecraft. Oleg performed the periodic cleaning of Russian Potok-150МК (150 micron) pre-filters of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem. Later, FE-1 completed the routine daily & weekly servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.     [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings of SM & FGB for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers as required.] Kevin Ford & Sunita Williams filled out their standard FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MDLT. It was the 3rd time for FE-3, the 15th for Suni.   [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]  Kevin also performed routine maintenance on the four newly resupplied CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) units (##1074, 1075, 1078, 1079), checking them for sensor contamination (incomplete outgassing) and zero calibrating each monitor with sampling pumps and zero filter.    [CSA-CP is a passive cabin atmosphere monitor that provides quick response capability during a combustion event (fire). Its collected data are stored on a logger.] Afterwards, Ford configured onboard C&T (Communications & Tracking) for his CQ (Crew Quarters) as the new “On-Call” crewmember by connecting the Node-2 port-side ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) #15 to the CQ and verifying speaker functionality. CDR Sunita Williams had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in her electronic Journals on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] CDR, FE-1, & FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) on their schedule, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~5:05am, Suni at ~11:40am, Aki at ~3:00pm EST. Yuri & Suni again had an hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which is standard pre-return procedure for homecoming crewmembers. At ~11:00am, with ISS Command being transferred tonight from Williams to Ford for Increment 34, with Oleg Novitskiy & Evgeny Tarelkin as Flight Engineers, Oleg & Yuri signed two copies of the formal Russian Handover Protocol document certifying RS (Russian Segment) handover/acceptance, including the contents of Progress 49P (#416), currently docked at DC-1 nadir, MRM1 Rassvet, and MRM2 Poisk.    [The first copy remains on ISS, the second copy will be returned to the ground on Soyuz TMA-05M.  “We, the Undersigned, have executed this Protocol to the effect that Yuri Ivanovich Malenchenko, responsible for ISS-32/33 RS, handed over to Oleg Ivanovich Novitskiy, a crew member in charge of the ISS-33/34 RS who accepted the ISS RS, including the operating features and onboard system or equipment anomalies.”]  At ~2:15pm, all six crewmembers joined up for the traditional “Change of Command” ceremony, officially marking the transfer of the baton from Increment 33 to Increment 34, with Kevin Ford taking over Command from Sunita Williams who temporarily will become FE-5. The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4/2x, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2).     [CDR & FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed ARED/TVIS (cont.) and TVIS (2 min) for tomorrow. Aki’s protocol for today showed TVIS (int. 2 min.), with ARED/CEVIS for tomorrow.  Explanation: After 10 min. warmup (active, i.e., motorized): Aerobic “T2 30 sec” (passive, i.e., nonmotorized) = 7-8 sets of exercise at HRmax (max. heart rate) for 30 sec, with 15 sec rest in between.  Aerobic “T2 2 min” (motorized) = 6 sets of 2 min each at 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 90%, 80% HRmax.  Aerobic “T2 4 min” (motorized) = 4 sets of 4 min, with 3 min rest period in between. ] After completing their final CEVIS and TVIS sessions until tomorrow, Suni, Aki & Yuri will stow their exercise equipment.  Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U  to record target sites on the Earth surface,A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of Central-Eastern Atlantic (CEA), South-Eastern Atlantic (SEA) and South-East Pacific (SEP), then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, andA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. Conjunction Update:  A DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) or a Crew Shelter-in-Place considered yesterday in preparation for a conjunction with Object 81662 (Unknown) was ultimately cancelled in the morning when subsequent tracking of the object’s orbit, which had at first lowered the Pc (Probability of Collision) to a YELLOW category, later reduced it to GREEN. TCA (Time of Closest Approach) occurred yesterday at 12:54pm EST, without any issues. The USOS had been configured to perform the DAM but later was reconfigured back to support nominal operations.

All science objectives of characterization of radiation effects on shielding materials polyethylene (session#1) and Kevlar (session#2) have been confirmed completed. The session#2 collected 94 days of cumulative measurement days (of minimal 40 / preferred 60 days, no maximum acquisition duration) of science acquisition. Data validity has been confirmed by the science team.”      [Background: Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):   No report.

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BCAT-C1 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test C1, CSA):    No report.

To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report. EPM (European Physiology Module):    No report.
