ISS On-Orbit Status 05/24/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. >>> SpaceX Dragon:  Dragon this morning performed a successful Fly-Under, flying about 2.5 km beneath the ISS.  Also successful was the UHF/strobe light on/off test commanded from the ISS via CUCU, demonstrating the critically important capability to send commands to the capsule ahead of tomorrow's grappling & berthing attempt.  The ISS crew was able to see the Dragon from the ISS, and the station's cameras captured video.  Today also provided an opportunity for final training runs on the station's SSRMS robotic arm as well as time for the crew to set up displays, cameras and the Crew Command Panel ahead of capture & berthing.<<< After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-2 Revin completed his first session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.      [FE-1 Padalka stood by to assist Sergei in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit plus taking documentary photography.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] In preparation for his upcoming first ESA Ultrasound VI (Vessel Imaging) session, scheduled for 5/26 (Saturday), FE-3 Acaba reviewed briefing material, refreshing himself on Echography operational procedures, VI inflight remote guidance echo protocol, etc. FE-6 Pettit continued Part 1 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, today for the 29S crew, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to Oleg (#1003), André (#1004) & himself (#1005).  The 30S crew returned their dosimeters at wakeup after 24 hrs, followed tomorrow by the 29S crew.  After that, the dosimeters will be deployed statically in Part 2 of the protocol. Readying Node-3/Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) for Dragon arrival, FE-6 prepared external ISS truss camera viewing by calibrating the screen overlay for the P1LOOB (Port 1 Lower Outboard), P1LOIB (Port 1 Lower Inboard & S1LOOB (Starboard 1 Lower Outboard) TV cameras. CDR Kononenko continued the current round of the periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today spending ~2.5 hrs in the SM to inspect & clean “Group B2” ventilator fans & grilles. Gennady Padalka concluded his first session with the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2-1 protocol, started yesterday.     [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Anton doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.] Afterwards, it was Sergei Revin’s turn to begin his first session of the PZE MO-2-1 protocol which monitors human cardiovascular performance in the space flight environment. Joe Acaba completed his (henceforth weekly) task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch on a daily basis and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space. André, too, filled out his weekly SHD questionnaire for subsequent downlink to the ground. Don Pettit performed the periodic inspection of the ARED VIS (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device Vibration Isolation & Stabilization) rails & rollers, as well as the load adjustment crank handle witness marks. In the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), Don afterwards relocated 3 CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine) bags from the PF-1 location to the S4 Rack front.     [These bags (#2004, #2052, & #2055) are nearest to expiring.] CDR Kononenko took the Exp-31 crew, Padalka, Revin & Acaba, through the important periodic 2-hrs emergency egress drill, to familiarize them with the location of emergency hardware/equipment (including hatches and passageways), focusing particularly on the passage along the emergency evacuation route.  The OBT (Onboard Training) was followed by a ground tagup and debrief at ~12:20pm EDT. André Kuipers spent most of his workday setting up and checking out onboard equipment required for tomorrow’s Dragon Demo arrival.  Activities included –·        Reviewing material on Dragon cargo ops (cargo list, ascent cargo maps, return cargo maps, cargo transfer choreography),·        Powering on the CUCU B (COTS UHF Communication Unit B),·        Routing & checking out the CCP (Crew Command Panel) cable from the Lab to the Cupola, and·        Using CUCU after AOS (Acquisition of Signal) from Dragon and establishment of bidirectional communications for commanding the capsule’s strobe light on & off plus range monitoring. Don Pettit meanwhile visually observed Dragon capsule ops during the Fly-Under. Later, FE-5 & FE-6 took the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) through a final training session of High Hover maneuvers for the capture, with the camcorder set up to view Lab RWS Monitor 3 for ground awareness, followed by a joint Dragon capture review at ~8:35am EDT. For the actual Dragon berthing, Don later gathered the CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System) equipment from stowage in Node-2 (D4) and installed it at the Node-2 nadir port, followed by a checkout. At ~2:15pm, Joe, André & Don conducted a Dragon cargo transfer conference with ground specialists. Sergei Revin reviewed procedural material for the upcoming R&R (Removal & Replacement) of a failed SEP (EPS/Electric Power System) SNT power converter (A53, 120V/28V) in the “Zarya” FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok), scheduled tomorrow (5/25). Joe Acaba, Don Pettit & André Kuipers retrieved and signed 21 ESA Public Relations photos/cards for COL-CC (Columbus Orbital Laboratory Control Center).  The Russian cosmonauts were also invited for the signing.    [These are 10 Wernher von Braun cards & 10 Eduardo Amaldi cards, brought up by ATV-3 for ISS crew signature, to be handed out with photos by ESA PR, plus one Bachisio Dore In Memoriam card without no pictures.] CDR Kononenko took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). Oleg also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Afterwards the CDR broke out and set up the equipment for another session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis, scheduled tomorrow for him.        [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s /special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).] FE-3 closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & Kibo module windows to prevent their contamination from ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) thrusters during tomorrow’s scheduled ISS reboost. 30S crewmembers Padalka, Revin & Acaba again had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization & acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it. At ~10:15am EDT, André conducted the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with the EAC (European Astronaut Center) near Cologne /Germany. At ~12:35pm, Acaba powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 12:55pm conducted a ham radio session with students at Northland Preparatory Academy, Flagstaff, AZ, USA. At ~1:30pm, Joe had his regular weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- & Ku-band audio/video. At ~3:10pm, Don conducted the regular IMS stowage tagup with Houston stowage specialists. Don again had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] Before Presleep, Pettit will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (CDR, FE-1, FE-2).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day. Today’s exercise called for CEVIS (interval)..  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  André Kuipers performed his session on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill with the Treadmill Kinematics protocol, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video was later to be downlinked by Joe via MPC.      [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint & muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.] ISS/ATV Reboost:  Tomorrow evening (5/25) at 8:10am EDT, a one-burn ISS reboost with ATV-3 “Edoardo Amaldi” OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters will be conducted for a duration of 6 min 17 sec and a delta-V of 0.9 m/s (2.95 ft/s), resulting in a predicted mean altitude increase of 1.51 km (0.81 nmi).  Purpose of this reboost and a second one in June: to set up orbit phasing for Soyuz 29S landing (7/1).  (On 5/22 erroneously reported for last night.) CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Polar Mesopheric Clouds (PMC), North America (looking left towards the poles for these thin, silvery strands that glow.  PMC form during summer in polar regions at ~80 km altitude, far above the troposphere [upper surface at ~15 km].  Successful imaging requires viewing from the night hemisphere, looking north [left] towards the pole into the illuminated hemisphere.  Two other shooting opportunities were uplinked, but PMC may be visible from any night orbit, north of ~30 deg N.  PMC have increased in brightness in the last four decades, and are appearing further south, even observed from Colorado and Virginia.  These changes may be related to climate change), and Wetumpka Impact Crater, AL (if the crew shot overlapping images just right of track they will have acquired this subtle feature.  This 6.5 km-diameter feature lies just north of Montgomery, AL, next to the Coosa River),
