Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Mobility Unit (EMU) Resize:  Following yesterday’s EVA, the feed water switch on EMU 3010 was inadvertently switched on for 2-3 seconds.  EMU suit 3010 has been declared no-go until proper drying can be performed due to concerns of water entering the sublimator. Today,  FE-3 Hopkins and FE-5 Mastracchio resized their suits such that Hopkins will wear EMU 3005 and Mastracchio will wear EMU 3011.  Additionally, both crewmembers filled their backup Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garments (LCVGs).  Due to the amount of time required for resize and timeline review, US EVA #25 originally scheduled for Monday, December 23 has been rescheduled for Tuesday, December 24.
US EVA 25 Procedure and Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) Review: Hopkins, Mastracchio, and FE-6 Wakata performed a review of Tuesday’s EVA and Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) procedures.  The crew used the DOUG software to view the translation and robotics operation paths.  Following the reviews, the crew conducted a conference with ground specialists.
