ISS On-Orbit Status 06/16/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty. After wakeup, Sergei Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-5 André Kuipers conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. The six Exp-31 crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP). FE-2 Revin handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) at F5, André Kuipers terminated the loading of the ER-4 RIC (EXPRESS Rack 4 Rack Interface Controller) with new software, shutting off and breaking down the A31p & ER-4 T61p laptop computers, reconfiguring the T61p and reactivating it. After closing the window shutters in the Cupola to establish good thermal control environment for IR (Infrared) operations, Don Pettit used the EVA IR camera to take thermal imagery of the Cupola windows.  Window heater on/off switching was performed by MCC-H ground control. In the MRM2 Poisk module, Gennady Padalka continued the twice-daily checking of vacuum/pressure conditions in the Plasma Chamber of the KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall-3 plus) Telescience payload.       [The PK-3+ equipment comprises the EB (Eksperimental’nyj Blok) Experiment Module with a turbopump for evacuation, Ts laptop, video monitor, vacuum hoses, electrical circuitry, four hard storage disks for video, and one USB stick with the control application.  The experiment is performed on plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber.  Main objective is to obtain a homogeneous plasma dust cloud at various pressures and particle quantities with or without superimposition of an LF (low frequency) harmonic electrical field.  The experiment is conducted in automated mode.  PK-3+ has more advanced hardware and software than the previously used Russian PKE-Nefedov payload.] Don Pettit & Joe Acaba had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] At ~9:00am EDT, Joe activated the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) routing to downlink the recording of his CFE VG2 (Capillary Flow Experiments / Vane Gap 2) experiment session of 6/13, stopping it at ~1:35pm. CDR & FE-2 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~6:20am, Sergei at ~8:00am. At ~10:20am, the entire crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. Tasks listed for Kononenko, Revin & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic, coastal Africa, South-Eastern Pacific, and coastline of South America, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,·        Recording high-resolution video with the SONY HVR-Z7E to be used in a joint project of Roskosmos TV Studio with Karusel (Carousel) TV Channel for children ages 8 to 12 years, the “It’s Time to go to space!” program, which has a segment where Russian cosmonauts are discussing their work &, answer viewers’ questions; the footage was then to be downlinked to TsUP-Moscow,·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). Weekly Science Update (Expedition Thirty-One – Week 6). 2D NANO Template (JAXA):     Mission completed. 3D SPACE:    Complete. ALTCRISS (Alteino Long Term monitoring of Cosmic Rays on the ISS):    Complete. ALTEA SHIELD (NASA/ASI):     The first measurement session has started right away after the setup of the instrument last Friday (6/8).  To date, 6 cumulative days of measurements have been performed. Session#1 must be pursued for minimum 40 cumulative days.      [Cosmic radiation consists of very small, atomic-sized particles that are flying around in space at tremendous speeds.  Their energy is so high that these particles, like tiny bullets, can permeate through the complete structure of the ISS.  Exposure of astronauts to cosmic radiation is risky from a medical point of view.  The best way to protect our astronauts against cosmic radiation is to build the complete ISS from lead!  This would solve the problem but the enormous mass can impossibly be launched into space.  Therefore different materials, much lighter than lead, are being tested to be used as shielding materials.  Two of those will be investigated in the ALTEA-SHIELD experiment.  The effectiveness of the shielding materials will be measured on board by a set of special radiation detectors.  Some detectors will be covered with tiles made of shielding materials, some others will not.  We are looking forward to find out what difference it will make!”] Amine Swingbed (NASA):      No report.

BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):      In the first series of tests, we conducted four burns with a new 2-cm diameter sphere of PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) in the normal configuration.  Based on earlier results, we decided to move the sample 2.5 cm closer to the nitrogen nozzle to facilitate extinguishment.  A flame was established at a flow speed of 10 cm/s, and then the flow was reduced to a minimal value (around 1 cm/s).  The flame remained very dim blue and spread quite slowly around the sphere.  The nitrogen was turned on after a few minutes, and the flame extinguished in the stagnation region but remained stabilized on the sides even with maximum nitrogen flow.  After a minute, the nitrogen was turned off and the flame slowly spread back toward the stagnation region.  Finally, the flow was turned off and the flame extinguished.  In the remaining three tests, Don adjusted the sphere location to improve the framing of the image by moving it 1 cm downstream.  Ignition was achieved at 10 cm/s air flow, and then the air flow was again gradually reduced to a minimal value (around 1 cm/s).  A very stable, dim blue flame was obtained for these tests.  The reduction of soot in the flame is desirable for comparisons to the model, and we appreciate Don’s careful efforts to adjust the air flow to a very low value.  In the second series of tests, Joe Acaba burned a 1-cm diameter PMMA sphere in the normal configuration.  Four tests were planned and successfully attained.  Ignition was achieved at 10 cm/s airflow, and the flow was reduced to around 1 cm/s after the flame was established.   The sphere was completely consumed at the conclusion of the fourth test.  The smaller spheres yield yellower flames in general, though at the lowest flow speeds the flames do become blue.   In future tests with the small spheres, we will attempt to get ignition at a smaller air flow value to reduce the initial flame strength.  We appreciate Joe's efforts in successfully completing the test points on his first day of BASS operations. BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.       [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BLB (Biolab, ESA):     No report.

[Background:  In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food.] ENose (Electronic Nose):   No report.
