ISS On-Orbit Status 03/19/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Underway: Week 17 of Increment 30 (six-person crew). After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-1 also completed the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture. FE-2 Ivanishin worked with the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for CO (Carbon Monoxide) contamination in the SM, recording the measurements and updating the CO sensor coefficient for calibration.     [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C8H10), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur Dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, Ozone, Acetic Acid, Ammonia, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrous Oxides, Acetone, Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, etc.] CDR Burbank spent several hours on the periodic water sampling activities for Week 27, including –·        “Week 27” water sampling from the WRS (Water Recovery System) potable water in the SM for chemical & microbial analysis, using a specific water sample collection packet from stowage;   [collected were two 500 mL post-flight sample from the SVO-ZV & SRV-K ports for return on 28S and three 125 mL microbial in-flight samples from the SVO-ZV and SRV-K-Hot & -Warm ports],·        The periodic (approx. weekly) WRS sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose;  [after the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged], and·        “Week 27” water sample collecting in Node-3 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient port for microbial inflight & TOCA analysis plus a post-flight sample for return on Soyuz 28S;   [from Ambient: 1 TOCA in-flight sample (250 mL), 1 post-flight sample (500 mL) & 1 microbial in-flight sample (125 mL).  The in-flight samples were subsequently processed in the MCD (Microbial Capture Device) and CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection.  After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Later, Burbank also worked on the WRS-2 Rack in Node-3 (at loc. D4), flushing process line D and then taking a 300 mL sample of the effluent from the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) Multifiltration Bed #2, accessing via line D on the WRS-2 RIP (Rack Interface Panel). Afterwards, the CDR changed out the TOCA WWB (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer Waste Water Bag). In the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit relocated CWC-Is (Collapsible Water Containers-Iodinated) and hardware from PMM rack fronts to space behind the RSP (Resupply Stowage Platform) at PMM loc. F2 and also retrieved RFTAs (Recycle Filter Tank Assemblies) for future activities and CWCs to be staged for Russian use.    André Kuipers later replaced the full RFTA in the Node-3 WRS-2 with a spare RFTA, stowing the used unit.       [RFTAs collect the substances cleaned from the pretreated urine by the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) as it turns it into water.  They need to be replaced when filled and constitute an important resupply item from the ground.] Preparatory to the planned launch of more Russian Luch (Altair) communications satellites, Oleg Kononenko used the FSH3 spectrum analyzer to perform another characterization test on the Lira antenna feeder, taking parameter measurements via S-band & VHF.     [The Lira system is a two-way communication system between the ISS RS and TsUP Mission Control via the Russian Luch relay satellite system (when it is complete).  The RS comm subsystem can receive commands directly from RGS (Russian Ground Station) through the Regul subsystem and can receive commands from the Luch satellite through Lira or Regul.  Efforts are underway to rebuild the Luch relay satellite system after many years of funds-related absence.  Luch-5A was successfully launched on a Proton on 12/11/2011.  Luch-5B & Luch 4 are scheduled for launch this year and 2013.  This should provide the RS with 45 minutes of coverage per orbit via Lira and Regul.] Afterwards, Oleg used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 and the overnight freshly charged FSS photo spectrograph battery, taking pictures of targets along the flight track during a one-hour segment, covering water& coastal area of ​​the Bay of Biscay (Atlantic Ocean), the island of Sicily, Mount Etna (the vent of the volcano, and if the volcano is active, the plume), the Aswan Dam reservoir. Nasser (Egypt) and the waters of the coastal zone of the Red Sea and Indian Ocean.       [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module & MRI Image Recording Module.] In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-5 Kuipers supported ground-commanded science research in the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility), first activating MSPR (Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack) communications components and then installing MEU B (Measurement Experiment Unit B ) units, one in the CBEF Micro-G IU (Incubation Unit) and four in the 1G IU.        [Components activated (later deactivated) in the MSPR were the VRU (Video Compression & Recording Unit), the Hub and the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter).  Several hours later, the MEU Bs were removed again and stowed.] Shkaplerov & Ivanishin joined up for half an hour of preparation & execution of another session with the Russian experimental OBR-5 (Obrazovanie-5, Education 5) project VELIKOE NACHALO (“Great Beginning”), which addresses uplinked questions and comments from the Russian public on matters concerning human space flight, today using the Sony HVR-Z7E camcorder #1 to focus on Russian individual protection equipment for radiation and methods to control received radiation level.        [Goal of this experiment is to develop a method to promote the accomplishments of national piloted cosmonautics using digital IT (information technology), for which RSC Energia has created a “Planet Korolev” website (http://gagarin.energia.ru/ ).  The public inputs were/are the results of a questionnaire on this website.  One interesting comment was the suggestion to create an Internet portal on which all still living participants of the first human space flight post their recollections.  “This it is must to our descendants.”] Kononenko & Shkaplerov also had ~1.5 hrs set aside for recording high-resolution video with the SONY HVR-Z7E to be used in a joint project of Roskosmos TV Studio with Karusel (Carousel) TV Channel for children ages 8 to 12 years, the “It’s Time to go to space!” program, which has a segment where Russian cosmonauts are discussing their work &, answer viewers’ questions (currently they are working on a New Year episode).  The footage was then to be downlinked to TsUP-Moscow, With the video camcorder set up in the Lab for documentary coverage, André worked another NanoRacks Module 17 activity, performing full experiment routine on the working Smartphone (#1002).  Dan took documentary still photography.       [The NanoRacks Smartphone-1 malfunction encountered earlier by André was due to a damaged voltage regulator in the iPhone battery pack, under-powering the device.  Additional data collection was necessary from the Sensor Calibration subexperiment.  For this, André required a set of fresh AAA batteries which were delivered on Progress 46P and made available to the NanoRacks operation on short notice by Russian consent.  These fresh batteries compensated for the faulty voltage regulator, yielding good science.  Today’s activity was the final attempt on this Smartphone, with the four fresh batteries thought to be adequate for running the software end-to-end, as originally planned.]  At ~11:55am EDT, André started the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) to downlink playback video from the NanoRack activities.  POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) routed the on-board HRDL system. After performing visual inspection of the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility and activating it, Don Pettit configured the SLICE (Structure & Liftoff In Combustion Experiment) pyrometry hardware and performed the 10th flame test operation, today doing SLICE & SPICE testing with the remaining 70% methane & 100% propane.   Later, FE-6 ran the flame tests one more time, with a new burner installed.  Before powering off, Pettit performed SLICE fan calibration to evaluate the air flow.  MSG was later deactivated again.       [The research goal is to gain unique data to extend scientists’ predictive capability.  Earth application: Increased efficiency and reduced pollutant emission for practical combustion devices, improved numerical modeling, hence improved design tools, hence improved practical combustion on Earth (currently, the good modeling-experiment agreement breaks down when flames are lean or heavily sooting).  Measurements: still images (with camera that was blackbody calibrated for pyrometry), video & radiometer.  Hardware:  SLICE is conducted in the MSG using the SPICE hardware.] In the SM, FE-4 Kononenko made preparations for tomorrow’s scheduled R&R (removal & replacement) of the SA-325-I transmitter unit of the Regul-OS, gathering equipment & tools.       [Located in the SM, Regul-OS is a subsystem of the RSUS Radio Control & Comm System of the RS (Russian Segment) for handling two-way voice communication, digital command/program information, and telemetry transmission via Russian RGS (Groundsites).   Regul is the nominal uplink channel for all Russian commands; operating at a low data rate, it is equivalent to the US S-band system.   The SA-325 block to be removed tomorrow is one of three redundant transmitters, each containing a transceiver (PPA) and Digital Processor (UtsO).] Also in the SM, FE-2 Ivanishin configured the Lulin-ISS radiation hardware for operation, also setting up its four dosimeters for recharge.  The planned health check of Lulin-ISS to allow extending its operations warranty is scheduled tomorrow.     [Lulin-ISS is a part of the complex Matryoshka suite designed for sophisticated radiation studies.]  Working in the Soyuz TMA-22/28S (#232) spacecraft, docked at MRM2 Poisk, Anton Shkaplerov performed the periodic cleaning of the screen of the spacecraft’s BVN air heater.  FE-1 also activated the GA/gas analyzer (KM0305M1) in the Soyuz 28S. FE-4 Kononenko turned on the GA in “his” Soyuz TMA-03M/29S (#703), docked at MRM1 Rassvet.  The GA’s will be deactivated on 3/22.    [The GA’s are activated periodically to check the cabin air in the Descent Modules.] Dan Burbank’s scheduled regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations CMO OBT (Crew Medical Officer On-Board Training) drill was deferred to a later date.        [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] In the Lab, with the WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) shutter remaining open, André continued troubleshooting on the ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera), powering on the ISSAC T61p laptop, verifying its BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) settings, checking for error messages, deleting pending commands, and copying log files to a USB memory stick for OCA downlink. Don Pettit printed out new uplinked procedures and replaced the sheets in the Leak Pinpoint & Repair Kit stowed in PMA-1 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 1).      [Updated were the procedures pertaining to JEM rack rotation.] Anton performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Anatoly took on the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-2 also completed the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS treadmill.    [This is primarily an inspection of the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time & date values.] Working jointly, Anton & Anatoly had 1.5 hrs set aside for more stowing of excessed equipment & trash on the cargo ship-turned-trash can Progress 46P, to be disposed of by incineration during atmospheric reentry on 4/29. Pettit again had a time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.        [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-2, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).       [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2, with T2, ARED+T2 & CEVIS following in the next 3 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –·        A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Allalin Glacier, Darwin Island, and the volcanoes Cleveland, Hierro, Mt Etna & Stromboli,·        A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and·        More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
