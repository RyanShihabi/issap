New Status:
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Mobility Unit (EMU) S/N 3011 Troubleshooting: FE-5 Parmitano performed a subset of the Airlock deconfiguration procedure following yesterday’s EVA by cleaning and stowing the prebreathe masks and returning the emergency books to their nominal location.  He then began troubleshooting the EMU he wore yesterday during the EVA.  Preliminary results of the troubleshooting tests indicate that water is likely being introduced into the oxygen ventilation circuit of the EMU.  Today the crew performed a dry out of the EMU loop. Ground teams continue discussing forward troubleshooting plans to isolate the exact source of the water.
Post-EVA Cleanup: FE-3 Cassidy  performed a nominal dump and fill of the feedwater tanks in the EMU he used during yesterday’s EVA (S/N 3010).
Recycle Tank Remove and Replace (R&R): FE-6 Nyberg completed a nominal Recycle Tank R&R.  The removed tank was then drained to a water container [ЕДВ] for stowage.
Payload Cleanup: Nyberg performed cleanup of the Advanced Biology Research System (ABRS) and Mice Drawer System (MDS) payload  facilities in advance of upcoming payloads using these facilities.
