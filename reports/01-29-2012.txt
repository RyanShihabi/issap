ISS On-Orbit Status 01/29/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Crew off duty.   Ahead:  Week 10 of Increment 30 (six-person crew). After wakeup this morning, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Dan Burbank, André Kuipers & Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 22nd for Dan, the 15th for André and Don.  The three crewmembers are performing their RST sleep shift session starting on 1/24 and every day through 2/2.        [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov, FE-2 Ivanishin, FE-4 Kononenko, FE-5 Kuipers & FE-6 Pettit joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).         ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly & Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. Anton Shkaplerov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.  This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for calldown.       [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers]. Pettit completed the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. Both Burbank & Kuipers completed their (currently) daily electronic logging of diet for the High Salt Diet protocol of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included), the crewmember is ingesting one of two special diets (low salt & high salt content).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 & 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged & inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 & MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.  SOLO was also part of the experiments done on the recent Russian Mars500 long-duration flight simulation.] At ~5:45am EST, André turned on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and started the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the CFE VG1, Spheres Zero Robotics and Nanoracks activities to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about 15.5 hrs, FE-5 will turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] André also opened the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & Kibo Lab windows which had been closed for last night’s reboost firing. At ~8:00am EST, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. CDR, FE-1, FE-4 & FE-5 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Dan at ~2:40am, André at ~3:10am, Anton at ~4:45am, Oleg at ~6:20am EST. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6),  T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the Volcanoes Santa Maria, Fuego, San Cristobal, Arenal, Poas, Galeras, Reventador, Tanguraua, Sangay, Hudson, and the glaciers of Patagonia,A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Eastern Pacific, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andA video recording by the cosmonauts to be used in a joint project of Roskosmos TV Studio with Karusel (Carousel) TV Channel for children ages 8 to 12 years, the “It’s Time to go to space!” program, which has a segment where Russian cosmonauts are discussing their work &, answer viewers’ questions (currently they are working on a New Year episode).  The footage was then to be downlinked to TsUP-Moscow, and No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today. DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) + Reboost:    The DAM/reboost burn was performed nominally last night at 6:50pm EST using the SM Main thrusters for 1m 4s.  Achieved were a Delta-V of 1.11 m/s (planned: 1.0 m/s), increasing mean altitude by 1.90 km (planned: 1.75 km).  After the burn, ISS was at 391.7 km mean altitude, with 404.8 km apogee height and 378.6 perigee height.   The purpose of the reboost was to avoid a series of conjunctions with Object 30502 (Fengyun 1C Debris), and to set up phasing for the future trajectory events.  This reboost replaced the previously planned reboost on 2/1. Software Upgrading:  Today the ground temporarily deactivated the Node-2 CCAA (Common Cabin Air Assembly) in support of the N2-2 R3 software load.  During this time the crew was “prime” for smoke detection in Node 2.  Between 9:00am and 3:00pm EST, the ground is loading software to and transitioning the N2-2 EXT & N2-1 MDMs (Multiplexer/Demultiplexer) computers.  Tomorrow, the same will take place at these times for the S3-1 & P3-2 MDMs, as well as to the Backup EXT MDM.

[Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     No report.

In an average day we get to use, handle or drink water or other liquids.  And everybody knows how fluids (that is liquids and gases) behave: when subjected to a net force, may be pressure, a temperature difference or gravity, they can move freely.  Scientists have been studying how fluids move for centuries, and managed to write mathematical formulas that can describe and predict such movements. Unfortunately, these equations are extremely complex and only approximate solutions are known. As a result, our quantitative understanding of fluid movement is just partial. This is especially true for natural phenomena where the forces can be enormous and unpredictable, like in oceans or in the atmosphere. Or the interior of the earth, where rocks are exposed to pressures and temperatures so incredibly high that they slowly move and adapt their shape. That is, over hundreds of years rocks flow just like a very viscous liquid. Scientists try to study such flows but cannot observe them directly due to the fact that they take place deep beneath the surface of our planet. The only way is to have computers simulating those movements starting from the equations, but how to check whether computers are correct? This is what Geoflow II is trying to answer on board the International Space Station. Geoflow II is a miniature planet that has some of its essential ingredients: a fluid can freely move inside a spherical container that rotates, has temperature differences and has a simulated gravity directed towards the centre just like in a real planet. By taking pictures of the fluid  movements, scientists are able to understand the essential characteristics of the flows and determine whether computer simulations are correct or whether they need to be refined and improved towards a better understanding of the elusive movements that take place inside our planet.] HAIR (JAXA):      On 1/20, you completed first sample collection for Andre and Don.

As the brain is a master organ where major crucial processes take place, it is fundamental to understand how it manages adaptation for living in Space.  One of the main purposes of Neurospat (NES) experiment is to focus on how microgravity environment influences cerebral activity of astronauts aboard ISS.  For this, the global electrical activity of the brain of the astronaut is measured thanks to electroencephalogram (EEG) technique, while he or she is executing specific tasks through a computer as if it was a kind of videogame.  In practice, the astronaut is wearing a specially equipped cap with passive, gel filled electrodes that are in contact with his/her scalp while he or she is performing the specific tasks that we have designed.  These are visual-orientation perception and visuo-motor tracking tasks that may be encountered on a daily basis.  The tasks allow the study of 5 cognitive processes: Perception, Attention, Memorization, Decision and Action.  Besides there are also task-irrelevant images that are showed to the astronaut in order to assess how well he or she processes novel visual stimuli.  The electrodes all over the scalp are linked to sensitive amplifiers that allow us to measure small variations of electrical potential between different regions of the scalp.  These signals are in turn used to estimate activity in the cerebral cortex related to the task being performed.  Also, they serve to identify the mental processes associated with these tasks and to localize in the brain the sources of the underlying neural activity.  After analysis of the data we can better understand whether the novel environment of microgravity accompanied by a multitude of stressors may place an increased load on the cognitive capacity of the human brain and whether the sensory signals and motor responses of astronauts are processed and interpreted differently because a new reference frame.] NOA-1/-2 (Nitric Oxide Analyzer, ESA):    Complete.

A series of experiments on T-cells and other immune system cells have been previously performed by different scientific teams on Space Shuttle and the ISS over the last 30 years.  The data from these individual experiments provides information which together can be used to understand the mechanisms by which gravity or the absence of gravity can affect T-cell function.] Robonaut (NASA):    No report.

SODI/COLLOID (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument/Colloid):       No report. SODI-DSC (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument/Diffusion & Soret Coefficient, ESA):      The science team analyzed the last runs and informed us that unfortunately 4 of them suffered from mode hopping of the laser and are not useful. Therefore, at the end, 37 out of 55 runs were confirmed to be valid, thanks to the post-processing algorithm which drastically improves the image quality (2 runs are pending confirmation as no data are available on-ground due to FD exchange). The near-future plans with SODI-DSC are being discussed with the science team.        [Background:  Fluids and gases are never at rest. This statement is in apparent contradiction with our experience: when we pour water in a glass and wait until all flows have disappeared and the temperature of the liquid is in equilibrium with that of the room, we see that water appears to be completely at rest. However, if we were able to see the individual molecules of water with a very powerful microscope, we would discover that they are incessantly moving and collide with each other following frantic, random paths even if the liquid appears to be quiescent at naked eye. Scientists are interested in observing and measuring such movements because they reveal important, practical information: how fast does heat propagates in a fluid? How fast do liquid mixtures mix? Such phenomena occur in absence of a macroscopic flow, that is when the fluid appears to be at rest, and are called heat and mass diffusion respectively. While the theoretical prediction of heat and mass diffusion is still quite challenging, its measurement is a standard laboratory practice, but may become extremely difficult or impossible when dealing with mixtures of many liquids, due to the fact that such measurement needs to be carried out when the fluid is quiescent, a condition sometimes impossible to achieve on ground. This is precisely the objective of the SODI DSC experiment carried out on board the International Space Station: the measurement of diffusion in mixtures of liquids. By using very sensitive optical techniques, it will be possible to measure mass diffusion, compare with current theories, and improve our present understanding of how molecules move in liquid mixtures. The results will be used by the large team of scientists involved in the project to try to understand which of the many existing theories for mass diffusion is correctly predicting the experimental behavior.] SOLAR (Solar Monitoring Observatory, ESA):        Sun Visibility Window #49 started on 1/22 with Sun measurements for SOLSPEC and SolACES, which enabled us to capture the big solar storm event of last days. From 1/21 until 1/25 SolACES was put in heating configuration for the 45P undocking event. SOLSPEC performed daily Sun and calibration measurements since the start of the Sun Visibility Window. SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity):    “Dear Dan and André, we appreciate the review of your Big Picture words. We are much looking forward to your participation to the SOLO activities coming up soon.

Space Food (JAXA):    No report. SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellite):     “Don, you did a remarkable job executing the international SPHERES Zero Robotics High School Competition for both Europe and the USA.  You completed 16 different test runs, yielding the CyberAvo Alliance as the European Champion and the Rocket Alliance as the US Champion.  The CyberAvo Alliance consisted of 3 schools from Turin, Italy and Berlin, Germany.  The Rocket Alliance consisted of three schools from Clarksville, MD, Branchburg, NJ, and Rockledge, FL.-- Dear André and Don, we cannot thank you enough for your time during the SPHERES event which also comprised as you know several European teams.  All the finalists gathered in ESTEC accompanied by their school teachers, press and in the case of Turin, the local minister of education.  The day was divided into several tours of Erasmus highbay, some movie highlights of past missions and your December launch as well as a tech tour of the test facilities.  The afternoon focused on the live link and the games.  The atmosphere was electric in the run up to the link and the suspense during the LOS during the score read-out was a real killer!  All in all, the students had a fantastic time they all want to come back again next year.  I hope you both enjoyed yourselves also, it's fantastic what you both did along with MIT and NASA for the European students!  In a separate worksheet, you will find a couple of pics for your viewing pleasure.” SPHINX (SPaceflight of Huvec: an Integrated eXperiment, ESA):    No report.

Good luck finding the red sharpie!” SS-HDTV (Super Sensitivity High Definition Camera, JAXA):     No report. STP-H3 (Space Test Program – Houston 3):      The STP-H3 team is reviewing the video from the survey using the SSRMS on 1/19.  The video did reveal damage to VADER Variable Emissivity Device #3 and further study might provide insight into what caused this damage.  VADER is no longer doing any testing of the VEDs due to the discovery of the damage.  VADER will evaluate whether any further testing of other VEDs can be done for scientific gain or would it be best to cease operations of this part of the experiment entirely.  VADER will continue to characterize the performance of the Aerogel blanket attached to the backside.  MHTEX is currently repriming the system to prepare for a new series of tests.  Canary took data from the 45P propellant purge and undocking events.  Canary plans to collect data during the docking of 46P later this week.  DISC has taken more imagery this week and is processing images that were taken in previous weeks.

VESSEL IMAGING (ESA):      “Don, the VESSEL IMAGING team appreciated much your efforts in getting as much of the additional scans this week. It is confirmed that we have acquired the missing science data from the first session performed on 1/6.”      [Background:  It is known that the ability of blood vessels to vasoconstrict - the ability of the muscular vessel wall to narrow the diameter of the blood vessel - is impaired during and after a human has been in space.  "Vessel Imaging" is using the Ultrasound scanner on board the ISS to take images of the five different blood vessels in the lower abdomen and in the legs to study what changes occur to cause the blood vessels to be less able to vasoconstrict. For each vessel, a 5 second scan is performed to observe the blood vessel during several heart beats, followed by a scan where the ultrasound scan-head is tilted to allow a "cut through the blood vessel wall".  The same scans are also performed before flight, and these pre-flight images are used as the baseline to which the in-flight data is compared with. The images are analyzed to detect any changes in the blood vessel wall properties, such as wall thickness, elasticity or structure, changes in the size of the blood vessel or blood flow (volume) while the crewmember is in orbit.] VIABLE  (eValuatIon And monitoring of microBiofiLms insidE the ISS Payload Touch, NASA):    No report.
