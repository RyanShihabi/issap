Double Cold Bag (DCB) Packing: ISS CDR Swanson and FE-1 Skvortsov packed six DCBs with conditioned science samples for return on SpaceX-3.
SpaceX-3 Departure Preparations:  Swanson completed the final SpaceX-3 cargo loading.  He then completed the SpaceX-3 egress and vestibule closeout procedures, including installation of the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) Controller Panel Assemblies (CPAs).  Finally, he configured the Robotics Work Station (RWS) cameras. SpaceX-3 unberth is scheduled at 6:40am CDT tomorrow with release scheduled at 8:26am CDT.
CBM Bolt 3-1 Checkout:  After Swanson installed the CBM CPAs, the ground team checked out CBM Bolt 3-1, which had failed during SpaceX-3 berthing operations and was subsequently changed out.  The bolt was fully retracted to confirm the initial configuration. It was then driven and retracted to verify nominal operation.  Bolt 3-1 will be masked to support SpaceX-3 demate.
