ISS On-Orbit Status 10/15/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – Crew off duty. At wake-up, CDR Mike Fossum & FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.        [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.] FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. Sergei Volkov completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] Mike, Sergei & Satoshi joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. Fossum filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC.        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] Volkov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.        [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] With both ERB2 (Erasmus Recording Binocular 2) batteries freshly charged and lights switched on in the cabin, Fossum conducted a “Flythrough” of the ISS, taking HD 3D video with the ERB2 camera from Node-1 through PMA-1 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 1), FGB, and SM and back. Working a VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) task for the JAXA EPO (Educational Payload Operations) program, Satoshi Furukawa prepared Reports Nr. 14 & Nr. 15, i.e., written short reports showing ordinary life in space which, as is expected, will attract children and the general public's attention for future human space exploration.       [JAXA EPO Report 14, for THE MAINICHI papers (07), had as topic "Whether mankind (so-called ordinary people) can settle down in space in the future, what kinds of medical (psychological and physical) issues are being considered in such cases and how the stay on the ISS helps overcome those issues", while Report 15, also for MAINICHI newspapers (08), had "Review of his first stay in space" as topic.] At ~5:40am EDT, Satoshi powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, & power supply) and at 5:45am conducted a ham radio session with students at school with students at the Amateur Radio Morioka Club, Morioka, Japan. At ~7:50am, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~10:40am, Sergei Volkov had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5). Tasks listed for Sergei Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the mountain peaks of the Andes and Patagonia ice fields, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.

BCAT-4/5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 4/5):     The second Harvard University, Phase Separation sample (number 5), in BCAT-5 was completed on 10/11.  The images are nearly flawless (no shadow, bubbles, or focus imperfections).  The evolution of phase separation is clearly visible without post processing by the science team.  The Phase Separation specialty of Soft Condensed Matter Physics answers commercial questions about what model should be used for the design of and for predicting the shelf life of consumer and medical products. This is the last sample for BCAT-5. We have included some images that show the evolution of the sample as it phase separates. This evolution (change of state/phase) is difficult to observe on earth due to sedimentation of the particles.  On orbit in microgravity it occurs over many days and is much more easily observed.

CEO (Crew Earth Observation):      Through 10/11, the ground has received 16,798 CEO frames for review and cataloging.  “We are pleased to report your acquisition of imagery this week with times corresponding to those of our CEO Daily Target Lists for the following targets:  Aurora Australis - an automated session - the display was much less significant than we had anticipated; Ampato Glaciers, Peru - a long session is still under evaluation for content; Mbabane, Swaziland - site was not identifiable in your imagery - more clouds were present than anticipated; Kerguelen Islands, S. Indian Ocean - several frames acquired of the southwestern part of this archipelago - again clouds were heavier than anticipated; Ubinas Volcano, Peru - long session includes several good views of other volcanoes in the area; and Lake Poopo, Bolivia - no images of the target were obtained, probably because of the cloudiness you reported at that time.  These targets will remain on our list and we will continue to request them as viewing opportunities occur. Thanks for your extra effort to notify us of your attempts at our targets.  This helps us to anticipate when key imagery for cataloging will become available.  Your first-ever ISS image of the Bigach Impact Crater, Kazakhstan was published on the NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website recently.  This barely-visible impact site has eluded crews for several years now, but your excellent context view will help to acquire more detailed imagery in the future.  Kudos to the crew for a very useful image!  One more neat application of the time-lapse videos of your imagery has been reported to us:  Two of these videos have been included in a visual backdrop to be premiered with a performance of the Pacific Symphony in Orange, CA next week.” CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Southeastern USA (night imagery pass) (if the crew had the opportunity, they were to try night imaging [starting in Nebraska] of cities in the Mississippi R. valley and Gulf of Mexico coastline should have been good), and Nile Valley, Red Sea, Mesopotamia (night imagery pass), (the crew’s prior night sequences suggest forward-looking imagery with short lenses could capture wide swaths of night lights in the Middle East.   If the crew had the opportunity, Nile valley and Tigris–Euphrates cities should have been clear.  Looking somewhat off track will show lights of cities on the east coast of the Mediterranean and the very bright Persian Gulf cities.  Caspian cities predicted under cloud).
