Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 30:  Wilmore and Virts egressed the airlock at 5:51am CST. During the 6 hour, 43 minute EVA they accomplished the following objectives:

Removed Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA)-2 Cover
Completed routing of cables associated with International Docking Adapter (IDA)-1
Lubricated Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Latching End Effector (LEE) A (Ball screws and linear bearings)
Performed Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) and Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) preparations.

The following get-ahead tasks were also completed:

LEE A Equalization Bracket and Latch Deployment Rollers inspection and lube
C2V2 wire tie deploy
C2V2 Rats nest wire tie

Upon reentry, Cristoforetti observed water inside Virts’ helmet. The crew measured ~15 mL of free standing water within the helmet for EMU 3005. This amount did not include moisture that was absorbed in the Helmet Absorption Pad (HAP) or water that escaped during helmet removal.  Ground teams will investigate to confirm the source of the water and if it is normal discharge.
