ISS On-Orbit Status 08/28/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. After wakeup and breakfast, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. Padalka later conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] FE-2 Sergei Revin serviced the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, extracting the top of the bioreactor (#6) from the TBU-V incubator (+29 degC), shaking it with “moderately strong” movements for 2 minutes without taking it out of the case and inserting it again in TBU-V.      [Started on 8/23, this activity is being carried out for 21 days, once in the morning and once in the evening.] After setting up the necessary equipment, FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Williams & FE-6 Hoshide took turns being subject and operator of their first session with the periodic 30-min US PHS (Periodic Health Status)/Without Blood Labs exam, with Aki acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) for Joe & Suni, and Suni then as CMO for Aki.  FE-6 logged the data and stowed the equipment.  A subjective evaluation was part of the test.  It was Suni’s & Aki’s 2nd, Joe’s 3rd session.        [The assessment used the AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack), stethoscope, oral disposable thermometer and ABPC (Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff) from the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack).  All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.  The PHS exam is guided by special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.] Revin conducted the routine verification of yesterday’s automated refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2.      [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the SSCV4 software update some time ago.  Before the installation on 8/8/11 of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.] Hoshide started another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.        [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.] Padalka, Revin & Acaba donned their intravehicular Sokol pressure suits and performed the standard fit-check in their body-contoured Kazbek-U couches in the TMA-04M/30S spacecraft, docked at MRM2 Poisk, a 30-min job.      [This required them to get in their shock-absorbing seats and use a ruler to measure the gap between the top of the head and the top edge of the structure facing the head.  The results were to be reported to TsUP.  Kazbek-U couches are designed to withstand g-loads during launch and orbital insertion as well as during reentry and brake-rocket-assisted landing.  Each seat has two positions: cocked (armed) and non-cocked. In the cocked position, they are raised to allow the shock absorbers to function during touchdown.  The fit check assures that the crewmember whose body gains in length during longer-term stay in zero-G, will still be adequately protected by the seat liners for their touchdown in Kazakhstan.  30S return is scheduled for 9/16.] In preparation for their 9/16 return to Earth, Gennady & Sergei completed their first (preliminary) orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test sessions with the Russian Chibis-M (“Lapwing”) suit by conducting the MedOps MO-4 exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill, assisting each other in turn as CMO.  The exercise was supported by ground specialist tagup.            [The Chibis-M provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by one cycle of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -35, -40 and -45 mmHg for five min. each, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG SHKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis-M data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis-M suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] After reviewing briefing material on the DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) experiment and retrieving a T61p laptop from the “pantry”, Suni set it up in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), connected power & data cables and configured it for DTN operations.      [This experiment will establish the initial communications network for follow-on telerobotics studies, primarily led by ESA.  It is the first international flight experiment that uses delay/disruption-tolerant networking, which is a model for future cooperation in exploration.  Background: Delay/disruption-tolerant networking is an approach to computer network architecture with communication lines that may not have continuous network connectivity, resulting in a lack of instantaneous end-to-end paths. Examples of such networks are those operating in mobile or extreme terrestrial environments, or planned networks in space.  Many DTN projects have to date been funded by DARPA.  As opposed to routing protocols which first establish a complete route before forwarding actual data, DTN deals with communications where instantaneous end-to-end paths are difficult or impossible to establish.  These routing protocols must take to a "store and forward" approach, where data is incrementally moved and stored throughout the network in hopes that it will eventually reach its destination. A common technique used to maximize the probability of a message being successfully transferred is to replicate and forward many copies of the message.] Joe Acaba activated the pumping equipment for transferring water from CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodinated) to the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) Potable Water tank using a “tee” hose and a fresh MRF (Microbial Removal Filter) cartridge as gas trap.      [During the day, with MCC-H monitoring, Joe checked transfer progress and purged gas from the MRF to allow water to flow from CWC-I to the Potable Water tank.  Several hours later, Acaba terminated the procedure and left the equipment intact for subsequent use.] Afterwards, Joe again supported activities with Robonaut, the first “human-like” robot in space, setting up the Node-2 camcorder & MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) for Lab site coverage during the subsequent powered/ground-commanded operations.  Afterwards, Joe powered the robot down and, with Sunita’s assistance, disassembled and stowed the hardware.    [Robonaut was active and in motion between 5:40am – 9:40am EDT.] FE-4 Malenchenko spent several hours in the FGB “Zarya” on major IFM (In-Flight Maintenance), removing & replacing a relay (User Adapter Relay A5, 23A288) of the FGB’s SUBK Onboard Complex Control System.    [SUBK uses 7 relay switches (UKP) to control onboard systems and components in the FGB, in one of three modes: (a) automatic (using ground commands via the Komparus system, commands from the Russian and U.S. segments, and commands generated by the SM computer), (b) program relay (backup, using Komparus and SUBK relay components), and (c) command relay (commands from the ground via the Komparus comm portal or transmitted from the SM.)]  Yuri also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur). FE-5 Williams prepared the two NIKON D2XS cameras for the EVA-18 on Thursday, initiating charging of their batteries (for at least 3 hrs) and later configuring the cameras for the spacewalk.     [One camera was changed from 28mm to 10.5 mm lens and the other remains with the 28mm objective, plus their correct focus areas were set.].  FE-6 Hoshide performed the periodic inspection of the seals of currently open USOS (US Orbit Segment) hatches.     [The inspection covered hatches at Node-1 aft, stbd, port, fwd & nadir, Node-3 nadir, Lab fwd, Lab aft, and Node-2 aft.] Akihiko also performed the dust sampling for the JAXA MICROBE-3 experiment, choosing two dusty locations in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and taking dust samples with a sampling sheet at the locations.       [Locations chosen were one each from JPM Stbd/Aft IMV (Intermodular Ventilation) panel and RLT2 (Robotics Laptop 2) lid located at A6.  Additional samples were taken in JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment) from the AS1, FS1 and GLA1 panels using Kapton tape, with documentary photos.] Later, Aki converted the SSC11 (Station Support Computer 11) laptop in Node-2 to wireless operation and moved it to the Lab as part of the laptop power chain to be used with the Lab RWS (Robotic Workstation) during SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) activities supporting EVA-18. Suni joined up with Aki in setting up and running another EPO (Education Program Operation) demo, today video-recording an introduction to the new Exploration Design Challenge by highlighting the radiation research being conducted on the ISS. Afterwards, Williams re-installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) at Lab starboard bay S3, engaged the snubber pins and locked safety pins to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances). Acaba worked on the 3 EMER-2 procedures books (Lab, FGB, SM), updating them with a note referring to the use, if needed, of the IPV (International Procedures Viewer) for the temporarily updated Lab fire source location procedures while the SPDA (Secondary Power Distribution Assembly) jumper cable is installed from 8/29-8/31.      [The note will be removed once the cable is R&R’d later in the week. The hardcopies were not to be updated.] Later, after gathering the two cables, the Lab truss contingency jumper cable & Lab SPDA jumper, from stowage in Node-1 plus checking the Node-1 cabin and behind-panel space with the CSA-O2 (Compounhd Specific Anayzer-O2) sampler to verify that O2 was within nominal range, Joe installed the truss contingency power jumper in the Lab, connecting it to the Lab S3 payload rack as power source.  Installation of the SPDA jumper is scheduled tomorrow. Padalka & Revin completed their 3rd OOHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, a 30-minute NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures and monitor crew hearing status on-orbit, using a special software application on the SSC laptop.    [The self-administered OOHA test is a variation of conventional audiometric testing, in which the crewmember determines minimum audibility for tones, over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, in each ear.  While wearing custom-made Prophonics earphones and Bose active noise reduction headsets, the crewmember uses special EarQ software on the SSC to determine the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The first on-orbit test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per 45 days thereafter.  Results are then reviewed by medical personnel and compared to pre-flight OOHA data and also to previous on-orbit OOHA results.  Note: There have been temporary shifts in hearing sensitivity documented on some crewmembers, most of which have recovered to pre-mission levels.] Sunita performed the periodic calibration check on the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer).  After the following periodic change-out of the TOCA WWB (Waste Water Bag), FE-5 conducted the regular (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA, after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.        [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.] Aki, who will perform the EVA-18 spacewalk with Suni, worked on the EVA Systems hardcopy book to strike through procedures which will be used electronically for EVA 18 only.     [EVA-18 objectives are: Connect & route two power cables for the yet-to-arrive Russian MLM (Multipurpose Laboratory Module) between the FGB and US Segment (future Russian EVA will complete the cable layouts and provide US power to MLM & SM via all 4 MBSUs [Main Bus Switching Units], instead of current configuration where only two are used to power SM), remove the failed MBSU1 and replace it with the spare MBSU, install failed MBSU1 in stbd ESP-1 FSE (External Stowage Platform 1 Flight Support Equipment), remove failed SSRMS Boom B CLPA (Camera, Light, Pan/Tilt Assembly) and replace with spare CLPA.  Get-aheads (time permitting): Install PMA-2 MMOD/thermal cover, remove & replace MBS (Mobile Base System) mast CLPA, replace JEF VE (JEM Exposed Facility Vision Equipment) fwd camera+light, clear FOD (foreign object debris) from FGB PDGF (Power & Data Grapple Fixture), and reconfigure EVA tools (WIF/Worksite Interface Fixture Extender).] Acaba & Malenchenko conducted a one-hour review of the update SSRMS/Robotics tasks for EVA-18 and the associated POC DOUG (Portable Onboard Computer Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) display. FE-3 & FE-5 had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.] The three Russian crewmembers had several hours set aside for the standard “symbolic” activities with commemorative items, such as signing & stamping envelopes.  Joe, Aki & Suni participated where desired.     [The Soyuz- and Progress-delivered “Symbolic” kits contained 60 Roskosmos envelopes, 60 Simvolika P envelopes with the Exp-32 mission logo, a Roskosmos flag, and 12 Rosaviation & Russian Air Force flags.]  CDR, FE-2 & FE-4 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- & Ku-band audio/video, Gennady at ~12:40pm, Sergei at ~1:55pm, Yuri at ~2:30pm EDT. At 8:40am, the six crewmembers conducted their weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office/CB (Peggy Whitson), via S-band S/G-2 audio & phone patch. Before Presleep, Acaba turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] At ~10:05 am, the three USOS crewmembers, Acaba, Hoshide & Williams, joined up for another 45-min EVA-18 procedures review & discussion with MCC-H spacewalk specialists. At ~11:05am, Suni Williams supported a PAO TV event, downlinking her responses to questions from students at Wickliffe School, Upper Arlington, OH. The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [FE-6 & FE-5 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Suni & Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Suni’s protocol for today had T2 (30sec, int.), with ARED (video)/CEVIS, EVA-18, and T2 (4 min, int.) for the next 3 days.  Aki’s protocol showed ARED/CEVIS for today, with T2 (4 min, int.) and EVA-18 on the following 2 days.] Before exercising on the ARED, Hoshide set up and checked out the G1 video camera for it to record his workout session on the machine, meeting the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.  Afterwards, Aki stowed the video footage. Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko & Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), andA ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.
