ISS On-Orbit Status 03/31/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday. ATV-3 Power Status: ATV-3 power has been successfully reintegrated with ISS power.・        The lights are on in ATV but the outlets remain unpowered.  The plan is to move forward with the reboost this afternoon.  ・        Yesterday, power feed from the ISS SM (Service Module) to ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) was lost when RECS (Russian Equipment Control System) power channel 1 in the DRS (Docking & Refueling System) Rack located in the ATV failed.  RECS channel 2 was activated, and its integration into the ISS power grid was successfully attempted today at ~12:00pm EDT, taking about an hour.・        The POTOK air purifier is disconnected from SM power since DRS/RECS failure analysis by ATV-CC (Control Center)/Toulouse has not yet excluded it as a possible cause.  Until then, if POTOK is connected to SM power, ATV will be electrically isolated from SM power. ・        The crew has almost completed the high-priority cargo transfers started this morning at ~6:00am EDT.  They will complete those operations today.  Later, the status of cargo transfer will be discussed so that the IMS (Inventory Management System) can be updated by the ground.  No further transfer operations will be conducted today, and some planned activities were deferred.  After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.   Ivanishin conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Later, Ivanishin inspected the cultures taken with the ECOSFERA equipment for Stage 1 of the microbial air sampling run for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment on 3/29 from ATV cabin surfaces, logging the results.  The Petri dishes with the cultures had been stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container at +37 deg for incubation.      [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge, the sample collection was being performed in two stages.] FE-5 André Kuipers conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection & maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 & O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes. André also closed the protective external shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola & JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) window to prevent their contamination from thruster effluents during and after tonight’s ATV3 test reboost (5:54pm EDT). With warmer times approaching in Kazakhstan, Shkaplerov & Kononenko relocated the standard Russian TZK-14 Thermal Protection Jackets (three each) from the Soyuz TMA-03M/29S and Soyuz TMA-22/28S spacecraft to ISS stowage.        [These warm coats, always ready for an emergency return in cold climate, are required to protect the crew after a landing Kazakhstan (or Russia) in winter time.]  Pettit & Kuipers filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Don’s 12th, André’s 11th.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces & spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] FE-1 & FE-5 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Anton at ~8:00am, André at ~10:35am EDT. At ~8:35am, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~9:05am, Burbank conducted the weekly phone conference with the PLUTO (Plug-In Port Utilization Officer) flight control team at MCC-Houston. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).       [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.]  Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko & Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �CA ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on the volcanoes Popocatepetl, Huascaran, Cordon-Kaul & Hudson, and the glaciers of Patagonia;A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Western Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, andMore preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb). ISS/ATV Test Reboost:   Tonight at 5:54pm EDT, a one-burn ISS test reboost with ATV3 “Edoardo Amaldi” OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters will be conducted for a duration of 6 min 51 sec (351 sec) and a delta-V of 1.0 m/s.  Attitude control authority will be handed over to Russian MCS (Motion Control System) thrusters at ~4:25pm, followed by ISS transition to reboost mode at ~4:54pm.  Attitude control authority returns to US CMG momentum management at ~6:40pm.  Purpose of the reboost is to test the ATV OCS thrusters as well as set up phasing for 28S landing on 4/27.

BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids, NASA):   On 3/26, in anticipation of BASS operations, soot accumulation was removed from the hardware in order to improve the flow through the duct, and the reconfiguration of the hardware from SLICE to BASS was completed.  Finally, fan calibrations were performed with zero, one, and two fan flow constrictors in place.  The fan calibrations demonstrated that the flow was indeed greatly improved.  On 3/30, the three initial BASS samples were successfully ignited.  These tests were intended to dial-in our camera settings, so bracketed digital still images were taken throughout.   1. The first sample was a flat SIBAL fabric sample (50% cotton/50% fiberglass).  Ignition was achieved within one second after igniter was powered, and a very stable symmetric flame was obtained.  The flow was at 10 cm/s, and the flame reached a steady state in about 15 seconds.  The total burn time was 40 seconds.   2. The second test burned a 2-cm diameter PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) sphere.  Ignition was achieved after about 20 seconds.  A stable blue flame was formed, which spread into a yellow flame encompassing the entire sphere.  Vapor jetting from the fuel was observed as small air bubbles in the PMMA reached the surface and burst.  Several different flow velocities were set and images at each setting were achieved.  After 2 minutes of burning, the flow was turned off and the flame extinguished rapidly.   3. The third and final sample burned was a 1-cm diameter PMMA sphere.  Ignition was reached within 10 seconds.  The initial blue flame rapidly transitioned into a yellow flame encompassing the entire sphere, even when the airflow was reduced from 10cm/s to 3 cm/s.  After about a minute of burning, the nitrogen was turned on, and the flame responded but did not go out.  In fact the flame appeared to get brighter.  This is a dramatic demonstration of how an improperly-located gas suppression system can actually enhance the flame by entraining air.  Furthermore and importantly, the flame persisted when the flow was off but the nitrogen was on.  The nitrogen jet was able to entrain air all by itself.  Future tests with the spheres will likely examine very low-speed flows (less than 5 cm/s) and the spheres will be moved closer to the nitrogen nozzle to enable extinguishment via nitrogen.  Thanks to Don for a very successful first day of operation! BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 6):   No report.      [Colloids are particles as small as a few tens of nanometers (a thousandth of a thousandth of a millimeter) that are suspended in a medium, usually a liquid or a gas. The name “colloid” comes from the Greek word for “glue”, and expresses very important properties of colloids: when small and light enough, particles can be influenced in their behavior by forces of electromagnetic origin, and make them stick together, or repel each other depending on the configuration. Colloids are widely studied in science because the forces between particles can be controlled and tuned and because particles, while being small enough to be influenced by such forces, are big and slow enough to be seen with a relatively simple and inexpensive laboratory instrument like a microscope. This is why colloids are often studied as model for molecular systems (like standard gases or liquids) where molecules, the individual constituents, are much smaller than colloids and cannot be seen with light. As mentioned, forces between colloids can be tuned giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena. One of them is aggregation, which is when particles stick together and tend to form structures. Among the many ways to induce particle aggregation, one allows to do so by controlling the temperature of the solution in which the particles are immersed, thanks to very weak forces called “critical Casimir forces” that have been predicted more than 30 years ago but just partially verified in experiments. The objective of SODI COLLOID is to measure such forces and produce a controlled aggregation of tiny plastic particles. This would allow to shed light on critical Casimir forces and to make a step towards the fabrication of new nanostructured materials with remarkable optical properties for industrial applications.] BIOLAB (ESA):     Thanks, Don, for a very swift performance of the BIOLAB oxygen sensor demating activity!
