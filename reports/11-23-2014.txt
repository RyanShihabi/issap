41 Soyuz (41S) Launch and Dock:  41S launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 3:01pm CST today with Shkaplerov, Cristoforetti, and Virts onboard. After orbital insertion, the vehicle deployed its antennas and solar arrays nominally then proceeded with a 4-orbit rendezvous with ISS.  Docking to the MRM-1 module occurred at 8:49 PM CST with hatch opening subsequently taking place at 11:03 PM CST. Today’s succesful docking, increased the ISS crew compliment from 3 to 6 crewmembers.
Sound Level Meter (SLM) Operations:  Wilmore performed this routine activity to measure the acoustic environment in the habitable areas of the ISS. The data collected will be downlinked and reviewed by specialists to determine if any mitigation steps are required for the various modules.
