ISS On-Orbit Status 09/24/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off duty. FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection. CDR Fossum serviced the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) experiment, checking camera operations during the day and changing the camera battery in the morning and before sleeptime (change required after 8 hrs).       [The new experiment run is with a Harvard University phase separation sample using a different setup than for the recent crystal samples 9 & 10, mainly requiring an SSC laptop with EarthKAM timing software, power cables and camera USB cable.  For illumination, the Mini-MagLite and Flash batteries do not need to be changed yet, but the camera will need a freshly charged battery.  After Mike started the run by mixing the sample (#4) for phase separation and taking test photos, the EarthKAM software on the SSC-13 laptop began taking pictures of Sample 4 for 13 days at different intervals throughout the run.  This requires camera battery changes twice a day and image check with a battery change once per day.  BCAT-5 is operating in the JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) because some time ago the crew deemed the US Lab too crowded for running it.] In the SM, Volkov supported the ongoing tests of the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) by copying the test data collected overnight from the RSE-SLS A31p laptop to the RSS2 laptop for data downlink. Fossum, Volkov & Furukawa joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, FE-4 completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. Afterwards, Volkov inspected the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and verified proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules.       [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] Sergei also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.  This included the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time & “On” durations for calldown.      [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers]. In Node-2, FE-5 Furukawa used the vacuum cleaner on the vents of the OpsLAN Servers LS1 & ISS-SERVER1 in bay O3, to ensure optimal performance. The CDR turned on MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) routing and started data flow, downlinking CFE results from 9/15 and the video of the Robonaut EPO (Educational Payload Operation) from 9/22, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).    After the overnight ground-commanded payload operations on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), Mike Fossum installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the rack in the Lab at S3 to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances) over the weekend. Mike also reconfigured the WHC (Waste & Hygiene Compartment) from feeding the internal EDV-U container to supplying the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) directly for processing.        [After yesterday’s R&R (remove & replace) of the failed FCPA (Fluids Control & Pump Assembly), the ground was not able to reactivate the UPA, and it remains in shutdown over the weekend.  The current thinking is that the problem is due to an override issue rather than a connection or other hardware issue.  Usually when the UPA is deactivated, the WHC is configured to use an internal EDV.  However, to conserve EDVs, Mike today temporarily integrated the WHC with the UPA.] Servicing the MSL (Materials Science Laboratory), Fossum performed Sample Exchange-2 #2 in the SQF (Solidification & Quenching Furnace), removing a used SCA (Sample Cartridge Assembly) and replacing it with the next test sample (SETA 23).   Due to spatial constraints, the nearby CEVIS exercise device, with seat moved back, could not be used during the MSSR (Material Science Research Rack 1) activity, which was video-monitored from the ground via MPC.      [The ESA/NASA MSRR-1 provides a powerful multi-user MSL with diverse EMs (Experiment Modules) so that many material types, such as metals, alloys, polymers, semiconductors, ceramics, crystals, and glasses, can be studied in micro-G to discover new applications for existing materials and new or improved materials.  MSRR experiments are coordinated by international teams that share different parts of the samples.] Satoshi prepared JAXA EPO (Educational Program Operation) Report Nr. 10, i.e., writing another short report showing ordinary life in space which, it is expected, will attract children and the general public's attention for future human space exploration.       [JAXA EPO Report 10 is intended for THE MAINICHI newspapers, with the topic “On the Crew Medical Officer".] At ~8:35am EDT, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. At ~10:05am, Sergei had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop). At ~11:35am, Sergei, Satoshi & Mike joined for a Russian PAO TV downlink, transmitting TV messages of greetings to two events,- (1) the graduates of the Ministry of Defense Institutions of Higher Learning on 10/1 at the Krasnoznamensk Officers’ Club Auditorium, to honor the graduates who have come to the G. S. Titov Main Test Center to continue their military service, and (2) the participants of the XXII Assembly of the International Black Sea Club, to be held 10/2 in Azov, addressing issues associated with the implementation of space activity results by the Black Sea nations.  The members of the International Black Sea Club are municipal organizations from Bulgaria, Greece, Russia, Romania, and Ukraine. Tasks listed for Sergei Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Another ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,  The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).

The video and still images from both the CCF and MSG cameras are much improved!  For the remainder of this week, we continued running both subcritical and critical flow test points.  The basic science of CCF is to look at flow in a wedge-shaped channel (the blue colored chamber in the video).  The purpose of these tests is to measure the flow limits in this geometry, i.e. there is some maximum flow rate in the channel at which the free surface (or gas/liquid interface) will "collapse" and gas bubbles are ingested in the liquid flow in the channel.  These are also referred to as critical flow points.  In addition, at flow rates below these critical points, there are a number of interesting phenomena, such as oscillations of the free surface that we are interested in capturing.  We'll try to get you some video or still images of this type of data in the next week or so.” CFE-2 (Capillary Flow Experiment 2, NASA):      No report.

Please don't hesitate to contact us or provide feedback if there is anything we can do to assist you to achieve success with our payload.  Through 9/20 we have already received 1,840 of your CEO frames for review and cataloging.  We are pleased to report your acquisition of imagery this week with times corresponding to those of our CEO Daily Target Lists for the following targets:  Monaco, Monaco - these frames were acquired in an automated session and unfortunately there were more clouds than we anticipate - we will continue to request this target;  Rome, Italy - these were also in an automated session and only a couple of these offered even context views of this target;  and Volga - Ural Delta - you did acquire frames with partial coverage of the Volga Delta only - these are still under cataloging and review for content meeting our target requirements.  In our backlog of reviewing increment 28-29 imagery we are also pleased to report your acquisition of useful imagery meeting our site requirements for Baghdad, Iraq - this site can be removed from our list now.  Better still you successfully acquired our first-ever Astronaut photography of the Bigach Impact Crater, Kazakhstan.  This imagery will prove invaluable for helping crews locate this feature for more detailed views in the future - kudos to the crew for acquiring this very challenging target.  Within the same photo session for Bigach, was your beautiful view of sand dunes in the Junggar Basin of Northwestern China that was published on the NASA/GSFC's Earth Observatory website this past weekend.  The illumination within this view nicely illustrates a complex landscape where the erosional forces of both wind and water are at work in a desert setting.  Nice shot!” CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Munich, Germany (by ESA request for this capital city in the state of Bavaria.  Looking slightly left of track towards the center of the oldest part of this city of 1.4 million), Sofia, Bulgaria (the Bulgarian capital city of Sofia is located in the western part of the country within in a broad valley of the Balkan Mountains.  ISS had a nadir pass in late morning with fair weather and approach from the WNW.  As ISS tracked SE over the Balkan Peninsula, the crew was to look for this metropolitan area of nearly 2 million.  CEO was seeking a context view that includes the entire city), Khartoum, Sudan (Khartoum is the capital and largest city of Sudan, with a population of over five million.  As ISS tracked SE, the crew was to look left of track at the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers.  The dark lines of the rivers in the light-toned desert landscape are their visual cues.  Shooting for context views to capture the entire city at the joining of these two rivers), and Hurricane Hilary (DYNAMIC EVENT: Hurricane Hilary became the eastern Pacific’s 8th named tropical cyclone this season early on 9/21.  Since that time, it has rapidly strengthened to a Category 4 storm with maximum winds of 125kts as it moved west at 8kts on 9/23.  As ISS tracked southeastward, the crew was to look obliquely left of track for this hurricane.  By then, Hilary is forecasted to continue moving west and to maintain Category 4 strength, but possibly weakening to a strong Category 3 storm.  Trying for either broad views of the storm as a whole or, if an eye is still visible, trying for detailed views of its structure).
