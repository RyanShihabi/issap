ISS On-Orbit Status 06/21/12 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    It’s Summer! Happy Birthday, Gennady!           Happy Birthday, Oleg! After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. FE-1 Padalka terminated his 2nd experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]  Oleg Kononenko spent most of his working hours in the SM, supporting the ground in testing the SEP (Electric Power System) Channel B Power Controller begun last December by Anton Shkaplerov, using UKR-50 equipment to test connections at the four Russian SNT-50MP power converter boxes under the TVIS treadmill and the BSK-7,5 power-switching device (blok silovoiy kommutatsii).       [This is an investigation of the as-yet unresolved uncommanded triggering of the SEPV telemetry parameter (which deactivates the SEP Power Controller on channel B).  Indications are right now that the problem is with SNT-1.] To enable the IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the SEP Power Controller hardware under the SM “floor”, the TVIS treadmill was removed once more from its temporary stowage in the “pit” by Padalka & Revin.  Later in the day, after the SEP activities, TVIS was again temporarily stowed in its regular place. Also in support of the SEP work, the CDR actuated the P-16 CO2 absorbent cartridge (PP) in the SM (behind panel 417), readied yesterday by him, and then powered down the Vozdukh CO2 scrubber.  After the SEP troubleshooting, Kononenko re-activated Vozdukh and turned off the PP. Sergei Revin conducted the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit.     [The AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO2 during the regeneration of the PP absorbent cartridges.] In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-3 Acaba continued servicing the ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System), finishing the OPA (O-Phthalaldehyde) replenishment of the LTL (Low Temperature Loop) via the AmiA (Anti-Microbial Applicator) and completing the servicing with the 2nd coolant refill.      [Steps included removal of the AmiA insulation blanket to allow temperature equalization (which will take at least 24 hrs before AmiA can be removed), then the second refill of the loop with coolant from the FSS (Fluid Servicer System), with draining and purging of the FSS FCPA (Fluid Control & Pump Assembly) and jumpers for storage, and finally storage of the PWR (Payload Water Reservoirs) used.] FE-6 Pettit performed his 5th and last (R-15) ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Resting Echo Scan in the US Lab, assisted by Joe Acaba who served as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) to operate the USND (Ultrasound) scans.       [Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable & VOX, Don underwent the USND scan for ICV assessment, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera.  Heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor).  There are dietary constraints, and no exercise is allowed 4 hrs prior to scan.  After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed.  Later, the data from the two HM-2 (Holter Monitor 2) HiFi Cards and two Actiwatch Spectrums were transferred from the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) hard drive to the USND-2 USB drive.  Voice required last 5 minutes for crew to inform ground copy process is complete.  The USND echo experiment uses the Image Collector software on the laptop and requires VOX/Voice plus RT Video downlink during the activity.  Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).] Subsequently, Don Pettit also performed his 4th in-flight ESA Vessel Imaging (Echography) ultrasound scans in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), assisted by Joe as Operator, using the Image Collector software on the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop, with VOX/Voice plus real-time video downlink during the activity.    [Vascular Echography (Vessel Imaging) evaluates the changes in central and peripheral blood vessel wall properties (thickness and compliance) and cross sectional areas of long-duration ISS crewmembers during and after long-term exposure to microgravity.  An LBNP (Lower Body Negative Pressure) program will be run in parallel to Vessel Imaging.  Flow velocity changes in the aorta and the middle cerebral and femoral arteries will be used to quantify the cardiovascular response to fluid shift.  Vessel Imaging aims to optimize the countermeasures used routinely during long-duration space missions.] With the G1 camcorder configured to provide live “over-the-shoulder” viewing in the Kibo JPM, André Kuipers finished setting up the FPEF MS (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility / Marangoni Surface) payload for upcoming Marangoni experimentation.       [Steps today included installing the experiment cover body into the FPEF, connecting the payload bus cable and the 1553B IPU (Image Processing Unit) user video cable between IPU and FPEF, installing the FPEF silicone hose and closing out the Marangoni MWA I/Fs (Maintenance Work Area Interfaces B & A).     Background:  In microgravity, fluids react differently to stresses when compared to the same stresses on Earth.  Understanding the responses to the stressors allows for improved fluid flow models to be designed.  Mass transfer on or in a liquid due to surface tension differences is called the Marangoni Effect (which, for example, stabilizes a soap film).  The Marangoni convection experiments in the FPEF examine fluid tension flow in micro-G:  first, a liquid bridge of silicone oil is formed into a pair of disks.  Then, using temperature differences imposed on the disks, convection is induced causing the silicone oil to move and transition through different types of flows because of its fluid instability: successively from laminar to oscillatory, chaos, and turbulence flows as the driving force increases.  The flow and temperature fields are observed in each stage and the transition conditions and processes are investigated.] In COL, Kuipers next set up and activated the HD-VCA2 (High Definition Video Camera Assembly), ensuring that the GPS (Global Positioning System) LAPAP (laptop application) on the PWS1 (Portable Workstation 1) was within view and legible. Afterwards, André performed a test, deferred yesterday, on the three pressure relief valves of the EMCS (European Modular Cultivation System), on its holding structure, by pushing a button on each of them for about 5-10 sec to make sure that the pressure or resistance is low. Gennady & Sergei undertook the periodic (generally monthly) health test with the cardiological experiment PZEh MO-1 (“Study of the Bioelectric Activity of the Heart at Rest”) on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation & Stabilization), their first.       [Equipment used was VPG/Temporal Pulsogram and 8-channel ECG/Electrocardiogram Data Output Devices (USI).  The test took place during an RGS (Russian Groundsite) overflight window (~4:56am EDT) via VHF for data downlink from the VPG and Gamma-1M ECG for about 5-6 minutes.  MO-1 is scheduled 30±3 days after launch and 1-2 days before or after PHS (Periodic Health Status), always before exercise.] Padalka also completed his 2nd session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.      [Kononenko stood by to assist FE-1 in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit, and Sergei took documentary photography.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.] Acaba completed another weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery & Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (31-0005G) lists 15 CWCs (282.6 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (5 CWCs with 211.9 L);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (4 CWCs with 56.7 L); and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] Don Pettit performed routine maintenance on the WRS (Water Recovery System) in Node-3, manually transferring urine from an EDV-U container (#969) to the UPA WSTA (Urine Processor Assembly / Waste Storage Tank Assembly) for UPA processing.  Desired offload quantity: 70%.        [During such transfers, the crewmember always wears protective safety goggles, dust mask and nitrile gloves.] In the Kibo laboratory, Pettit serviced the JPM PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop, checking out its battery and replacing it with a new battery if it was found failed. Afterwards, Don conducted the visual T+2 days (44 ± 4h) microbial (bacterial & fungal) analysis of water samples collected by André on 6/19 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Hot port (125 mL) using the WMK MCD (Water Microbiology Kit / Microbial Capture Devices) for microbial traces, and the CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for inflight coliform indications (Magenta for Positive, Yellow for Negative). FE-6 also had ~80 min for dismantling and restowing the hardware used by him yesterday for the Amine Swingbed installation.         [Installation and subsequent leak checks were successful.  The Swingbed will be activated on 6/23 (Saturday) by ground controllers, to begin a series of runs over three days, concluding on 6/25 (Monday).] Padalka worked with the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for CO (Carbon Monoxide), Formaldehyde and Ammonia contamination in the SM, recording the measurements.      [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C8H10), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur Dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, Ozone, Acetic Acid, Ammonia, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrous Oxides, Acetone, Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, etc.] Gennady then took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] Later, FE-1 also performed standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in the MRM1 Rassvet, downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.] With its battery freshly charged yesterday, Sergei Revin installed the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9, using it to take spectral and photographic imagery of Earth’s suface and atmosphere (9:35am-9:45am EDT) under ground commanding.  Later, FE-2 dismantled the equipment for stowage and dumped the data from Laptop 3 via the RSS1 terminal.        [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.] Afterwards, Sergei prepared the Russian Glovebox-S in the MRM1 Rassvet module for operation with the BTKh-26 KASKAD (Cascade) biotechnology payload, inserted the bioreactor in its KT thermal enclosure in the SM PrK (Transfer Tunnel) and set up the TBU-V (Universal Bioengineering Thermostat V) incubator at +29 degC for the ground-controlled research experiment.  The setup was then documented with the NIKON D2X digital camera. Don completed a software reload on SSC-17 (Station Support Computer 17) in two parts, deferred from yesterday.     [First part – with the laptop connected to the OpsLAN via ISL Ethernet cable, second part – reconfigured for wireless operation and relocated back to the Node-3/Cupola after the ground-controlled reload from an Admin PC.] André conducted a photographic survey of the current cargo stowage situation in the COL cabin, estimated to require about 30 pictures for the overall cabin and Starboard endcone space.      [Photos were to depict each COL rack front and each Stbd endcone quadrant, plus all SUPs (Standard Utility Panels).] FE-3 Acaba undertook the monthly inspection of the T2/COLBERT treadmill system and its components, checking pin alignment, rack centering and the snubber jam nut witness marks.     [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- & Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm.  Their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.] FE-5 Kuipers unstowed the Pro K pH kit and prepositioned it with controlled diet menu items and daily consumables in preparation for his upcoming 5th Pro K Controlled Diet activity, starting tomorrow with the first pH test and diet log entry.       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet & urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.] FE-5 also had another hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers. At ~2:35am EDT, Kononenko, Padalka & Revin conducted a Russian PAO TV event, communicating via Telebridge video link with the Russian sailing training ship “Nadezhda”, currently stationed in Yeosu, Republic of Korea, and conversing with VIP persons and media on the subject of APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) in 2012 and its particular interest on development and preservation of World Ocean resources.    [One of the largest platforms for discussing World Ocean security is the trade show EXPO-2012, currently taking place in South Korea.  Results of today’s video link will become a substantial contribution to Russia’s proposals for a special declaration to closely manage fragile World Ocean ecosystems for their enrichment.] At ~6:55am, André conducted the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with the EAC (European Astronaut Center) near Cologne /Germany. Before Presleep, Pettit will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).  No exercise reported today for CDR.      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval & continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]  BCC Update:   The BCC (Backup Control Center) testing with Huntsville was successfully completed last night. The test was conducted with all the IPs (International Partners) except Moscow due to some coordination issues. The test with Moscow will be rescheduled.  CDRA Update:   Since the Lab Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly temperature sensor C maintenance last week, the sensor still has exhibited erratic temperature data.  During crew sleep a temperature spike took the Lab CDRA down.  After crew wake, three recovery actions were attempted without success.  The Node-3 CDRA was brought up and is running at this time.  As will be remembered, Node-3 CDRA has an issue with ASVs (Air Selector Valves) sticking on occasion.  The Node-3 CDRA is currently performing acceptably.  If it were to fail due to the ASV sticking, there are procedures in place to recover the Node-3 CDRA manually while the Lab CDRA issues are worked.  The Ops Team is working with the Engineering Teams on the software update that will allow the Lab CDRA to work without the temperature sensors.  Looking for a time for the crew to remove the last temperature sensor on the Lab CDRA.  RRM Update:   The first of three days of RRM (Robotic Refueling Mission) operations came to a successful conclusion last night with NASA & CSA (Canadian Space Agency) ground teams completing all scheduled satellite-servicing tasks using the NASA RRM module and the Canadian SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) robot.  Remotely controlled from the ground by mission operators at NASA JSC, SPDM “Dextre” used the RRM MFT (Multifunction Tool) to remove and stow a T-valve on the RRM module, the first of four main tasks scheduled for this set of operations.  The MFT, developed at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), is in position to demonstrate the next two satellite-servicing tasks on the RRM module: removing and stowing an ambient cap, and manipulating a plug located under the ambient cap.  Today, NASA & CSA teams also successfully completed all scheduled satellite-servicing tasks, with SPDM using the RRM MFT and its connected ACA (Ambient Cap Adapter) to remove and stow an ambient cap on the RRM module.  The module and Dextre are in position for their last current tasks, to manipulate a plug located under the ambient cap and begin preparations for the refueling demonstration in late summer 2012.  RRM operations demonstrate the tools, technologies, and techniques needed to robotically repair and refuel satellites on orbit, especially those not designed to be serviced.CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Lake Nasser, Toshka Lakes, Egypt (ISS had an early afternoon pass in clear weather with a pass offering nadir views of this target.  The Toshka Lakes formed in the late 1990's when record high water in the Nile River and Lake Nasser spilled out into desert depressions to the west.  Since then the lakes have persisted, but continue to slowly dry up.  Lake Nasser is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world, holding an enormous 157 cubic kilometers of water, with a shoreline length of 7844 km.  At this time, as ISS tracked northeastward to the east of the Nile, the crew was to look nadir for context views of the area), Athens, Greece (Capital Cities Collection: The capital of Greece is an ancient city that dominates the south coast of the region known as Attica in the southeastern part of the mainland.  ISS had a late afternoon pass in clear weather over this sprawling urban area of more than 3 million.  As ISS approached the coast from the SW, the crew was to aim left of track for this target), San Marino, San Marino (Capital Cities Collection: ISS had a nadir pass over this tiny capital city of this microstate.  Trying for a mapping strip to acquire useful views.  The Republic itself is land-locked and is located about 20 miles southwest of the Italian coastal city of Rimini.  Best visual cues are Rimini's small but prominent bay and a light-toned river which reaches the sea at this point), Ljubljana, Slovenia (Capital Cities Collection: ISS had an early evening pass over the capital city of Slovenia with clear weather expected. Ljubljana is located in the center of the country in the Ljubljana Basin and has a population of about 272,000 people.  As the crew tracked over the Adriatic Sea and towards south-central Europe, they were to shoot left of track to capture context views of this capital city), and Zagreb, Croatia (Capital Cities Collection: The Croatian capital city is located in the NW of the country and lies in the valley of the Sava River on the southern slopes of Medvednica Mountain.  ISS had a fair weather pass in early evening light with approach from the WSW.  At this time, the crew was to look nadir for this target for a context view of the entire city in a single frame.
