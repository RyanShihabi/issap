New Status: 
Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) Proximity Communication Equipment (PCE) Installation:  FE-2 Misurkin installed and successfully checked out the PCE equipment required for ATV4 docking.  A successful checkout of the РСЕ and Antenna Switching Controller (БУАП) in the Service Module is needed prior to the ground fueling the ATV4 tanks, which is scheduled to launch on June 5, 2013.
Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS): FE-3 Cassidy set up for operations and conducted the ninth of thirteen sessions planned for this experiment. BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity and will guide strategies for extinguishing fires in microgravity. BASS results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth.
Seedling Growth:  Cassidy changed out an Experiment Container (EC) for the Seedling Growth experiment today, inserting the old EC into the Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) and replacing it with a new EC into the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) facility.  Seedling Growth studies the effects of microgravity on the growth of plants and is being performed in collaboration with the European Space Agency. Images of the plants will be captured and down-linked to Earth. Samples of the plants will be harvested and returned to Earth for scientific analysis. The results of this experiment can lead to information that will aid researchers in food production studies concerning future long-duration space missions, as well as data that will enhance crop production on Earth.
Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Operations: Thursday, Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the SSRMS and walked off from Mobile Remote Servicer (MRS) Base System (MBS) Power and Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF) 1 to MBS PDGF 3 in preparation for upcoming Cargo Transportation Container (CTC) stow operations early next month. After a base change to LEE B was successfully completed, PDGF 1 was released and the SSRMS was backed off to a clearance position.
Treadmill (T2) software loss of connection to hardware – While a crew member was exercising on T2 today, the software lost connection to the Command Logic Unit (CLU) in the T2.  Several troubleshooting options were tried with no success.  After the system was power-cycled, connection was restored.  T2 is available for nominal operations.
2B Photo Voltaic Thermal Control System (PVTCS) pump B checkout – Pumps A and B were switched over briefly to verify functionality of Pump B.  Pump B performed nominally, and the loop was switched back to Pump A as the nominal configuration.  The deadhead Fault Detection Isolation Response (FDIR) was re-enabled.

Previous Status (05/13/10):
Binary Colloidal Alloy Test (BCAT)-4: Cassidy configured and deployed the BCAT-4 sample module.  The BCAT-4 module is being revisited after being undisturbed for several years to see the condition of the sample and their mixing status.  BCAT-4 is an experiment of two samples containing microscopic spheres suspended in a liquid which are designed to determine how crystals can form from the samples after they have been well mixed. The two samples have the same average sphere size but one of them has a wider range (more polydisperse) of sizes in order to demonstrate the dependence of crystallization on particle size range. Results from these experiments help scientists develop fundamental physics concepts which will enable the development of a wide range of next generation technologies (such as in high speed computers and advanced optical devices).
Station Support Computer (SSC) Ultra Bay Hard Drive Installation: Cassidy installed additional hard drives on the crew assigned SSCs.  These additional hard drives will be used to backup crew personal data in advance of a software patch and ensure that there is enough data storage space for the upcoming 35 Soyuz crew.
Seedling Growth On-Board Training (OBT): In advance of the upcoming Seedling Growth activities, Cassidy reviewed OBT materials and the procedures that will execute during the remainder of the increment.  Seedling Growth studies the effects of microgravity on the growth of plants and is being performed on board the International Space Station (ISS) in collaboration with the European Space Agency. Images of the plants will be captured and down-linked to Earth. Samples of the plants will be harvested and returned to Earth for scientific analysis. The results of this experiment can lead to information that will aid researchers in food production studies concerning future long-duration space missions, as well as data that will enhance crop production on Earth.
