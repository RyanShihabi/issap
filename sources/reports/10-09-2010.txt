ISS On-Orbit Status 10/09/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday –  Soyuz 24S Docking Day.
 
 Sleep cycle shift:  To accommodate tonight’s arrival of Soyuz TMA-01M/24S at ~8:02pm EDT, crew wake/sleep cycle changes are in effect, featuring a two-part Saturday workday:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Wake      –  2:00am EDT (this morning)</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Lunch – 9:00am</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Sleep –       10:00am-2:00pm </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Wake –       2:00pm</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Sleep –       4:30am  (tomorrow, Sunday 10/10) for a very long “sleep” </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">(CDR to get up at      briefly 1:30pm-1:50pm for transfer of PADIAC EC2 from KUBIK-3 to BLB      TCU-2)</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Wake      –  2:00am (Monday 10/11) – returning to nominal.</li> </ul> 
  At wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  After wakeup, CDR Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker performed a session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  Doug &amp; Shannon completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  At the COL EDR (Columbus Orbital Laboratory European Drawer Rack) the CDR unstowed the KUBIK-3 thermostat-controlled container, setting it up in preparation of the ESA/Swiss experiment PADIAC (Pathway Different Activators), then turned on the EDR laptop and started preheating in two KUBIKs to +37 degC.      [KUBIK-3 (stand-alone) to be used for the short &amp; KUBIK-6 (in EDR) for the long PADIAC run.  PADIAC will study activation of T-cells (mature white blood cells from the thymus gland) in microgravity to improve the knowledge of the immune system.]
 
  On TsUP Go, Fyodor repressurized the ISS cabin atmosphere with O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) from Progress 37P’s SKDS Section 2 tankage. 
 
  Walker completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router &amp; FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops (the latter required to mitigate the problem of iPV and OSTPV not opening up procedures due to a memory leak in the “Tomcat” software).  After a period of no less than 10 min later, FE-6 also rebooted the two ISS network servers (SERVER1 &amp; 2).
 
  Shannon also conducted the periodic camera setup status check on the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) with Sample 7, done one, three and five days after initializing.
 
  In the SM (Service Module), Fyodor Yurchikhin did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  In line with today’s shortened Part 1 duty cycle, the crew performed an abbreviated physical workout regime on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), and VELO (ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).    [TVIS was approved for exercising yesterday after the replacement of its VIS (Vibration Isolation System) Controller restored it to full serve.]
 
  At ~8:25am EDT, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  After their regular midday lunch break at ~9:00am, the three crewmembers began their first sleep period at ~10:00am.
 
  With a new “day” beginning at 2:00pm, Wheelock &amp; Walker performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.
 
  Meanwhile, Yurchikhin started the 2<sup>nd</sup> wake period with the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V), to be repeated tomorrow morning at ~2:00am before next bedtime.
 
  CDR &amp; FE-6 will work out on the exercise equipment, Wheels 1h on the CEVIS, Shannon 1.5h on ARED.
 
  For tonight’s Soyuz arrival, Walker is scheduled to –
