ISS On-Orbit Status 05/23/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – light-duty day for the ISS crew (soon to double in size!).
 
  FE-1 Barratt continued his second run of sleep logging for the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a week-long session.  This is similar to Barratt’s BCD (Baseline Data Collection) which was performed pre-flight for comparison.    [To monitor the crewmember’s sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, Mike wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as his patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and uses the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  The crew performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the FE's sleep station with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the house cleaning, CDR Padalka conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning on fan screens in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and SM (VPkhO, VPrK, FS5, FS6 &amp; FS9), plus dust filter replacement in the FGB.
 
  The CDR also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  For his chosen VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) program, FE-2 Wakata worked in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), installing dehumidifier units in the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) incubator’s micro-G &amp; 1-G sections.
 
  FE-1 Barratt’s VolSci choice, troubleshooting the nonfunctional AgCam (Agricultural Camera), was to look into two failure possibilities identified on the ground team’s fault tree: (1) Bent or broken pins on the AgCam data acquisition cable (straighten pins if bent, wait for a new cable if broken), or (2) failed parallel port on the AgCam laptop (if so, swap with ELT-3 {EXPRESS-3 Rack laptop}).  Further steps depend on the outcome of the troubleshooting. 
 
  In the US Airlock, Wakata wrapped up the BC4 (Battery Charger 4) troubleshooting by terminating the test discharge of EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) battery #2037 in BC4.
 
  Koichi also completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and File Server SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops.
 
  At ~9:00am EDT, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  At ~11:55am, Gennady Padalka powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at ~12:00pm conducted a ham radio session with the participants of the Second Russian Innovation Forum at Kursk.
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the TVIS treadmill (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2) and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).    [The CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) continues to be unusable (see above).]
 
  Afterwards, Mike downloaded the exercise data file to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlinking, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  CDR Padalka had four job items on his discretionary “time permitting” task list:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A session for Russia's      Environmental Safety Agency (EKON), making observations and taking KPT-3      aerial photography of environmental conditions on earth using the Nikon      D2X with the SIGMA 300-800mm telephoto lens.</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another run with      the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane)      earth-imaging program, using the NIKON D2X digital camera to take      800mm-lens telephotos for subsequent downlinking on the BSR-TM payload      data channel,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Urine transfer to the Progress Rodnik tankage,      and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">An      audit/inventory of TP-TRG-L thermally conducting gaskets for various      electronic components such as GIVUS A6, the TVM &amp; TsVM Computers, and      SNT Voltage &amp; Current Stabilizers.</li> </ul> 
 Conjunction Advisory:   No maneuver required.
