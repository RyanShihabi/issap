All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  Saturday – rest day for CDR Fincke, FE-1 Lonchakov &amp; FE-2 Magnus.
 
 FE-2 Magnus started the day with the daily download of the accumulated data of the SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) experiment from her Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of another week-long session with SLEEP, her third.     [To monitor the crewmember's sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment's laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days, as part of the crew's discretionary “job jar” task list.
 
 CDR Fincke &amp; FE-1 Lonchakov spent an hour with unloading cargo from Progress M0-66/32P, logging moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System) with the BCR (Bar Code Reader.
 
 As part of Progress unloading, Yuri then transferred a number of new science experiments to the ISS, photo documenting the moves , viz.:
 
 <ul><li>STRUCTURA Luch-2 (to obtain protein crystals with highly ideal crystal structure);  <li>TKhN-9 CRYSTALLIZER hardware (to obtain protein crystals with highly ideal crystal structure);  <li>BIOECOLOGY - LAKTOLEN;  (effects of micro-G on growth, genetic &amp; physiological properties of Lactolen-producing cells);  <li>BIOECOLOGY - GINSENG-2 (to study and research new bio-producers and biologically hyperactive plant genotypes).

 For today's discretionary VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) program, Fincke &amp; Magnus had selected sessions with LOCAD-PTS and SPICE.  For LOCAD-PTS (Lab-on-a-Chip Application Development-Portable Test System) Phase 1, Mike applied media slides to a single sampling site and then performed four swabs adjacent to that area.    [This was the first side-by-side sampling using all three different types of cartridges, allowing for detection of Gram Negative and Gram Positive Bacteria, as well as yeasts and molds.]
 
 The second VolSci program, the new US payload SPICE (Smoke Point In Co-flow Experiment), conducted by Mike &amp; Sandy in the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), controlled by its A341p with SPICE microdrives, is testing six different fuels, each using three different burner sizes, and each burner size requires six test points.    [Looping through the test procedure three times, each fuel thus requires eighteen test points, and today's run involved two groups of six test points each for a total of twelve.  More test points are scheduled next week.  SPICE determines the point at which gas-jet flames (similar to a butane-lighter flame) begin to emit soot (dark carbonaceous particulate formed inside the flame) in microgravity.  Studying a soot emitting flame is important in understanding the ability of fires to spread and in control of soot in practical combustion systems in space.] 
 
 FE-1 Lonchakov continued the current (third) run of the DAKON-M hardware for the Russian experiment TEKh-15/IZGIB (“Bend”) for untended measurement of micro-accelerations.  The activity requires Yuri to visually control hardware operations three times a day and report to the ground.  The second IZGIB session was conducted by Sergei Volkov on 10/15-19/08.    [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.] 
 
 Later, the FE-1 completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and performing US condensate processing (transfer from CWC to EDV containers) if condensate is available.] 
 Yuri also conducted the regular daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance task by updating/editing the IMS standard “delta file” including stowage locations for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 At ~8:00am EST, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
 The CDR &amp; FE-2 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Mike at ~11:15am, Sandy at ~1:40pm.
