ISS On-Orbit Status 10/10/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday –  Crew rest day. First full day with the Exp-25 six-member crew.  Ahead: Week 3 of Increment 25. 
 
 Yest kasaniya!   Soyuz TMA-01M/24S docked successfully last evening at 8:01pm EDT at the MRM2 “Poisk” module zenith port, 1 min ahead of schedule, on Soyuz orbit #33 (DO1), 5 min before local sunset. This doubles the station crew size to 6 persons and brings the total number of currently docked Russian VVs (visiting vehicles) to 4:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Soyuz TMA-01M/24S (#701) @      MRM2 “Poisk”      zenith,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Soyuz TMA-19/23S (#229) @      MRM1 “Rassvet”</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Progress M-05M/37P (#405)      @ DC-1 nadir</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Progress M-07M/39P 39P      (#407) @ SM aft.  </li> </ul> 
  It was also the 67<sup>th</sup> Russian flight to ISS (out of a total of 103 missions).
 
  TMA-01M/24S delivered Exp-25 crewmembers FE-1 Alexander “Sasha” Kaleri, FE-2 Oleg “Alik” Skripochka &amp; FE-3 Scott Kelly.    [For Skripochka, it is the first spaceflight, for Kelly, who flew on STS-103/HubbleRepair &amp; STS-118, it is the third, and for Kaleri, past crewmember of ISS Exp-8 and Mir expeditions 11, 22 &amp; 28, it is the fifth, making him currently one of the most experienced space fliers in the world.] 
 Welcome aboard, Scott, Alex and Oleg!
 
  The newcomers joined CDR Douglas “Wheels” Wheelock, FE-5 Fyodor “Fedya” Yurchikhin &amp; FE-6 Shannon Walker.   After 3h1m spent in Soyuz on pre-transfer activities, hatches were opened at 11:10pm and the crew transferred to the ISS.  This was followed by the traditional welcome event and the installation of the BZV QD (quick disconnect) clamps of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) by Kaleri, to rigidize the joint.      [The Soyuz TV system was activated at ~7:17pm EDT; final approach on automatic KURS pilot began at ~7:52pm.  Shortly after "kasaniya" (contact), automatic "sborka" (closing of Soyuz &amp; SM port hooks &amp; latches) took place at ~8:11pm with ISS in free drift.  Attitude control authority had been handed over to the Russian MCS (Motion Control System) thrusters at ~5:08pm and returned to US CMG (Control Moment Gyroscope) control at ~9:25pm.  For the docking, Russian thrusters were disabled (9:45pm-11:50pm) during Soyuz volume pressurization &amp; clamp installation and afterwards returned to active attitude control.  Before hatch opening, the crew performed leak checks of the Soyuz modules and the Soyuz/MRM2 interface vestibule.  They then doffed their Sokol suits, and Skripochka &amp; Kaleri set suits and gloves up for drying.  Alex also deactivated the BOA/Atmosphere Purification Unit in the SA/Descent Module, replaced the Soyuz ECLSS LiOH cartridges, equalized Soyuz/ISS pressures, and put the spacecraft into conservation mode on ISS integrated power.  Note: During final approach, the Soyuz crew reported that the Neptun InPU-1 (Display Panel #1) performed an uncommanded reboot.  Specialists will be reviewing this discrepancy.]
 
 Sleep cycle shift:  To accommodate last night’s arrival of Soyuz TMA-01M/24S at ~8:01pm, crew wake/sleep cycle changes were put in effect, featuring a two-part Saturday workday and a workfree Sunday:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Wake (Saturday)      –  2:00am EDT</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Lunch (Saturday)      – 9:00am</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Sleep 1 (Saturday)      – 10:00am </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Wake 1 (Saturday)      –  2:00pm</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Sleep 2 (Sunday, today)      – 4:30am  (work free)</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Wake 2 (Monday,      tomorrow) –  2:00am – returning to nominal.</li> </ul> 
  At ~1:30pm today, CDR Doug Wheelock interrupted his sleep period for about 20 min to remove the second set of six PADIAC ECs (Pathway Different Activators Experiment Containers) from the KUBIK-3 thermally controlled container and transferred them to BLB TCU2 (Biolab Thermal Control Unit 2) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory).     [PADIAC deals with cell biology, focusing on the all-important human immune system.  In microgravity, the activation process of T-cells, the immune system’s instruments, is altered. This could weaken the performance of the immune system.  Purpose of PADIAC is to activate human T-cells in micro-G by different activation “cocktails”.  Cells will be fixated at end of experiment run for on-ground analysis to (1) determine how micro-G affects expression of genes in human T-cells when using different activators, (2) distinguish micro-G effects from other spaceflight factors (using the on-board 1-g centrifuge), and (3) verify results of ground studies and previous space experiments.  Hoped-for benefit is a better understanding of signal transduction (pathways) in T-cells.  Outcome could help to find countermeasures against the influence of micro-G, especially for long term missions such as the human Mars expedition.  For the long experiment run, 6 ECs (+1 mass dummy, to establish proper mass in the container) were installed in KUBIK-6 (in EDR/European Drawer Rack) for 25h30m.  For the short run, 6 ECs (+1 mass dummy) were installed in the stand-alone KUBIK-3 and removed by Wheels today after 9h for transferring 6 ECs to BLB TCU2 and trashing the mass dummy.]
