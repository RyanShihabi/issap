ISS On-Orbit Status 09/12/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Progress unpacking day.   Ahead: Week 15 of Increment 24.
 
 Yest kasaniye!    At 7:57am EDT, Progress M-07M(39P) docked successfully to the SM (Service Module) aft port under automatic KURS control, followed by a final DPO post-contact thrusting burn, docking probe retraction and hook closure (“sborka”, ~8:04am) after motion damp-out while the ISS was in free drift for 20 min (7:58am-8:18am).  At “hooks closed” signal, the SM returned to active attitude control, maneuvering the ISS to LVLH TEA (local vertical/local horizontal Torque Equilibrium Attitude) at ~8:18am.  Control authority returned to US Momentum Management at ~9:00am.  Russian thrusters were disabled temporarily during clamps install and leak check (9:30am-11:25am).  All Progress systems operated nominally from automated rendezvous start at approximately 5:32am, Progress Kurs-A activation and testing, Kurs antenna retraction, and ending with successful approach &amp; docking.
 
  For monitoring 39P maneuvering and docking, Skvortsov &amp; Caldwell-Dyson set up the Ku-band video “scheme”.     [The crew configured the SSC-1 (Station Support Computer 1) A31p laptop in the FGB and activated the VWS (Video Streaming Workstation) laptop for both the conversion and the “streaming” MPEG2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoding in order to downlink “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band. The previously used ESA MPEG2 Encoder in the SM was not used, in favor of the more stable VWS.] 
 
  Also before docking, the amateur/ham radio equipment was deactivated to prevent RF interference with the Progress KURS radio control system.
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson installed the four snubber alignment guides at the T2 treadmill to protect the exercise device.  After the docking and before first exercise run, Doug Wheelock removed the guides.
 
  In addition, Tracy closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Kibo &amp; Cupola science windows.
 
  Also before the docking, FE-3 Kornienko switched the KRIOGEM-03M container to +4 degC and the TBU thermostat-controlled incubator to +29 degC.
 
  After the cargo ship’s docking, Alex Skvortsov &amp; Mikhail Kornienko shut off the TORU teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system, used as manual standby, and reconfigured the STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to normal ops.     [The "Voskhod-M" STTS enables telephone communications between the SM, FGB, DC-1 and USOS, and also with users on the ground over VHF channels selected by an operator at an SM comm panel, via STTS antennas on the SM’s outside.  There are six comm panels in the SM with pushbuttons for accessing any of three audio channels, plus an intercom channel.  Other modes of the STTS include telegraphy (teletype), EVA voice, emergency alarms, Packet/Email, and TORU docking support].
 
  The crewmembers then conducted the standard one-hour leak checking of the docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and the SM Transfer Compartment.
 
  Later today, the Russian crewmembers –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Opened      the hatches (~11:00am) and installed the QD (quick disconnect)      screw clamps (BZV)      of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling (CDR); </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Performed the standard air      sampling inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M      air sampler (FE-5); </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Powered down the      spacecraft and installing the ventilation/heating air duct (CDR); </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Took photographs of the      internal docking surfaces for subsequent downlinking (FE-5),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1">Dismantled the docking      mechanism (StM,      Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the SM      (~12:00pm)   [the StM      is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active      docking assembly (ASA)      with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking      assembly (PSA)      for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted      on the Progress' cargo module (GrO),      while the PSA      sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB and DC-1], and</li> </ul> <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Transferred a number of      Russian high priority biotechnology payloads to the ISS, setting      them up in the RS (Russian Segment) and taking documentary photography of      each:  </li> </ul> <?if !supportLists?>o    <?endif?>BTKh-5/LAKTOLEN (to Bioecology containers in SM),

  Shannon Walker handled the high-priority transfer &amp; installation of two critical science payloads from Progress –
 <?if !supportLists?>o    <?endif?>ESA SODI (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument Experiment) and
 <?if !supportLists?>o    <?endif?>JAXA PCG (Protein Crystal Growth) canister – installed in the PCRF (Protein Crystallization Research Facility) and PCRF cables connected.
 
  Yurchikhin then had ~1.5 hr reserved on his timeline for the first cargo transfers from the Progress to the ISS.
 
  On the US side, Caldwell-Dyson disassembled &amp; removed the RS video “scheme” while Wheelock powered up the amateur/ham radio equipment in the SM.
 
  Before Progress approach &amp; docking, CDR Skvortsov at wakeup conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, FE-4 Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker continued their week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 4<sup>th</sup> for Doug &amp; Shannon, 8<sup>th</sup> for Tracy, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  After wake-up, Tracy began Day 2 of her current 4-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 5<sup>th</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
  In the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-5 Wheelock wrapped up his maintenance of the FPEF MI (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility / Marangoni Inside) payload, “backing out”, i.e., reversing the original disassembly steps.     [Steps included installation of the FPEF MI core into the MI body, installing the PFEF MI into the FPEF, closing the experiment cover body, connecting the payload bus cable, installing the silicone hose, connecting IPU (Image Processing Unit) user video cables between FPEF and IPU &amp; closing out the MS MWA I/F B &amp; A (Marangoni / Maintenance Work Area / Interfaces A &amp; B).]
 
  Fyodor Yurchikhin used the Progress docking for another test of the new external Klest (KL-154M) TV camera, recording footage on the SONY HVR-Z1 camcorder for playback and subsequent downlink via Ku-band (~10:00am).    [The video camera was installed outside the SM by Kornienko &amp; Yurchikhin during their EVA-25 on 7/27.]
 
  Shannon Walker continued her support of the ground-commanded CFE (Capillary Flow Experiment) payload by powering the hardware on for POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center/Huntsville) at ~11:45am and turning it off about 2 hrs later.     [CFE is a suite of fluid physics experiments that investigate capillary flows and flows of fluids in containers with complex geometries.  CFE takes advantage of the station’s micro-G environment to investigate the special dynamics of capillary flow, i.e., the interaction of liquid with solid that can draw a fluid up a narrow tube and can be exploited to control fluid orientation so that fluid systems on spacecraft perform predictably.  Interest is in the critical wetting angles for various container geometries and determination of the hysteresis to a higher accuracy than before.  CFE results will have applications to management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions, and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems. CFE has applications to the management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.  ICF (Interior Corner Flow) is one of three CFE experiments, the others being Vane Gap (VG) and Contact Line (CL).  Each of the CFE experiments is represented with two unique experimental units (1,2), all of which use similar fluid-injection hardware, have simple and similarly sized test chambers, and rely solely on video for highly quantitative data.  Silicone oil is the fluid used for all the tests, with different viscosities depending on the unit.  Differences between units are primarily fluid properties, wetting conditions, and test cell cross section.]
 
  Kornienko did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  Mikhail also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-3).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after the last T2 session of the day but is now regularly being done once a week after the last T2 session.]
  
  No CEO (Crew Earth Observations) photo targets uplinked for today.
