Kubik 6:  After completing commissioning for ESA’s Kubik 6 facility the crew disconnected and stowed the Kubik 6.  Kubik is a small controlled-temperature incubator/cooler used to study biological samples in a microgravity environment.  It is equipped with removable inserts designed for self-contained, automatic experiments using seeds, cells, and small animals.
Electro-static Levitation Furnace (ELF):  The crew exchanged the sample cartridges in ELF and stowed the processed sample for return.  ELF is an experimental facility designed to levitate, melt and solidify materials by containerless processing techniques using the electrostatic levitation method.  With this facility thermophysical properties of high temperature melts can be measured and solidification from deeply undercooled melts can be achieved. 
Barrios Protein Crystal Growth (PCG):  The crew mixed solutions in a crystallization plate.  Barrios PCG focuses on the successful transfer and mixing of different solutions into commercial off-the-shelf multiwell plates. Video of the growth of the protein crystals in the multiwell plates will be downlinked for evaluation. 
Orbital ATK (OA)-9 Cygnus:  The crew completed a training session to practice emergency response actions that need to be taken with Cygnus attached.  They also continued with Cygnus cargo operations. 
Soyuz (53S) Return Cargo Packing: The crew started packing the cargo that will return on 53S. The remaining packing will be completed prior to undocking. 
External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) Disassembly:  The crew disassembled the ETVCG that was retrieved from Camera Port (CP)-13 during EVA #50 on May 16, 2018 and removed the Pan and Tilt Unit (PTU) with the Television Camera Interface Converter (TVCIC). The TVCIC was then removed and stowed.  The crew will install a new TVCIC on the PTU and then reassemble the ETVCG at a later date. The newly assembled ETVCG will be installed at Camera Port CP-3 during EVA #51.
