Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation:  The USOS crew members performed final preparations for the upcoming EVAs.  Today, they reviewed the detailed EVA timeline, briefing package, and crib sheet then completed final tool configuration. In addition, they set up the Equipment Lock, EMUs, and ancillary hardware to support the upcoming EVA. The EVA to install International Docking Adapter (IDA) cables is now scheduled for Saturday, 21 February. 
Aniso Tubule:  Virts injected water into an Aniso sample chamber and stowed the chamber into MELFI cold stowage.  This began run #8, which will continue for 9 days.  Experimenters will examine growth modifications of Arabidopsis hypocotyls and the changing orientation of cortical microtubule under microgravity conditions in space.  Scientists will further observe changes in dynamics of cortical microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins by observing Arabidopsis hypocotyls and microtubule-associated proteins with a fluorescence microscope.
Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) Status:  Flight Controllers power-cycled the UPA this morning, took it to standby for 6 hours and observed no recurrences of the high pressure fault from the P11 pressure switch. They then commanded UPA to process and the high pressure fault recurred after about an hour. The Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) remains configured for internal tank (EDV), while ground teams continue to investigate the UPA issue.
Network Monitoring System (NMS) Software Deploy:  Overnight, the NMS software was successfully deployed on the NMS laptop.  The NMS laptop will provide near real time network monitoring for greater insight into the Joint Station Local Area Network (JSL).
