ISS On-Orbit Status 04/10/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday –  Ahead: Week 5 of Increment 27.
 
Upon wake-up, CDR Kondratyev &amp; FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  This was another of a succession of joint “handover”-activities, timelined to familiarize the newcomers with onboard routine tasks.      [Dima &amp; Sasha will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 23<sup>rd</sup> for Paolo &amp; Cady.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Nespoli started his 4<sup>th</sup> (FD120) suite of sessions with the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.      [For Pro K, there will be five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
Coleman had one more opportunity for filling the UPA WSTA (Urine Processor Assembly / Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly) to the desired level, not exceeding ~70%, from an EDV-U container to allow the planned RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) replacement tomorrow.     [The WRS (Water Recovery System) EDV-U remains connected to the WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly) via EDV transfer hose and the Russian compressor, powered from the Ku-band power source.]
 
In the Soyuz TMA-20/25S spacecraft, docked at the MRM1, Kondratyev turned off the GA/gas analyzer (KM0305M1, #091) which he had activated on 4/7 for the periodic checkup of the cabin air.
 
Meanwhile, Samokutyayev did likewise in the newly arrived Soyuz TMA-21/26S (#231), docked at the MRM2 “Poisk” at FGB nadir, powering off the GA in the SA/Descent Module.
 
Later, Dmitri &amp; Alex conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
FE-3 Garan continued his familiarization with CMS (Countermeasures Systems) exercise equipment, receiving hands-on training by observing experienced crewmembers – today FE-1 Samokutyayev on the Russian VELO ergometer bike.
 
The ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) suffered another failure of its right VIS (Vibration Isolation System) x-rotation dashpot and is currently considered No-Go for the crew.  Questions were uplinked to support troubleshooting by ground engineers.      [This dashpot has caused trouble before.]
 
At ~5:20am EDT, the three Russian crewmembers supported two Russian PAO TV downlinks of greetings, the first with answers to children questions to the World Ocean Museum in Kaliningrad which is hosting a “Conversations With Space” event for Kaliningrad region schoolchildren, the 2<sup>nd</sup> to the personnel and guests at a celebration in Baikonur on 4/11 in the Saturn Movie &amp; Concert Theater, commemorating the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary or Yuri Gagarin’ space flight.     [“…Dear Baikonur colleagues, the crew of Expedition 27 to the International Space Station is extending their warm greetings to you from orbit and would like to congratulate you on the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first human space flight!  In 1961, Yuri Gagarin started his historic flight from the Baikonur launch site.  This has become a new landmark for the entire world community.  This event gave start to the era of manned space flights which successfully continues now.  We are happy to celebrate this international holiday on orbit.  It is very emotional, today, each one of us has a little bit of Gagarin inside.  Like he, we see our beautiful Earth in all its splendor.  Dear Friends, thank you for your high level of professionalism!  Cosmonauts and astronauts who launch from Baikonur have full faith in those to whom the trust with their lives.  We wish prosperity and long years of success in space to Baikonur and its people!  Happy holiday! Happiness to everybody!”]
 
At ~6:30am, in another Russian PAO TV event Kondratyev, Garan &amp; Samokutyayev responded to interview questions from Yulia Pankratova, the News anchor of Channel One.    [To Dmitri: “Compared to your colleagues you are a veteran.  When cosmonauts arrive to the station for the first time what surprises them most?”  To Alexandr:  “Every crew has its own call sign.  What is yours? And, in general, what is it for?  Your vehicle had a name – Gagarin.  Did you feel responsibility or did you try to just not think about it?”  To Ron:  You were born in 1961, the year of the first space flight.  Do you believe in numbers magic?  You have three sons.  Do they think about space?  How difficult is learning Russian for you?”] 
 
At ~6:45am, FE-1 Samokutyayev had another Russian PAO TV call, answering questions uplinked from “Soviet Sport” newspaper.    [The paper, aware that one of Sasha’s hobbies is ice hockey, is preparing a special insert on April 12 to mark the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first human space flight.]
 
At ~12:10pm, Ron Garan had his 3<sup>rd</sup> post-launch PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
FE-3, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Paolo at ~8:00am, Ron at ~12:30pm, Cady at ~4:15pm EDT.
 
CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise.     [T2 snubber arm inspection must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
