69 Progress (69P) Docking:  This morning the 69P vehicle docked to the SM aft port of the ISS.  Rendezvous and docking both completed successfully in the automated mode with a preliminary docking capture time of 4:38:43 AM CST.  
Lighting Effects: Upon wakeup, a 53S subject provided a daily sleep log entry to track his sleep patterns and wakefulness. The Lighting Effects experiment hopes to better quantify and qualify how lighting can effect habitability of spacecraft. The light bulbs on the ISS are being replaced with a new system designed for improved crew health and wellness. The Lighting Effects investigation studies the impact of the change from fluorescent light bulbs to solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with adjustable intensity and color and aims to determine if the new lights can improve crew circadian rhythms, sleep, and cognitive performance. Results from this investigation also have major implications for people on Earth who use electric lights.
Earth Imagery from ISS Target (EIISS): Using the RED camera, the crew captured images of the Caribbean and the Baja Peninsula. EIISS is used to support creation of a series of videos showcasing Earth views taken from space. The videos are taken with cameras on the ISS in 6K hi-resolution and are integrated into videos for screensavers for public enjoyment, exploration, and engagement.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation:  Today the USOS Crew completed final Equipment Lock configuration and tool checks in preparation for Friday’s EVA.  Detailed reviews of Cuff Checklists, the EVA Briefing Package, Detailed Timeline, Tool Configuration Summary, Sharp Edge Briefing, and SSU Systems Briefing Package completed EVA preparation.  Scheduled egress from the Joint Airlock is tomorrow morning at 6:10 AM CST.
