U.S. Crew Half Duty Day: Following yesterday’s successful EVA, today was a half duty day for the US crew. They executed standard post EVA activities including a Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) water recharge, returning equipment to the Airlock, Metal Oxide (METOX) regeneration, battery maintenance, and a debrief with ground teams. 
Habitability Observations: The crew documented and submitted observations per tasks from the last few weeks related to human factors and habitability. The crew selects from various topics including housekeeping activities, trash management, accumulation of dust, items not stowed, frequency of housekeeping, and effectiveness of housekeeping tools. The investigation collects observations about the relationship between crewmembers and their environment on the ISS. Observations can help spacecraft designers understand how much habitable volume is required, and whether a mission’s duration impacts how much space crew members need.
Space Headaches Questionnaire: The crew performed their weekly questionnaire, answering questions utilizing the Data Collection Tool. The European Space Agency (ESA) investigation collects information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement in the well-being and performance of crewmembers in space. Headaches during space flight can negatively affect mental and physical capacities of crewmembers that can influence performance during a space mission.
