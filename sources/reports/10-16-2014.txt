NanoRacks Module 9:  Wilmore performed session 4 of 5 Nanoracks Module 9. He retrieved the module and activated/deactivated/shook the designated mixture tubes to facilitate NanoRacks Module-9 experiments. Module-9 is a collection of student research projects utilizing the NanoRacks Mixsticks. The NanoRacks-National Center for Earth and Space Science Education investigation results from a commercial Science Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education program overseen by the National Center for Earth and Space Science Education (NCESSE), called the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP). Student teams from across the United States design their own experiments using flight approved fluids and materials. The investigation consists of 19 different science experiments flown in a NanoRacks Module on board the International Space Station (ISS).
NanoRacks:  Wilmore removed Nanoracks Modules 16, 18, 20, 21 and 22 from inside the Nanoracks Platform. He also removed Modules 28 and 31 from inside the Nanoracks Platform-2 and configured all modules for return on SpaceX-4.
Post Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Activities:  The Crew performed a variety of tasks following yesterday’s successful EVA-28.  Wisemen and Wilmore performed their post-EVA medical assessments.  Wiseman also performed a water dump and fill of the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) feedwater tanks to prepare them for stowage and initiated a charge cycle for the Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly (REBA). All three US Crew members participated in a post-EVA debrief with ground specialists.  Lastly, Wiseman and Wilmore performed a deconfiguration of the airlock.
Oxygen Generation System (OGS) Hydrogen Sensor Remove & Replace (R&R): Today Gerst replaced the OGS Hydrogen Sensor.  This sensor has reached the end of its lifetime of 150 days of operations.
