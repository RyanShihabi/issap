Payloads:
Actiwatch Plus: Arriving Crew-3 crewmembers donned Actiwatch Plus devices on their non-dominant wrist and outside of clothing for data collection. The Actiwatch is a waterproof, nonintrusive, sleep-wake activity monitor worn on the wrist of a crewmember. The device contains a miniature uniaxial accelerometer that produces a signal as the subject moves. The data is stored in nonvolatile memory within the Actiwatch until it is downloaded for analysis.
Manufacturing Device (MAND): A 3D print was removed and stowed. A crewmember also cleaned the extruder nozzle. MAND enables the production of components on the ISS for both NASA and commercial objectives. Parts, entire experiments, and tools can be created on demand utilizing the MAND printer, which can produce parts out of a wide variety of thermopolymers including engineered plastics.
Systems:
ISS Safety Briefing: The 65S crew familiarized the newly arrived Dragon Endurance crew with the potential hazards and available safety measures on-board ISS as well as the equipment needed for initial emergency response.
