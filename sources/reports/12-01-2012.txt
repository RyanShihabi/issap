ISS On-Orbit Status 12/01/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty.
 
CDR Ford started the day with another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, his 9<sup>th</sup>.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS. The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
After wakeup, FE-1 Novitskiy performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection and also .  
 
FE-1 also completed the daily reboot of the Russian RS1 &amp; RS2 laptops.
 
Additionally, Oleg conducted the periodic checkup of the circuit breakers &amp; fuses in the DC1 Docking Compartment.     [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 &amp; MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.  MRM2 &amp; MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.]
 
FE-2 Tarelkin rebooted the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops.
 
Kevin Ford performed the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 &amp; O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.
 
Working as a team, Ford, Novitskiy &amp; Tarelkin conducted the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including all USOS (US Orbit Segment) modules like Lab, Nodes, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, FE-1 &amp; FE-2 conducted regular weekly maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), the grilles of the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System,and the SKV air conditioner in the SM.
 
Evgeny completed the daily routine task of servicing the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Tarelkin also performed the periodic cleaning of Russian Potok-150МК (150 micron) pre-filters of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem.
 
Kevin filled out his standard FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop Terminal).  It was the 4<sup>th</sup> time for the CDR.    [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] 
 
Later, Ford spent some time on troubleshooting an SMPA (Scope Meter Power Adapter)/Charger and Makita batteries.     [After marking SMPA/Charger 1007 “Suspect” and stowing it, Kevin moved SMPA/Charger 1008 from the Kibo JPM to the Lab, connected it and monitored it during charging of battery #1053, checking indicator lights. If no lights, battery charging was to be continued overnight.] 
 
The CDR again had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journals on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
At ~6:30am EST, Evgeny Tarelkin had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
At ~8:10am, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
The three crewmembers worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2).
 
Tasks listed for Evgeny &amp; Oleg on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
