Vascular Echo: Crewmembers performed Scan and blood pressure measurements and took historical documentation photos in support of the Vascular Echo study. Cardiac and Vessel Structure and Function with Long-Duration Space Flight and Recovery (Vascular Echo) examines changes in blood vessels, and the heart, while the crew members are in space, and then follow their recovery on return to Earth. The results could provide insight into potential countermeasures to help maintain crewmember health, and quality of life for everyone.Â
