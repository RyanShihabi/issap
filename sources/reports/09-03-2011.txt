ISS On-Orbit Status 09/03/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew half-day off duty. 
 
As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel.
 
CDR Borisenko continued the 2<sup>nd</sup> test series of the Russian ASN-M Satellite Navigation System, which requires him to monitor communications between the RSK2 A31p laptop with the test program and the three active ASN NPM-1, NPM-3 &amp; NPM-4 navigation electronics modules every 2 hrs during work hours.       [The objective of the test is to confirm that array configurations for ATV docking in negative Solar Beta angles do not create unacceptable multipathing for the ASN RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System).  Both TRRJs (Thermal Radiator Rotary Joints) and both SARJs (Solar Alpha Rotary Joints) plus the 1B, 2B, 3A &amp; 4A BGAs (Beta Gimbal Assemblies) were placed in Directed position for this test (i.e., not autotrack).  The test will include 4 different array configurations, with periods of autotrack in between for power generation recovery.  The test is planned to be complete late tomorrow evening.]
 
The six crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).  As part of today’s Uborka, FE-5 Furukawa took documentary photographs of the RGSH AORG (Return Grid Sensor Housing add-on screens) at COL D0 before and after going over them with the vacuum cleaner (to be compared with pictures taken during previous cleaning to establish the quantity of debris captured during the week).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, FE-1 Samokutyayev completed regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection.
 
FE-4 Volkov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
At ~8:35am EDT, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
Borisenko deactivated the GA/gas analyzer (KM0305M1) in the Soyuz TMA-21/26S (#231) spacecraft, docked at MRM2 Poisk, and FE-4 Volkov did the same in “his” Soyuz TMA-02M/27S (#702), docked at MRM1 Rassvet.    [The GA’s were activated on 8/30, which is done periodically to check the cabin air in the Descent Modules.]
 
FE-3 Garan opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Ron will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
For today’s VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activities, FE-6 Fossum filmed more 3D scenes with the European ERB-2 (Erasmus Recording Binocular 2) camera.        [After first charging batteries for the ERB-2, Mike took the camera from its multi-use bracket on the EDR (European Drawer Rack), adjusted its settings and then filmed onboard scenes.  Afterwards, FE-6 remounted ERB-2 at the EDR and turned on the E2 OUT2 switch of the EDR’s ESEM4 (Exchangeable Standard Electronic Module 4) for downlinking.  The stereoscopic ERB-2 has produced the first live 3-D video images in the 50-year history of spaceflight aboard the ISS for ESA's Research &amp; Technology Center in the Netherlands.]
 
Having selected two VolSci tasks, FE-5 Furukawa first serviced the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), wiping out the inside of the Micro-G IU (Incubator Unit) and sample tray, then the 1G IU and its centrifuge.
 
For the second activity, a JAXA EPO (Education Payload Operation), Satoshi was to compose a five-line Space Poem in Japanese on his feelings in space.       [The activity included writing the poem down in large Japanese letters for subsequent video viewing, then reading the poem at an ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) and explaining its background while exposing it to the JPM INT-P internal camera, with Ron Garan taking supportive photography at the JPM window showing Earth and/or ISS external structure.  Satoshi later closed the Kibo window again.] 
 
Volkov performed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and ensured proper watering of the KM A32 &amp; A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)],
 
At ~10:15am EDT, Mike Fossum had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6).
