Fluid Shifts:   Kornienko continued his Return minus 45 day (R-45) Fluid Shifts activities today in the Russian Segment with assistance from Kelly and Volkov and guidance from the ground team.   He performed Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Cerebral and Cochlear Fluid Pressure (CCFP) and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) tests, and a Tonometry exam.  He also completed the part of the experiment utilizing the Russian Chibis (Lower Body Negative Pressure – LBNP) suit during ultrasound measurements.  Fluid Shifts investigates the causes for severe and lasting physical changes to astronaut’s eyes. Because the headward fluid shift is a hypothesized contributor to these changes, reversing this fluid shift with a lower body negative pressure device is investigated as a possible intervention.  Results from this study may help to develop preventative measures against lasting changes in vision and eye damage.
 
Sleep Log:  Kelly recorded a Sleep Log entry today after waking. The Sleep ISS-12 experiment monitors ambient light exposure and crew member activity and collects subjective evaluations of sleep and alertness.  The investigation examines the effects of space flight and ambient light exposure on sleep during a year-long mission on the ISS.
 
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation:  The USOS Crew carried out their final Equipment Lock and Tool preparations in support of tomorrow’s Sequential Shunt Unit (SSU) EVA.  In addition, they printed and reviewed Cuff Checklist procedures, reviewed an EVA Briefing Package, Detailed Timeline, Tool Configuration Summary, Sharp Edge Briefing, and SSU Systems Briefing Package.  Egress from the Joint Airlock is scheduled to occur tomorrow morning at 6:55am CST.
