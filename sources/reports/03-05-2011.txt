FE-6 Cady Coleman collected her first dry saliva samples of the biomed experiment INTEGRATED IMMUNE, five samplings of 1 min each spread over the day – upon waking (before eating, drinking, or brushing teeth), then 30 min, 6 hrs &amp; 10 hrs after waking and before retiring/sleep.      [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmember soak a piece of cotton inside their mouth and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned on the Shuttle so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
Also early in the morning, FE-5 Paolo Nespoli collected body samples from Cady Coleman, MS-3 Mike Barratt &amp; himself in support of the JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), then inserted the specimen into MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) at +2 degC for preservation.      [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss.]
 
Alex Kaleri terminated overnight (10-hr) charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery for the Piren-V Pyro-endoscope, part of the Russian BAR science instruments suite (other BAR components being the ТТМ-2 Anemometer-Thermometer, the charger cable, and the video display unit).
 
CDR Kelly spent most of his day working with the ground on OGS (Oxygen Generation System) maintenance in Node-3, flushing the system after cooldown, installing a filter system to scrub the OGS Recirculation Loop water, drawing two samples, one for future conductivity (pH value) measurements by the crew, the other for return to the ground, then removing the temporary filters, installing an adapter to gather pressure data, and closing up after leak checks.       [The activity was intended to provide pre- and post-filtration samples and pressure data for developing a long-term remediation configuration to remedy the low pH issue of the recirculation loop which limits the OGS running time.  Because the delta-pressure sensor in the water pump assembly is failed, pump current is being adjusted from the ground to keep maximum delta-pressure below maximum value. ] 
 
FE-6 Coleman changed the N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) supply setup for supporting the OGS activities, then also reconfigured the O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) transfer valving to provide Shuttle O<sub>2</sub> to the ISS high-pressure tanks only.
 
Afterwards, Cady joined Shuttle crewmembers Steve Lindsey, Eric Boe, Nicole Stott &amp; Al Drew in major reconfiguration/outfitting activities in the new PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) attached at Node-1 nadir.       [Focus for today was on dismantling four RSPs (Resupply Stowage Platforms (removal of fences/struts), unbolting two ISPs from the PMM, installing a ZSR (Zero-g Stowage Rack) from COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) F2 in PMM, plus cargo moves to reduce the overall clutter on ISS.  General stowage moves for the crew include PMM endcone cleanout, ULF5 unpacking, HTV-2 cargo unloading (4 parts), EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) &amp; PDGF (Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture) relocation, Node-2 D2 partial cleanup, JPM (JEM Pressurized Module)  A5 rack front cleanup, RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) consolidation &amp; relocation.]
 
FE-5 Nespoli performed maintenance on the Lab CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) to identify &amp; isolate the electrical short from the primary heaters to the chassis that caused the prime heater string malfunction on 2/28.      [Paolo took resistance measurements on the Bed 202 housing connection after cutting and insulating the power wires to the failed prime heater.  The CDRA continues to work nominally on the secondary heater string.  The second CDRA, in Node-3, is performing nominally after the replacement of its 202 Bed by Scott &amp; Cady on 3/3.]
 
With the Lab camcorder set to provide live coverage, Nespoli serviced the FIR FCF (Fluids Integrated Rack / Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility), replacing the Bio specimen with a fresh sample from slot 3 of the Bio kit.     [Activities included opening the rack doors, rotating the LMM SBA (Light Microscopy Module / Spindle Bracket Assembly) from the Operate to Service position and removing the used sample from the Bio Base for return to the Bio kit.  With the new sample installed, the SBA was rotated back to Operate, the upper &amp; lower FCF rack doors were closed, and POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center/Huntsville) was notified that the rack was ready for RPC (Remote Power Controller) activation.  The LMM-Bio experiment is designed for autonomous operation through scripts and ground-based commanding.  Crew time is required for the initial installation and check out in the FIR, sample change out, and removal from the FIR.]
 
Later, Paolo undertook the transfer of joint mission books from the Shuttle over to ISS.     [The new Warning books, contained in a Ziploc bag and CTB (Crew Transfer Bag), include the SODF (Station Operations Data Files) procedures for the docked mission and emergency situations.  Paolo gathered and trashed 3 old ULF4 books (from Lab, SM &amp; FGB), then deployed 3 new ULF5  books in their places.]
 
Afterwards, FE-6 relocated the VSW (Video Streaming Workstation) from Node-2 to the U.S. Lab to support the upcoming HTV2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 2) relocation robotics, and stowed excess equipment.
 
Cady Coleman took documentary photography of the latest MDS (Microbial Detection Sheet), #6, of the JAXA Microbe-2 experiment in its Ziploc bag with yeast and mold, then inserted it in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) at 4 degC.
 
In the SM (Service Module), FE-2 Skripochka performed the daily monitoring of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment which is taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle docked phase.  The data were later copied from the BUSD Control &amp; Data Gathering Unit to a USB-D-M-3 stick for downlink to the ground.  The BUSD archive was then deleted and the DAKON-M restarted.       [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
Scott Kelly conducted routine service on the WRS (Water Recovery System) by offloading the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) storage tank from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary port to a CWC-I (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine) bag.  The PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) could not be used during the offloading.      [Estimated offload time: 23 min.]
 
After first flushing the sampling gear, the CDR collected one urine specimen from each available Russian EDV-U urine container for return to Earth for analysis.     [Deferred from yesterday.]
 
Dmitri Kondratyev concluded his 2<sup>nd</sup> session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiograph) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2 protocol, started yesterday.      [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Dmitri doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]
 
FE-1 Kaleri performed the (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways which is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently twelve persons.       [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1].
 
Alex also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Kelly &amp; Nespoli filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
At ~10:08 am EST, Cady Coleman downlinked a PAO TV message of congratulation to POC (Payload Operations Center) at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL, on its 10th Anniversary.    [“Greetings to all of you at the Marshall Space Flight Center.  I’m Expedition 26 Flight Engineer Cady Coleman aboard the International Space Station.  My crewmates and I wanted to take a moment from our work up here to wish all of our friends and colleagues at the Payload Operations Center congratulations on the achievement of the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of your magnificent facility.  Since March of 2001, you have provided 24/7 support to us here on the station. And we’ve come to rely on you – from training us before our mission - to planning our science activities and ensuring they are carried out every day. Your work is invaluable to us. The ISS is a world class scientific laboratory like none other. The science is world-class and so are you.  Our sincerest thanks to you for a job well done and we look forward to the next 10 years.  Congratulations again and have a great anniversary.”]
 
The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1/2x, F-2, FE-4) and ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE2, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6).
 
Vozdukh Update:   The Russian Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber failed again overnight due to overheating of the pump.  The crew removed some noise-reducing padding and Vozdukh is now back up and running.     [This pump was not replaced as part of the Vozdukh BOA R&amp;R this week.  CO<sub>2</sub> remained at ~3 mmHg everywhere while Vozdukh was down.  Vozdukh is running in a lower mode (manual mode 4) to manage the heat load.  If Vozdukh fails again today, the preferred mitigation option would be to accelerate the pre-sleep Shuttle LiOH change-out by a few hours.]
 
Transfer Status:   Middeck transfer ahead of schedule with 89% complete:  Resupply 97%, return 81%;  ~108 lbs O<sub>2</sub> transferred tank to tank; 26 lbs N<sub>2</sub> transferred tank to tank.
