ISS On-Orbit Status 02/07/11
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.        Underway:  Week 12 of Increment 26.  
 
 FE-4 Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Before sleeptime, Dmitri will inspect the filters again, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-1 Kaleri’s morning inspection today included the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
 FE-6 Cady Coleman undertook her 8<sup>th</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for her last night.      [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
 Also at wake-up, CDR Kelly, FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 9<sup>th</sup> for Scott, the 10<sup>th</sup> for Cady &amp; Paolo.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Early in the day, Scott Kelly supported ground-commanded activation of the FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack) by setting its two power switches to On.
 
 Kaleri used the Russian KPT-12 payload with its BAR science instruments suite for about 2.5 hrs for taking temperature measurements at the MRM1 Rassvet module’s pressure shell.  Data were logged and downlinked via OCA.     [Objective of the Russian KPT-12/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-B is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
 Afterwards, Kaleri checked out settings of the Russian KPT-14 SHADOW-BEACON (Tenj-Mayak) experiment on the RSK2 laptop and RSK2/Kenwood D700 ”Sputnik” amateur radio communications.    [Objective of the experiment is the automatic retranslation of time tag (pre-planned executable) packets from ground stations.  SHADOW (or ECLIPSE), sponsored by Roskosmos and its leading Moscow research organization TSNIIMASH (Central Research Institute of Machine Building), employs VHF amateur radio (ham) operators around the globe (via ARISS/Amateur Radio on ISS) to help in observing refraction/scattering effects in artificial plasmas using the method of RF (radio frequency) sounding in space experiments under different geophysical conditions.  This is the experiment’s 5<sup>th</sup> run, after Oleg Skripochka conducted it for the 4<sup>th</sup> time on Exp-25 last December, preceded by Fyodor Yurchikhin last October, Yuri Malenchenko on Exp-16 in November 2007 and Mikhail Tyurin on Exp-14 in November 2006.]
 
 In further preparations for the Orlan EVA-28 on 2/16, FE-2 Skripochka &amp; FE-4 Kondratyev today first configured the STTS communications systems for DC1-based work, then set up the DC1 Docking Compartment and the SM PkhO (Transfer Compartment) for the spacewalk.  Dmitri later prepared and then tested the POV EVA support panels in the DC1 &amp; PkhO, including, from the DC1 &amp; PkhO POVs, the KVD (PEV/Pressure Equalization Valve) on the connecting hatch.    [Comm was later reconfigured for nominal ops.  During DC1 preps, Oleg &amp; Dmitri also prepacked some old items for disposal in Progress 39P and stowed science equipment in MRM1, except for the Photo-Gamma gear, to be installed during EVA-28.]
 
 Also in preparation for the spacewalk, Dmitri &amp; Oleg performed a 1-hr session each with the standard Russian MedOps procedure MO-6 (Hand-Cycle Ergometry) in the SM, assisting each other in turn and being supported by ground specialist tagup on two comm passes.      [Because cosmonauts in early Russian programs have shown noticeable decrease in arm muscle tone, TsUP/IBMP (MCC-Moscow/Institute of Biomedical Problems) physical fitness experts have groundruled the handgrip/arm tolerance test analysis (hand ergometry) as a standard pre-Orlan EVA requirement.  For MO-6, the subject dons the ECG (electrocardiogram) biomed harness, attaches three skin electrodes and plugs the harness into the PKO medical exam panel on the cycle ergometer.  The other crewmember assists.  The exercise itself starts after 10 seconds of complete rest, by manually rotating the cycle's pedals, set at 150 W, backwards until "complete exhaustion".]
 
 FE-6 Nespoli saved the complete set of data of his 2<sup>nd</sup> NEUROSPAT session of 2/4 on the EPM MEEMM (European Physiology Module / Multi-Electrode Electroencephalogram Measurement Module) and ESA MPL (Multipurpose Laptop) hard disk, then stowed the final equipment pieces.     [NeuroSpat investigates the ways in which crew members’ three-dimensional visual &amp; space perception is affected by long-duration stays in weightlessness.  The Hungarian/Belgian experiment involves two principal experimental tasks: Visual Orientation and Visuomotor Tracking, plus additional, standardized EEG tasks performed as a means of assessing general effects of the space station environment on EEG signals.  MEEMM is a subsection of the EPM facility, used for different types of non-invasive brain function investigations.  It can also easily be reconfigured to support research in the field of muscle physiology.]
 
 Nespoli next continued gathering US trash for loading on Progress 39P, for about an hour.
 
 For covering today’s HTV2 robotics operations, FE-6 Coleman activated the VSW (Video Streaming Workstation) and SSC-1 (Station Support Computer 1) laptops for downlinking converted NTSC MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.
 
 Cady also enabled the Cupola RWS UOP (Robotic Workstation / Utility Outlet Panel) for power-up in Node-3, connected the UOP DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) power bypass cable at the Cupola RWS and installed the CCR (Cupola Crew Restraint) in the Cupola.    [After the Robotics ops, the setup was returned to its original conditions, including VSW.]
 
 Kelly, Nespoli &amp; Coleman then worked with the Japanese RMS (Robotic Maneuvering System) in the JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and the Canadian SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) in the U.S. Lab to return the EP (Exposed Pallet) to the HTV2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 2).     [After the very successful transfer of the two NASA payloads FHRC (Flex Hose Rotary Coupler) and CTC (Cargo Transport Container) from the EP on 2/3 with the SSRMS/SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator), CDR Kelly today set up the DOUG (Dynamic Orbital Ubiquitous Graphics) in the JPM, grappled the EP on its location on the EF (Exposed Facility) and handed it off to the SSRMS, operated by Paolo &amp; Cady.  After the handover, the EP was moved to the HTV2 and installed in the ULC (Unpressurized Logistics Carrier) in the HTV’s flank.  Cady finally parked the SSRMS at the HTV2 pre-grapple position.] 
 
 In preparation of HTV2 departure viewing, Nespoli executed an uplinked procedure to calibrate the external TV camera on the MBS MT (Mobile Base System / Mobile Transporter) and the lower outboard video camera on the S1 truss (S1LOOB).
 
 Later, Paolo initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.    [This was the 16<sup>th</sup> session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 Oleg Skripochka continued the extended leak integrity checking of the spare BZh Liquid Unit (#056) for the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator, repressed on 1/10 with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to 1 atm (1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), by conducting the usual pressure check and recharging it with N<sub>2</sub> from BPA-1M Nitrogen Purge Unit as required to verify the unit’s hermeticity.     [Objective of the monthly checkout of the spare BZh, which has been in stowage since March 2007, is to check for leakage and good water passage through the feed line inside of the BZh (from ZL1 connector to the buffer tank) and to check the response of the Electronics Unit’s micro switches (signaling “Buffer Tank is Empty” &amp; “Buffer Tank is Full”.  During Elektron operation, the inert gas locked up in the BZh has the purpose to prevent dangerous O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> mixing.  A leaking BZh cannot be used.]
 
 On the Soyuz 24S/MRM2 docking interface, Skripochka tightened the BZV quick release screw clamps of the SSVP docking mechanism, a periodic task.
 
 Later, Oleg performed maintenance on the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system in the SM, installing one (ZU2B) of its four ZU memory/recording devices (EA025M) in place of the ZU1A device, i.e., reversing an activity conducted by Alex on 2/2.  BITS2-12 and VD-SU control mode were unpowered during the operation.  The removed ZU1A was set aside for now.    [BITS2-12 is the primary telemetry downlink path for both FGB and SM parameters.  The system collects, records, and transmits measurement data concerning all RS (Russian Segment) systems, science hardware and health status parameters of crewmembers to the ground.  It provides ground specialists with insight in RS systems operations.]
 
 FE-2 also worked on the RSE1 laptop, reinstalling software (Vers. 1.4) on the primary hard drive to regain Norton AV (Antivirus) application functionality, then loaded the latest automatic virus signature file update.  The activity was supported by ground specialist tagup. 
 
 Later, Dmitri Kondratyev performed the periodic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program in the Russian VKS auxiliary (non-network) laptops RSS1, RSS2 &amp; RSK2 which are not loaded from the ground, from a special software program working with Norton AV on the FS (File Server) laptop.     [After first scanning the FS laptop, the virus database was transferred by flash-card to the other computers, which were then scanned one by one.  The networked RSK1, RSE1 &amp; RSE-Med laptops are regularly updated by automatic scanning.]
 
 Alex Kaleri had ~4 hrs set aside for major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the SM SOTR/Thermal Control System, first gathering the necessary hardware &amp; tooling, then removing both pumps (N1, N2) of the 4SPN2 replaceable pump panel in Loop 2 (KOB2).  Additionally, Sasha installed a clamp on the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of KOB2.       [The two SOTR KOB thermal loops control the removal of metabolic heat and heat emitted by working equipment; they also establish specific temperature conditions for the cabin atmosphere.  The excess heat is passed from the coolant through liquid-liquid heat exchangers (ZhZhT) into the active external thermal control system (KOKh) for subsequent radiation into open space.  Each loop contains 118 liters of "Triol" coolant fluid, i.e., water with a 30 percent solution of glycerin (to lower the freezing point to 7 degC) plus biocide and UV-light-sensitive additives to aid in leak detection.  One liter of Triol, which is nontoxic and poses no hazard to the crew, can absorb about 14 cubic cm of air.  Each of the two KOB loops is served by two nominally redundant pump panels (SPN), each equipped with two redundant replaceable electric pumps (ENA).  While in the early years of Mir and ISS the pumps were integral to the SPN panels, the more advanced current design allows them to be replaced without requiring a swap-out of an entire SPN block.] 
 
 The CDR performed the periodic CubeLab Module data collection session and transferred files of collected data to laptop for downlink.      [CubeLab is a low-cost 1-kg platform for educational projects.  It is a multipurpose research facility that interfaces small standard modules into the ERs (EXPRESS Racks).  The modules can be used within the pressurized space station environment in orbit, with a nominal length, width, and height of 100 mm and a mass of no more than 1 g.  Up to 16 CubeLab modules can be inserted into a CubeLab insert inside an ER.]
 
 Kelly also retrieved the two CSA-O<sub>2</sub> instruments (CSA-Oxygen, #1041, #1045) from the Soyuz TMA-01M/24S and calibrated them in the Lab for their weekly checkout, taking readings, then turning them off again and returning them to 24S.     [The oxygen sensors in the CSA-O<sub>2</sub>s (and CSA-CPs/CSA-Combustion Products) have exceeded their shelf life due to resupply delays.  The weekly calibration checks permit continued use of these units until new ones arrive on ULF-5.]
 
 Scott continued HTV2 cargo ops, unloading equipment and also replacing it with excessed hardware and trash for disposal.  Later, the CDR tagged up with ground specialists (~1:40pm EST) for the regular HTV cargo transfer debrief.
 
 For the upcoming ULF-5 spacewalks, Paolo Nespoli initiated charging of REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly) #1009 in the Airlock BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly).
 
 Kondratyev performed the periodic accuracy checks on six RS vacuum pressure gauges (MV).
 
 Later, FE-4 completed another ~20-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, shooting Darwin Island, plus the northernmost island, and a small island (about 1 km in diameter) in the Galapagos archipelago. 
 
 Continuing the current round of monthly preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Dmitri cleaned the TsV1 fan screen in the FGB.
 
 Working periodic maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), CDR Kelly evacuated its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.  Scott also performed the periodic inspection of the recently added rope knot of the ARED’s exercise rope for fraying or damage in the strands.
 
 FE-4 handled the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 FE-2 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
 CDR &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Cady at ~10:50am, Scott at ~12:50pm EST.
 
 At ~2:20pm, Nespoli conducted a teleconference with CSL (Crew Support Laboratory) personnel.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).
 
 No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded for today.
