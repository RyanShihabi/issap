All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
 Before breakfast and exercise, the crew performed another PHS (Periodic Health Status) w/Blood Labs examination, using the U.S. PCBA(Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer).  The second part of PHS, Subjective Clinical Evaluation, was performed later in the day.   CDR Fincke assisted with the blood draw for Sandy as CMO (Crew Medical Officer), and she assisted him in turn.  All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.     [The PHS exam, with PCBA analysis and clinical evaluation, is guided by special software (IFEP, In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC laptop.  While PCBA analyzes total blood composition, the blood's hematocrit is particularly measured by the Russian MO-10 protocol.] 
 
 FE-1 Lonchakov updated the Russian RSE2 laptop with antivirus software.
 
 After activating the JEMRMS BUC (Japanese Experiment Module/Robotic Manipulator System Backup Controller), FE-2 Magnus conducted a DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) review of upcoming robotics activities for JEMRMS Checkout No. 2.  Afterwards, the BUC was turned off again.
 
 The FE-1 took and downloaded the periodic sensor readings of the Russian “Pille-MKS” (MKS = ISS) radiation dosimetry experiment which has ten sensors placed at various locations in the Russian segment (DC1, SM starboard &amp; port cabin windows, ASU toilet facility, control panel, etc.).   [Nine of the ten dosimeters are read manually.]
 
 In preparation for Mission 15A, CDR Fincke modified the EVA Grease Gun Nozzle MLIs (Multi-Layer Insulations.
 
 Yuri Lonchakov installed and tested a new internal communications WAP (Wireless Access Point; Russian: ABP) in the SM.    [Equipment unpacked from the DC1 includes the WAP, power &amp; data cables and an Ethernet cable.  Outfitting included unstowing a third antenna and mounting it at the side of the WAP.]
 
 FE-2 Magnus terminated the overnight Kibo JPM/JLP (JEM Pressurized Logistics Segment) vestibule depressurization and leak check.
 
 Mike Fincke worked on installation, activation &amp; checkout of the new ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Devise).    [ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout consists of two days of activities.  Today, Mike configured &amp; tested the hardware utilizing uplinked procedures. Tomorrow, the ground will evaluate ARED and VIS (Vibration Isolation System) performance while the crew is exercising.]
 
 Sandy Magnus conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew's water calldowns are sent up every other week.    [The new card (18-0006I) lists 40 CWCs (~1,243.7 L total) for the four types of water identified on board: technical water (660.6 L, for Elektron electrolysis, not usable before further analysis since these bags were filled from WPA or sampled on ULF2), potable water (530.4 L, incl. 174.6 L currently off-limit because of Wautersia bacteria), condensate water (0.0 L), waste/EMU dump and other (46.7 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] 
 
 The CDR completed the daily flushing of the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser).   [The PWD had been found, via several microbial analyses by Sandy, to have bacteria growing in the ambient water.  It is suspected that this is due to the water being stagnant and not used.  The crew now performs daily flushes with 100 mL of deionized water.]
 
 Sandy Magnus performed her first standard 30-min Shuttle RPM  skill training, using the D2X digital still cameras with 400 &amp; 800mm lenses to take imagery from Windows 6 or 8 in the SM (Service Module) facing the velocity vector.    [The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle (STS-119/Discovery/15A) on 2/14.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Discovery, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
 The FE-1 completed the routine daily servicing of the SM's SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and performing US condensate processing (transfer from CWC to EDV containers) if condensate is available.]
 
 Lonchakov also performed the regular daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance task by updating/editing the IMS standard “delta file” including stowage locations for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 The station residents conducted their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR, FE-2), TVIS treadmill (FE-1), IRED/Interim Resistive Exercise Device (CDR, FE-2) and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
