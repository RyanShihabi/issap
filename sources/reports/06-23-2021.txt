Plasma Krystall-4 (PK-4): The crew executed two Run 2 operations by catching clouds of particles inside the PK-4 chamber using the PK-4 Human Computer Interface (HCI) software on the European Physiology Module (EPM) laptop. PK-4 is a scientific collaboration between ESA and Roscosmos performing research in the field of “Complex Plasmas”. Complex Plasmas are low temperature gaseous mixtures composed of ionized gas, neutral gas, and micron-sized particles. The micro-particles become highly charged in the plasma and interact strongly with each other, which can lead to a self-organized structure of the micro-particles, so-called plasma crystals. Experiments in the facility aim to study transport properties, thermodynamics, kinetics and statistical physics, non-linear waves, and instabilities in Complex Plasmas.

Robotics On-board Trainer (ROBoT) On-board Training (OBT): The crew completed a ROBoT OBT session in preparation for the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) support of the ISS Roll-Out Solar Array (IROSA) 4B Install Extravehicular Activity (EVA). The OBT involved both the Intravehicular (IV) robotic operators as well as the Extravehicular (EV) crew in order to practice EVA communication and build team awareness of the robotics related constraints.
EVA Preparations: The crew completed several activities in preparation for the IROSA 4B Install EVA. The crew printed Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) cuff checklists, terminated Metal Oxide (METOX) cartridge regenerations, and replaced the Display and Control Module (DCM) O-Ring seal on EMU 3015. Finally, the crew reviewed EVA procedures and participated in a conference with the ground. The IROSA 4B Install EVA is planned for Friday, June 25th.
