Rodent Research-17 (RR-17):  The crew installed Rodent Habitats in the Lab rack in preparation for upcoming RR-17 operations following SpX-18 arrival.  RR-17 uses younger and older mice as model organisms to evaluate the physiological, cellular and molecular effects of the spaceflight environment. Some responses to spaceflight in humans and model organisms such as mice resemble accelerated aging. This investigation provides a better understanding of aging-related immune, bone, and muscle disease processes, which may lead to new therapies for use in space and on Earth. 
ISS Emergency Hardware Familiarization: All six crew members reviewed locations of equipment and positions of valves in the USOS and RS used in emergencies. Throughout the training, the crew consulted with specialists at Mission Control Center (MCC)-Houston, MCC-Moscow, Columbus CC and Space Station Integration and Promotion Center (SSIPC).
SpX-18 Arrival Preparations: In preparation for SpX-18 arrival tomorrow, the crew completed three Capture Point Hold runs that allows practice in free drift timing, malfunction response and nominal rate approaches. They also had a conference with ground teams to discuss cargo transfer operations.
Treadmill 2 (T2): This morning the crew was informed of an “over temp caution” on T2. The crew found no signs of smoke or and no smoke detector alarms were annunciated. T2 is currently No-Go and crew will use Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabalization (CEVIS) as the standard alternate exercise method.
