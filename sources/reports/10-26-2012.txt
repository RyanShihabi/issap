ISS On-Orbit Status 10/26/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    
 
Crew sleep cycle shift:
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Wake (this morning):     4:00am EDT (2 hrs. later)
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Sleep (tonight):             5:30pm (return to normal)
 
After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops.
 
CDR Williams &amp; FE-6 Hoshide started the day with another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, Suni’s 33<sup>rd</sup>, Aki’s 34<sup>th</sup>.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Most tasks today were scheduled as Crew Handover opportunities, with the new 32S crewmembers assisting the experienced 31S crewmembers to familiarize themselves with the activities.
 
FE-4 Malenchenko started out with FE-1 Novitskiy, conducting the standard 40-min. vehicle-to-vehicle TORU test between the SM and the DC1 nadir-docked Progress 48P, closely monitored by ground personnel on DO1 via VHF at 10:03-10:26am EDT.  Progress thrusters (DPO) were inhibited and not involved.        [The TORU teleoperator system lets an SM-based crewmember perform the approach &amp; docking of automated Progress vehicles manually in case of failure of the KURS radio-based autopilot.]
 
Next, Malenchenko was joined by FE-2 Tarelkin in supported the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in the MRM1 Rassvet module by downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via RSPI (High-speed Data Transmission Radio Link).       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104], and
 
Oleg Novitskiy unloaded the DOSIS 3D (Dose Distribution Inside the ISS 3D) PDPs (Passive Detector Packs) payload from Soyuz and handed it over to Williams who installed the dosimeters in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and performed photodocumentation of the installations (2 pictures per detector).     [PDPs are exchanged regularly with even numbered Soyuz flights. Soyuz 32S brought up the second set of PDPs to be installed throughout the Columbus module.  Background: The goal of the DOSIS 3D experiment is to determine the absorbed dose and dose-equivalent using active &amp; passive radiation detector devices distributed throughout the ISS. To obtain the dose distribution in three dimensions (3D), DOSIS 3D aims to combine data acquired by ESA with complementary data from radiation detectors operated by JAXA, NASA and Roskosmos/IBMP. The DOSIS 3D experiment has been running since its launch with Soyuz 30S in May 2012. The experiment consists of two types of radiation detectors, active and passive. Integral measurements, which deliver data about the absorbed dose, LET spectra and dose equivalent, are provided by passive radiation detectors. Temporal variations of the LET spectra, charge distribution spectra and the dose equivalent are furnished by active radiation detectors (two DOSTEL {DOSimetry TELescopes} located inside the Dosis Main Box). Based on the combined output from all these passive &amp; active radiation detectors, an interactive database will be constructed to serve the scientific community, holding essential information for the application of radiation protection standards for manned spaceflight and for any radiation-sensitive experiment in space.]
 
FE-6 Hoshide completed routine maintenance on the WRS (Water Recovery System) using the LFTP (Low Flow Transfer Pump) to transfer water from CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine) to the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) and offloading it, using a particulate filter.     [Estimated offload time (i.e., spacing between initiation &amp; termination): ~4:30 hrs.]
 
Afterwards, Akihiko completed the standard 30-day inspection of the AED (Automated External Defibrillator) in the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) rack, with FE-3 Kevin Ford joining in for familiarization.    [AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient.  It then can treat them through defibrillation, i.e., the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.]
 
Sunita &amp; Akihiko prepared themselves for upcoming Dragon cold stowage operations by reviewing DCB (Double Cold Bag) packing procedures.     [Suni &amp; Aki will have to pack 5 DCBs with IceBricks and samples, removed from MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) and MELFI-2, for return on Dragon 1.]
 
The CDR powered off and stowed the ESA METERON (Multi-purpose End-To-End Robotic Operations Network) laptop which she used for the successful OPSCOM-1 (Operations &amp; Communications Test Part 1) session, with DTN (Delay Tolerant Networking) DVD, HHD (Hard Disk Drive) and battery left installed in the laptop.
 
Afterwards, Suni continued the new Dragon-delivered experiment Micro-6 (Genotypic &amp; Phenotypic Responses of Candida albicans to Spaceflight), today terminating &amp; transferring the 2<sup>nd</sup> Group.      [Steps included accessing CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5), removing &amp; terminating all Micro-6 GAPs (Group Activation Packs), then accessing CGBA-4 and transferring/inserting GAPs F,G,H,N into CGBA-4, followed by removal of GAPs E,J,K,L,M from CGBA-4 and their transfer to CGBA-1. Micro-6 GAPs D,E,I,J,K,L,M,O were then installed into CGBA-1.  Background: Fundamental space biology experiments address basic questions of how life responds to gravity and space environments. The experiments probe the fundamental nature of life in order to enhance our understanding of how life responds to physical phenomena and physical forces on Earth and serve as the basic biological foundation in support of exploration. In particular, Micro-6 studies how microgravity affects the health risk posed by the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans. In our bodies, yeasts, especially the yeast Candida albicans help us maintain a healthy personal ecosystem. However, when our immune systems are stressed, Candida albicans can grow out of control. When that happens, yeast become so numerous that infections can result in the mouth, throat, intestines, and genitor-urinary tract. The equipment consists of GAPs stored in a flight-certified incubator at a temperature of 4 degrees centigrade. Each GAP contains eight FPAs (Fluid Processing Apparatuses) shaped like test tubes but designed to meet the unique requirement of mixing fluids in microgravity. Each FPA contains an isolated amount of the microbial culture of Candida, plus a growth medium and a termination reagent or fixative. During the three-week flight aboard the ISS, a crew member begins the experiment by increasing the incubator temperature to 30 degrees centigrade, and then activate the FPAs by pushing the plunger to mix the Candida with a growth medium. After 24 or 50 hours depending on the sample, the experiment will be terminated by pushing the plunger deeper into the FPA which combines a fixative agent to effectively stop the growth of the yeast cultures.]
 
After yesterday’s arrival of JAXA’s MOST (Medaka Osteoclast [killifish]) school of fish and removal of air bubbles from AQH (Aquatic Habitat) Aquariums 1 &amp; 2, FE-6 Hoshide today tested the AQH’s water quality by measuring the concentration of ammonium, nitrate and nitrite in the water with nitrate &amp; nitrite test strips removed from MELFI-3 Dewar 4.  The test strips were then returned to MELFI-3.      [The testing was to be finished within 1 hr from water sampling.]
 
Kevin Ford unpacked the new IMAKs (ISS Medical Accessory Kits) delivered on 32P and moved them to stowage.
 
Later, Kevin reviewed background and procedures for the ELITE-S2 (ELaboratore Immagini TElevisive - Space 2) set up by Aki in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) on 10/15, then conducted a teleconference at ~1:35pm with ground specialists to discuss the experiment.
 
Oleg Novitskiy worked in the Orbital Module (BO) of the Soyuz 32S spacecraft, installing and connecting the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its TA765B/PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit from SM stowage, recycled from an earlier vehicle.
 
Later, Oleg &amp; Evgeny had several hours set aside for unloading the 32S spacecraft and transferring cargo to ISS, logging moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System) database.
 
Akihiko joined with Suni for another 45-min self-study OBT (Onboard Training) session of Dragon departure procedures and details, followed by a 15-min teleconference with the ground at ~1:00pm.
 
Aki also had ~40 min allotted for prepacking return-to-Earth cargo for SpX-1 Dragon.  Afterwards, at ~1:55pm, he conducted a phone tagup with ground personnel to report on stowage status.
 
Malenchenko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Yuri also took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Working with Kevin for familiarization/handover, Aki Hoshide performed periodic maintenance on the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) by cleaning &amp; lubricating its beverage adapter to restore functionality.
 
At ~10:55am, all six crewmembers teamed up for the standard one-hour Crew Emergency Roles &amp; Responsibilities Review (peredacha smeniy po bezopasnosti), to familiarize themselves with emergency roles &amp; responsibilities as a 6-person crew, including escape routes.   Later, the crew had a ~20 min tagup with ground specialists to discuss particulars.        [Baseline emergency response actions are covered in the EMER-1 book.  Emergencies may arise due to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) leak, non-ammonia toxic spills, fire or rapid depressurization.  In the event that a member of the 32S crew becomes incapacitated during such an emergency response, the whole crew will stop response procedures and return to their Soyuz spacecraft.  The more experienced 31S crew may, after conferring with the ISS CDR, egress their Soyuz and finish the response in this case.]
 
The three Russian crewmembers, Yuri, Oleg &amp; Evgeny, had 1.5 hrs scheduled each on their timeline for joint handover activities, led by Yuri.
 
Sunita &amp; Kevin also spent ~1h40m on handovers, led by Suni.
 
FE-3 Ford was scheduled to perform his daily task of filling out his Space Headache questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) since yesterday for his first week in space.  He also is to take photos of the two questionnaires from his time on Soyuz and downlink them to the ground.
 
Novitskiy, Tarelkin &amp; Ford had their standard post-launch PMCs (Private Medical Conferences, via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Evgeny at ~6:55am, Oleg at ~8:00am, Kevin at ~9:40am EDT.
 
The newly arrived Soyuz 32S crewmembers also had about an hour of free time each for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
At ~6:25am EDT, Malenchenko, Novitskiy, Tarelkin, Williams, Ford &amp; Hoshide held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Main Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
At ~6:40am, Yuri &amp; Oleg linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
At ~1:15pm, Sunita Williams conducted the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
At ~1:35pm EDT, Suni powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and conducted a ham radio session with students at East Falmouth Elementary School, East Falmouth, MA.
 
At ~3:05pm, the crew held their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston.
 
The CDR had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in her electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
Before Presleep (~3:40pm), Williams will power up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4/2x) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6).      [CDR &amp; FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today shows no exercise, with ARED/T2 (continuous), T2 (interval, 2 min.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), EVA, and T2 (int., 4 min.) for the next 7 days. Aki’s protocol for today showed T2 (int., 2 min.), with ARED/T2 (cont.), T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 4 min.), ARED/CEVIS, EVA and no exercise on the following 7 days.]
