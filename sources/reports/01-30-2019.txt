Kubik: Today a crewmember upgraded hardware for the Kubik-6 unit. Kubik is a small controlled-temperature incubator or cooler with removable inserts designed for self-contained, automatic microgravity experiments such as those using seeds, cells, and small animals.
NanoRacks External Cygnus CubeSat Deployer (NRCSD): Today a crewmember installed NRCSD-15 deployer with the 5 planned cubesats onto the Multipurpose Experiment Platform (MPEP) located on the JEM Airlock slide table. CubeSat deployments are planned to occur tomorrow morning. The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer is a stackable, modular, ground loaded launch case. Each NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer accommodates up to 6.5U and eight launch cases are stacked for each JEM Airlock opening. The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer meets the growing demand to deploy CubeSat format satellites from the ISS for a variety of customers. 
Bio-Monitor: Today a crewmember doffed the spare Bio-Monitor wearable hardware and stowed the hardware completing a 48-hour data gathering session. Although the ISS is equipped with health and life sciences research tools, the existing instrumentation for continuous and simultaneous recording of several physiological parameters is lacking. To tackle this issue, the Bio-Monitor Commissioning activity tests the Bio-Monitor facility; a wearable garment capable of monitoring relevant physiological parameters for up to 48 hours in a non-invasive and non-interfering way.
Circadian Rhythms: Today a crewmember donned on the Circadian Rhythms hardware to begin a 36-hour recording session. Circadian Rhythms investigates the role of synchronized circadian rhythms, or the “biological clock,” and how it changes during long-duration spaceflight. Researchers hypothesize that a non-24-hour cycle of light and dark affects crewmembers’ circadian clocks. 
Node 3 Intermodule Ventilation (IMV) Cleaning: Flow measurements taken in October identified reduced air flow to the Cupola from Node 3. Today as part of routine maintenance, the crew cleaned the Node 3 deck IMV starboard fan inlet flow straighteners, inlet silencer, and outlet silencer.
