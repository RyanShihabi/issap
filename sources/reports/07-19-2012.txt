ISS On-Orbit Status 07/19/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     &gt;&gt;&gt;With currently 403.2 km average altitude, the ISS is flying higher than ever before in its history.  Even higher is the apogee of its orbit �C 408.5 km.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
At wakeup, Sergei Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Gennady Padalka started the day by setting up the FSS Photo Spectrum System at an SM window to observe &amp; photograph the flooding area in the Russian Kuban region, to obtain additional data on contamination and degree of natural destruction caused by catastrophic flooding in Krymsk area.     [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module.]
 
FE-3 Acaba retrieved &amp; stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies which he had deployed on 7/17 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.       [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
CDR Padalka completed his 3<sup>rd</sup> with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.      [Revin provided assistance in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit, and Sergei also took documentary photography.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
In preparation for Progress 47P undocking (7/22), Gennady &amp; Yuri Malenchenko installed the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC1 nadir port.      [The StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM (Service Module), FGB, MRM2 and DC1.]
 
Also as a pre-undocking activity, Malenchenko de-installed and removed the two ruchek handles on the external side of the 47P hatch.
 
FE-2 Revin had another hour for Progress 47P trash stowage operations, supported by the IMS (Inventory Management System).
 
After inspecting and then activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility (later deactivating it), FE-5 Sunita Williams adjusted the video camera and conducted another session with the BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids) experiment by conducting a single flame test run on a sample, and performing a fan calibration to evaluate the air flow with the new fan flow constrictor installed.        [BASS uses SLICE equipment but burns solid fuel samples instead of gaseous jets.  Sample will either be ignited one time and then replaced with a new one, or burn multiple times.  The four servicing procedures, ops prep, BASS ops, BASS fan calibration &amp; BASS videotape exchange, are now no longer listed separately on the crew timeline but consolidated in one activity.  BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity.  It will also guide strategies for extinguishing accidental fires in micro-G.  Results will contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in space and on Earth.]
 
With Lab window shutters closed and the CCR (Cupola Crew Restraint) installed at the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation), Joe Acaba &amp; Aki Hoshide performed another grapple training session with the MSS (Mobile Servicing System) ROBoT system for the HTV-3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle) capture and berthing, supported by ground specialist teleconferences at ~7:50am.  Afterwards, the CCR was taken down again, the CUP RWS UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) was disabled and the Lab RWS DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) power was turned off. 
 
FE-4 Malenchenko had another hour on his schedule for unloading the 31S spacecraft and transferring equipment to the ISS for stowage, guided by the IMS.
 
Sergei Revin continued the standard windows inspection and photography, today in the DC1 on the VL1 EVA hatch window and in MRM2 on the VL2 window.         [Objective of the inspection, which uses a digital still camera (Nikon D2X w/SB-28DX flash) and voice recorder, is to assess the pane surfaces on RS for any changes (new cavities, scratches, new or expanded old stains or discolorations affecting transparency properties) since the last inspection.  The new assessment will be compared to the earlier observations.  Defects are measured with the parallax method which uses eyeball-sighting with a ruler and a right isosceles triangle to determine the defects' size and position with respect to the window's internal surface (parallax being the apparent change in an object's position resulting from changing the observer's position).]
 
Working in the Node-3 WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), FE-3 Acaba &amp; FE-6 Hoshide (as handover activity) performed the periodic removal &amp; replacement of the E-K pre-treat tank and its hose, discarding the used units as trash and restowing the tools.      [E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid), CrO<sub>3</sub> (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H<sub>2</sub>O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.]
 
Joe also completed another weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.        [The current card (32-0027A) lists 13 CWCs (203.1 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (4 CWCs with 133.6 L);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (3 CWCs with 55.5 L); and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.] 
 
Afterwards, FE-3 undertook the monthly inspection of the T2/COLBERT treadmill system and its components, checking pin alignment, rack centering and the snubber jam nut witness marks.     [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- &amp; Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm.  Their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.]
 
Acaba also unstowed the Pro K pH kit and prepositioned it with controlled diet menu items and daily consumables in preparation for his upcoming 2<sup>nd</sup> (FD30) Pro K Controlled Diet activity, starting tomorrow with the first pH test and diet log entry.       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.]
 
Yuri Malenchenko made his way into the SA/Descent Module of the newly arrived Soyuz TMA-05M/31S spacecraft and dismantled its two "Klest" (KL-152) TV cameras and their SG2-14V light units for return to the ground on Soyuz 30S for reuse, temporarily stowing them in the SM.
 
Revin performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Sergei also took care of the daily IMS maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
All six crewmembers teamed up for the standard one-hour Crew Emergency Roles &amp; Responsibilities Review (peredacha smeniy po bezopasnosti), to familiarize themselves with emergency roles &amp; responsibilities as a 6-person crew, including escape routes.   Later, the crew had a ~20 min tagup with ground specialists to discuss particulars.        [Baseline emergency response actions are covered in the EMER-1 book.  Emergencies may arise due to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) leak, non-ammonia toxic spills, fire or rapid depressurization.  In the event that a member of the 31S crew becomes incapacitated during such an emergency response, the whole crew will stop response procedures and return to their Soyuz spacecraft.  The 30S crew may, after conferring with the ISS CDR, egress their Soyuz and finish the response in this case.]
 
Padalka &amp; Malenchenko conducted the standard 30-min intermodular space-to-space (wireless) test of the TORU teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system, i.e., between the TORU control station in the SM and Progress 47P (#415), docked at DC1 nadir.  Progress DPO (Approach &amp; Attitude Control) thrusters were not commanded.  The test was performed on DO1 at 1:00pm-1:35pm EDT.     [TORU is the manually teleoperated backup approach and docking system for the automated Progress ships.] 
 
Acaba opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment and activated the ISSAC laptop, so ground images can be captured by ground commanding.       [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
Later, Joe completed his weekly task of filling out the SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch on a daily basis and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space.
 
Gennady removed the SSD305 (A96) light fixture in 47P for stowage in SM as a spare.
 
Sunita reviewed reference material on the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) assessment protocols, brushing up for her first Ambulatory Monitoring session tomorrow.        [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist &amp; ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Pettit started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.]
 
Joe Acaba &amp; Sunita Williams had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
Before Presleep, FE-3 will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
Before sleeptime, Yuri Malenchenko will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his first session with the Sonokard experiment, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
The 31S crew Malenchenko, Williams &amp; Hoshide had another hour of free time each for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
At ~8:20am, Aki Hoshide supported a JAXA PAO TV event with the Tanegashima Board and the “Minami-nihon”.
 
At ~10:00am, the six crewmembers joined up for the weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office/CB (Peggy Whitson), via S-band S/G-2 audio &amp; phone patch.
 
At ~1:20pm EDT, Akihiko had a post-launch PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
At ~2:25pm, Joe conducted the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
FE-5 Williams re-familiarized herself with the CEVIS exercise device by watching Acaba using it.
 
Both Suni &amp; Aki prepared for CEVIS use by inserting their CEVIS USB sticks into an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for protocol uplink from the ground.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4). 
 
Tasks listed for Revin &amp; Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).</li></ul> 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Yerevan, Armenia (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  ISS had a late-morning pass in fair weather for this target.  The Armenian capital of just over 1 million is located in a major agricultural valley between Lake Sevan and Mount Ararat.  At this time, as ISS approached from the NW, the crew was to look just right of track for this urban area on the north side of the valley), Bern, Switzerland (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  The Swiss federal capital lies in the rolling plateau region north of the Alps and northeast of Lake Geneva.  ISS had a mid-morning pass approaching from the NW in fair weather.  At this time the crew was to begin looking near nadir for this small city of about 125,000 in the valley of the Aare River), San Marino, San Marino (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  ISS had a mid-morning pass in clear weather over the target area with the tiny capital city of this microstate just right of track.  At this time as the crew approached the coast of the northwestern Adriatic Sea, they were to begin a mapping strip to acquire useful views that they probably were not be able to distinguish for themselves.  The Republic itself is land-locked and is located about 20 miles southwest of the Italian coastal city of Rimini.  Best visual cues are Rimini's small but prominent bay and a light-toned river which reaches the sea at this point), Tirane, Albania (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  The Albanian capital of about 740,000 lies just inland from the Adriatic Sea.  ISS had a late morning, nadir pass for this target.  At this time as the crew approached the coast from the NW, they were to look for this urban area and try for a tighter view than this recent photo), Brazzaville, Kinshasa, Congo (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION SITE:  A rare break in the usual heavy cloud cover is expected at the time of this pass over these two capital cities located on either side of the Congo River.  Brazzaville is the capital of Republic of the Congo, while Kinshasa is the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   At this time as ISS approached from the NW in early afternoon, the crew was to try for context views centered on each city), and Coast Mountains, BC, Canada (ISS had a fine, mid-morning pass in fair weather over these beautiful snowcapped mountains rising above the forests of western British Columbia.  The glaciers here have been in a well-documented, heavy retreat for the past couple of decades even though they are located in a moist, marine environment, with heavy winter snowfalls and elevations ranging from 10,000 to 13,000 feet.  At this time good views of three major ice fields and glacier areas of the mountains lied just left of track).
