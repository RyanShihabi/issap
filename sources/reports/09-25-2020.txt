Astrobee off: Following the completion of the data downlink from the Robo-Pro rehearsal yesterday, Astrobee was powered off.  Astrobee is made up of three free-flying, cube-shaped robots which are designed to help scientists and engineers develop and test technologies for use in microgravity to assist astronauts with routine chores, and give ground controllers additional eyes and ears on the space station. The autonomous robots, powered by fans and vision-based navigation, perform crew monitoring, sampling, logistics management, and accommodate up to three investigations.
MELFI dewar clean: The crew re-installed the cleaned and dried MELFI2 stowage trays.  This helps prepare for future icebrick or science sample storage in this area.  Icebricks are used to provide thermal mass while in MELFI, and maintain temperatures via phase-change cooling for samples returning to the ground in passive stowage.  The Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) is a cold storage unit that maintains experiment samples at cold temperatures (+2 deg C to -95 deg C) throughout a mission.
Systems
ISS Leak Detection Operations: On Thursday, the crew used the Ultrasonic Leak Detector (ULD) to inspect for air leaks at the JEM windows, SM Windows #1 and #12, and DC1 EV hatch window #2. Ground teams have scheduled a second isolation test over the weekend that includes 4 hours of ULD testing.
Environmental Health System (EHS) Coliform Water Sample Analysis: Today the crew completed post processing analysis of the coliform detection bags. The water samples were acquired on GMT 267 and allowed to incubate to check for the presence of Coliform bacteria. Following the incubation period, the crew visually analyzed the coliform detection bags and recorded the results. Visual confirmation must be performed within 40-48 hours of the initial sample collection.
