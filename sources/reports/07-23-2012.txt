ISS On-Orbit Status 07/23/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway:  Week 4 of Increment 32 (six-person crew).
 
For today and tomorrow, the crew has been split in two shifts, for the first time, in order to provide support to the Progress M-15M/47P undocking/redocking/undocking sequence:  
 
Crew 1 (Padalka, Revin, Malenchenko):
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Wake1 –  2:00am EDT (this morning)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Sleep1 –  11:00am (today) </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Wake2 –  4:30pm (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Sleep2 – 11:30pm (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Wake3 – 9:00am (tomorrow)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Sleep3 – 5:30pm (tomorrow)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Wake4 – 2:00am (Wednesday) – returning to nominal.</li></ul> 
Crew 2 (Acaba, Williams, Hoshide):
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Wake1 –  2:00am EDT (this morning)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Sleep1 –  5:30pm (today) </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Wake2 –  8:45pm (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Observe 47P Re-dock – 8:45pm-10:15pm (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Sleep2 – 10:15pm (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Wake3 – 3:30am (tomorrow)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Sleep3 – 5:30pm (tomorrow)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Wake4 – 2:00am (Wednesday) – returning to nominal.</li></ul> 
At wakeup, Sergei Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  FE-2 also conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
Acaba had Day 4 of his 2<sup>nd</sup> (FD30) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording his diet input today, Joe broke out the equipment for the associated urine collections for pH value, beginning tomorrow, followed by the blood sampling tomorrow.      [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15<sup>th</sup> day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 &amp; 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
FE-6 Hoshide had Day 2 of his first (FD15) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording his diet input today, Akihiko will begin the urine collections for pH value on Wednesday (7/25) and blood sampling on Thursday (7/26).
 
Gennady Padalka took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Other activities performed by the CDR before his early sleeptime (11:00am EDT) were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;text-align:justify;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Assisting Yuri Malenchenko with his first MBI-28 Xromatomass (Chromatomass) Spectrometry experiment with analysis of saliva &amp; blood samples, by taking documentary photography, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;text-align:justify;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Performing standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in the MRM1 Rassvet, downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the Soyuz docking to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA;   [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104].</li></ul> 
In preparation for the re-docking of Progress M-15M/47P (#415) at the DC1 port after the test of its new Kurs-NA antenna (tonight at ~9:58pm EDT), Malenchenko &amp; Padalka worked through the standard 3-hr refresher training for the TORU teleoperator system, which provides a manual backup mode to the Progress’ KURS automated rendezvous radar system.        [The drill included procedure review, rendezvous, docking data and rendezvous math modeling data review, fly-around, final approach, docking and off-nominal situations (e.g., video or comm loss).  Three different flight conditions were simulated on the RSK1 laptop.  The TORU teleoperator control system lets a SM-based crewmember perform the approach and docking of automated Progress vehicles in case of KURS failure.  During spacecraft approach, TORU is in “hot standby” mode.  Receiving a video image of the approaching ISS, as seen from a Progress-mounted docking television camera (“Klest”), on a color monitor (“Simvol-Ts”, i.e. “symbol center”) which also displays an overlay of rendezvous data from the onboard digital computer, the crewmember would steer the Progress to mechanical contact by means of two hand controllers, one for rotation (RUO), the other for translation (RUD), on adjustable armrests.  The controller-generated commands are transmitted from the SM's TORU control panel to the Progress via VHF radio.  In addition to the Simvol-Ts color monitor, range, range rate (approach velocity) and relative angular position data are displayed on the “Klest-M” video monitor (VKU) which starts picking up signals from Progress when it is still approximately 9 km away.  TORU is monitored in real time from TsUP over RGS (Russian Ground Sites) and via Ku-band from Houston, but its control cannot be taken over from the ground.]
 
During his first work period (2:00 am-11:00am), Sergei Revin started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the SM for about 2h30m for cleaning its numerous Group A ventilator fans &amp; grilles.
 
Afterwards, FE-2 undertook his 3<sup>rd</sup> regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas, The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics.  At the end, Revin completed a self-assessment questionnaire.  Answers were provided at test conclusion.       [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.]
 
Sergei also completed the routine daily &amp; weekly servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.     [This included the weekly collection of the ASU toilet flush counter (SPKU) and water supply (SVO) readings of SM &amp; FGB for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers as required.]
 
During his workday (2:00am-5:30pm), FE-3 Acaba opened the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola &amp; Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows after the docking, and later closing them again in preparation for the Progress re-docking.
 
Later, Joe performed regular extended maintenance on the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), changing out its UR (Urine Receptacle) hose, IF (Insert Filter) plus the LI (Liquid Indicator) with associated air hoses, then vacuumed the entire WHC and cleaned it with disinfectant wipes and Braycote-601 lubricant.   [The old items were double-bagged and stowed for disposal.]
 
FE-6 Hoshide &amp; FE-3 Acaba had another ~50-min set aside for an OBT (Onboard Training) session with the ROBoT simulator equipment to rehearse activities for the upcoming (7/27) rendezvous &amp; docking of the Japanese HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3).       [This is the last of three ROBoT sessions in prep for HTV.  It includes two Capture Point Hold runs and various quick-turnaround cases including malfunctions using the Auto Run tool.  Objectives:<a name="_1310956870"></a><a name="_1310956951"></a>  Practice good hand controller techniques; review capture operations specific to HTV3; practice M1/M2 communication and coordination, and practice malfunction response.]
 
FE-5 Williams began another round of acoustic dosimeter operations, setting the dosimeters up for static measurements for approximately 12 hrs in specific locations, after changing their batteries and turning them back on.
 
Afterwards, Sunita visually inspected and activated the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility (later deactivating it), adjusted the video camera and then started another session with the BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids) experiment, conducting multiple flame test runs on samples, exchanging burner tubes between each test point, exchanging the digital tapes in the MSG VTR1 (Video Tape Recorder 1) &amp; VTR2 and at the end performing a fan calibration to evaluate the air flow with the new fan flow constrictor installed.        [BASS uses SLICE equipment but burns solid fuel samples instead of gaseous jets.  Sample will either be ignited one time and then replaced with a new one, or burn multiple times.  The four servicing procedures, ops prep, BASS ops, BASS fan calibration &amp; BASS videotape exchange, are now no longer listed separately on the crew timeline but consolidated in one activity.  BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity.  It will also guide strategies for extinguishing accidental fires in micro-G.  Results will contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in space and on Earth.]
 
In preparation for her upcoming first ESA Ultrasound VI (Vessel Imaging) session, Sunita Williams reviewed briefing material, refreshing herself on Echography operational procedures, VI inflight remote guidance echo protocol, etc.
 
At ~4:15am EDT, FE-6 Hoshide held the regular weekly crew conference with SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center/Tsukuba) staff.
 
Afterwards, Akihiko unstowed and checked out the onboard components of the Japanese DK (Diagnostic Kit), i.e., Pulse Oximeter, Electronic Stethoscope and Sleep Monitor.      [DK will involve oxygen level measurements, recording overnight brainwaves during sleep, Cardiograph measurements &amp; Heart Sound recordings.  Purpose of these activities is to perform diagnostic measurements with medical equipment in order to evaluate the equipment for development of a future diagnostic system on board.] 
 
Working on the ARED advanced resistive exercise machine, Hoshide &amp; Williams replaced the device’s exercise rope with a new one.
 
Williams &amp; Hoshide each had time reserved for reviewing ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) reference material and study the constraints for the human research experiments awaiting them at future dates.     [The goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  Each experiment session consists of two separate but related activities over a 1 week time period:  an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions will be scheduled at or around FD14 (Flight Day 14), FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15. The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.]
 
FE-6 went on a search to locate a missing CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag), #1020.
 
Aki also broke out and set up the equipment for his first ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, scheduled tomorrow.
 
Sunita &amp; Aki Joe had another hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
Sleeptime 1 for Acaba, Williams &amp; Hoshide begins at 5:30pm and ends at 8:45pm tonight, to support Progress 47P redocking activities by observing the spacecraft’s automated approach &amp; docking (around 9:55pm), with Padalka &amp; Malenchenko standing by at the TORU teleoperator radio system to take over in case of need.  Sleep for Joe, Sunita &amp; Akihiko will then resume at ~10:15pm, to extend until ~3:30am tomorrow morning.
 
Having had their sleep/rest time since 11:00am this morning, Padalka, Revin &amp; Malenchenko will resume work later today at ~4:30pm, until next sleeptime at 11:30pm, extending to 9:00am tomorrow (Tuesday).
 
During these 7 hrs, their attention will focus primarily on Progress redock operations:
 
For covering the re-docking, Gennady will activate and test the Ku-band video “scheme” for converting (encoding) the RS video signal from the Sony HVR-Z7E camera and external Klest Kl-154 “+X” camera to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band from SM, to downlink “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.  For the checkout of the MPEG-2 coder, the CDR runs a streaming test from the RSS1 laptop and monitors the transmission of the docking coverage to the ground.        [The image is monitored on the SSC-1 (Station Support Computer 1) at the SM CP (Central Post).  Using the NASA MPEG2 VIEWER and ESA MPEG2 ENCODR software, the SSC provides both decoding (viewing) and encoding (converting) during the operation.]
 
Next, Padalka &amp; Malenchenko will ready the TORU system in the SM and then, along with Acaba, Williams &amp; Hoshide, closely monitor the approach and docking of the unmanned cargo ship on its 2<sup>nd</sup> linkup, designed for an operational test of the new non-retractable KURS-NA antenna on the spacecraft.
 
The entire crew then begins their 2<sup>nd</sup> sleeptime, to extend until ~3:30am for Crew 1 (Joe, Sunita, Aki) and to 9:00am for Crew 3 (Gennady, Sergei, Yuri). 
 
At ~9:20am, Sunita powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 9:25am conducted a ham radio session with Women in Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, NY.
 
At ~6:35pm, the three Russian crewmembers will use the SM’s amateur/ham radio equipment to conduct a ham radio session with participants of the 2<sup>nd</sup> International Youth Industrial forum “Future Engineers 2012” on the Lake Baikal shore near Irkutsk.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). 
 
Tasks listed for Revin &amp; Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">EKON Earth photography of the current flooding conditions in Russia’s Kuban region, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos &amp; videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).</li></ul> 
Progress 47P Redocking:   All activities are on schedule for the (first) 47P redock.  In order to perform a KURS-NA test, 47P undocked last night from ISS at ~4:26pm EDT, conducts the test &amp; redocks today at ~9:58pm.  2<sup>nd</sup> undock &amp; separation is on 7/30 at ~2:11pm.
 
WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (32-0027B) lists 13 CWCs (184.5 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (3 CWCs with 115 L, plus 1 empty bag);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (3 CWCs with 55.5 L); and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
