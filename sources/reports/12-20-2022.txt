Veg-05: The crew checked on the plant pillows, added water as necessary, and performed a wick opening on the plant pillows. The wick opening allows the seeds to be assessed for germination and gives them more room to grow during the 100+ day growth cycle. The Veg-05 investigation is the next step in efforts to address the need for a continuous fresh-food production system in space. A healthy, nutritious diet is essential for long-duration exploration missions, which means that the typical pre-packaged astronaut diet may need to be supplemented by fresh foods during flight. The Veggie Vegetable Production System (Veggie) has begun testing aboard the ISS to help meet this need, and leafy greens have successfully been grown in spaceflight. The research of Veg-05 expands crop variety to dwarf tomatoes and focuses on the impact of light quality and fertilizer on fruit production, microbial food safety, nutritional value, taste acceptability by the crew, and the overall behavioral health benefits of having plants and fresh food in space.

USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation Activities: In preparation for the tomorrowâ€™s 4A ISS Roll Out Solar Array (IRSOA) Install EVA, the crew completed tool configuring, tool audit, EVA battery operations, and equipment lock preparations. The crew then reviewed all detailed procedures and reference packages before finally participating in a conference with ground teams to further discuss final operations, get ahead tasks, and the EVA timeline. During this EVA, the crew will install an IROSA to the 4A power channel on the port truss of the ISS in order to generate more power to the ISS.
