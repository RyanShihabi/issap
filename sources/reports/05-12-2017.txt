EXPRESS Pallet Controller Assembly (ExPCA) Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #42: EV1 Peggy Whitson and EV2 Jack Fischer performed the ExPCA EVA today. At the start of In-Suit Light Exercise (ISLE) Prebreathe, a water leak was discovered at the Service Cooling Umbilical (SCU) for Fischer’s suit.  The leaking SCU was subsequently disconnected and the functioning SCU was shared between the two EMU suits which impacted EMU battery capability, resulting in the EVA being shortened to 4 hours 12 minutes. During that time, the following tasks were completed: 
Planned Tasks

ExPCA R&R
Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA) 3 forward shield install
Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) 1553 terminator install
Secure Multilayer Insulation (MLI) on Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS)

Get-ahead Task

COL Articulating Portable Foot Restraint (APFR) relocation to PMA3

Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) in support of today’s EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments to Space Station (ExPRESS) Carrier Avionics (ExPCA) EVA. IVA Crew Pesquet maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) into position, then EV2 Fisher installed the Articulating Portable Foot Restraint (APFR) on the SSRMS Latching End Effector (LEE) and ingressed it. Pesquet then maneuvered the SSRMS for EV2 to remove and replace the failed ExPCA on the Express Logistics Carrier #4 (ELC-4) with the spare ExPCA. When the failed ExPCA was stowed, Pesquet maneuvered the SSRMS to position EV2 for APFR egress, then Pesquet backed the SSRMS to a park position.
