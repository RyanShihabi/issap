ISS On-Orbit Status 05/18/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FD5 (Flight Day 5) of STS-132/ULF-4.
 
 ISS Crew Wake – 2:50am EDT
 ISS Crew Sleep – 6:20pm
 
 The Russian-built MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet (Dawn) was transferred from the Atlantis cargo bay to the ISS and berthed to the FGB “Zarya” (Sunrise) nadir port without hitch.  
 The successful transfer was handled by Shuttle crewmembers:
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 54pt; "> <li>CDR Ken Ham &amp; PLT Tony Antonelli, at the controls of the SRMS (Shuttle Remote Manipulator System), grappled and unberthed the MRM1 in the payload bay at ~5:51am EDT, then transferred it to the Park position;</li><li>With MS-4 Piers Sellers &amp; MS-1 Garrett Reisman operating the SSRMS (Space Station RMS), MRM1 was handed over from SRMS to SSRMS and then moved to the FGB nadir port to Predock position;</li><li>Docking activities were closely monitored by CDR Kotov from the Cupola and by FE-1 Skvortsov from the SM (Service Module) via streaming video on the “Simvol-Ts” TsVKU color monitor;</li><li>Extension of the MRM1 docking probe was complete at 7:49pm, followed by</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 54pt; "> <li>“Rassvet” berthing and installing at the FGB nadir port shortly thereafter, with all hooks driven and latches &amp; probe retracted.    [Like all the other Russian spacecraft, MRM1 used the "classic" StM probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the MRM1, while the PSA sits on the docking port of the FGB (and MRM2, SM and DC-1).]</li></ul> 
 Before MRM1 transfer, FE-6 Creamer configured the SSC-1 A31p laptop in the FGB and activated the VWS/SSC-1 (Video Streaming Workstation/Station Support Computer) laptops, followed by Skvortsov running the standard test of the RS analog video conversion “scheme” for transmitting RS (Russian Segment) analog signals by streaming video via US Ku-band assets.    [After the berthing, TJ powered the video system off again.]
 
 For the docking, a Russian laptop was configured in the USOS (US Segment).    [Oleg &amp; Alexander set up the remote RS work station in the Node-3 Cupola by connecting its hatch drag-through cable between Node-3 &amp; Node-1 and then conducted a test of the command capability of the configuration.]
 
  Subsequently, the CDR followed the SRMS/SSRMS robotarm and MRM1 berthing maneuvers from the Cupola remote RS station, afterwards taking down the OpsLAN cable between Node-1 &amp; Node-3 again while FE-1 deactivated the BRTK TVS video equipment with the “Simvol-Ts” TsVKU in the SM.
 
 Also after the berthing, Skvortsov performed the regular status check of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment hardware, copied BUSD (Control &amp; Data Gathering Unit) archive data to a USB-Flash stick, cleared the archive, adjusted the BUSD clock and downlinked the data via OCA.  IZGIB was then restarted.
 
 As part of post-berthing activities, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson re-configured the C&amp;T (Command &amp; Tracking) video set-up in Node-2, installing the video cap which enables pass-through reception of video from the Atlantis with the Orbiter docked in support of SSRMS ops.
 
 At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime this morning, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-1 Skvortsov did the daily morning check on the TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat container and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
 In the US A/L (Airlock), FE-2 terminated recharge of the EHIP (EVA Helmet Interchangeable Portable) light, PGT (Pistol Grip Tool) &amp; REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly) batteries from EVA-1 in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly) and initiated the process on a new batch including the two EMU batteries (#2078, #2085).     [More to follow tomorrow and on Thursday.]
 
 Tracy also started another sampling run (the 95<sup>th</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 Next, FE-2 did the periodic maintenance &amp; visual inspection of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), checking out the rails &amp; rollers, greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails &amp; rollers and evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.
 
 FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.
 
 Misha also conducted an audit/inventory of SOSB Solar Array Orientation System (SA) instruments in the FGB, to be used as spares in the SM.
 
 For return to the ground on STS-132, FE-5 Noguchi collected ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) coolant samples from the Node-2 LTL &amp; MTL (Low Temperature Loop &amp; Moderate Temperature Loop), and of the ITCS LTL in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).    [Node-3 samples were collected on 5/15.]
 
 Later, Soichi also collected air samples with the GSC (Grab Sample Container) in the SM, Lab &amp; COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), using GSCs #1105, #1109, #1110. 
 
 FE-6 Creamer closed out the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) payload by shutting down the hardware, removing the spent ORU air filters and deactivating the unit.    [This completes ABRS for Increment 23/24.] 
 
 Afterwards, Timothy initiated recharge on the batteries of the D2Xs EVA cameras and readied the cameras in preparation for tomorrow’s EVA-2 by Bowen &amp; Good.
 
 Later, TJ serviced the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), removing its life-expired EDV-U urine collection container and replacing it with a new one.
 
 FE-3 completed the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.   [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1. This checkup is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently twelve persons.]
 
 Later, Kornienko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Mikhail also performed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko went to work with the Russian KPT-2 BAR payload for a 2.5-hr session, taking background environmental parameters in the SM in areas sampled on 3/4-5 by Oleg Kotov with the KPT-12/Expert experiment and found to have high microflora growth indications (e.g., behind panel 131 and on specific surface areas of the pressurized shell).  FE-1 &amp; FE-3 used the new Piren-B Pyro-endoscope instrument and Iva-6A Thermal Hygrometer (to identify potential condensation areas), with the RSE1 laptop.  The measurements are required to forecast the rate of local shell micro-destruction and to develop measures to extend station life.      [Piren-B, a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, is part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Besides Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
 Working in COL, Tracy Caldwell-Dyson de-installed 10 passive detector packs and one triple detector pack of the DOSIS payload for return.
 
 In Node-3, Tracy performed the periodic inspection &amp; cleaning of the FDS (Fire Detection &amp; Suppression) bacteria filters (BF) and Area Smoke Detectors (SD).
 
 TJ, Oleg &amp; Soichi each had ~60 min set aside for regular crew departure preparations, working on the standard end-of-increment cleanup preparatory to their return.     [It is usual for crewmembers to be granted reduced workdays for making their departure preparations, as their return date approaches.]
 
 CDR, FE-1 &amp; FE-3 were scheduled for their regular PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) scheduled, via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Oleg at ~1:20pm, Misha at ~3:15pm, Sasha at ~4:45pm EDT.
 
 Shortly before sleep time, Kotov will set up the Russian MBI-12 Sonokard payload and start his 9<sup>th</sup> experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 At ~2:20pm, Ham, Reisman, Sellers, Kotov, Skvortsov &amp; Caldwell-Dyson joined up for three PAO TV interview downlinks of ~6.5 minutes each, with MSNBC (Contessa Brewer), Fox News Channel (Megyn Kelly) and CNN Situation Room (Wolf Blitzer).
 
 The ISS crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-3).
 
 AT ~2:45pm, Tracy &amp; Soichi joined the Shuttle crew for an in-depth one-hour review of procedures for the EVA-2 spacewalk, with egress scheduled tomorrow morning at ~7:50am.
 
 At ~6:20pm, Bowen (EV2) &amp; Good (EV3) will begin their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) in the A/L with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe (~5:15pm-6:20pm) and sleep from 6:50pm-2:50am.  The usual hygiene break, with temporary repress to 14.7psi and depress back to 10.2psi, is scheduled for 3:30am-4:40am.   [Sleep for the ISS crew begins at 6:20pm.]
 
 EVA-1 SGANT Attachment Issue:   During EVA-1, the crew encountered free play between the dish and antenna book, i.e., a ~1mm gap which remained even when torque was increased.  Leading cause is that the dish and the boom were not in thermal equilibrium which could have caused binding of the guide pins.  Impacts to EVA-3 duration and scheduled tasks are being assessed. 
 
 EVA-2 LDRI Cable Fix:    As a new ~30min task added to tomorrow’s EVA-2 timeline, a crewmember will attempt to undo the obstructed Shuttle LDRI (Laser Dynamic Range Imager) sensor cable by releasing it from its pinched spot, pull the snagged cable section toward the cable connector and install a tie wrap around the two ends of the LDRI cable.    [The spacewalker will be stationed on an APFR (Articulated Portable Foot Restraint) on the starboard CETA Crew &amp; Equipment Translation Aid) cart WIF-2 (Worksite Interface Fixture 2), and the LDRI will be presented to him by the SRSM/OBSS.]

 STS-132/Atlantis/ULF-4 Flight Plan Notes:
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Atlantis’ 12-day mission delivered the Russian-built MRM-1 (Mini Research Module-1) that will provide additional storage space and a new docking port for Russian Soyuz &amp; Progress spacecraft.  MRM-1, named Rassvet (“Dawn” in Russian), is now permanently attached to the nadir port of the station’s FGB module.  MRM-1 will carry important hardware on its exterior including a radiator, airlock and a European robotic arm.  Atlantis also delivered additional station hardware stored inside a cargo carrier.  Three spacewalks (by Reisman, Bowen &amp; Good) are planned to stage spare components outside the station, including six spare batteries, a Ku-band antenna and spare parts for the Canadian Dextre robotic arm.
