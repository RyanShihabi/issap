SpaceX-3 Launch Delayed:  Due to contamination found on the beta cloth shields in the SpaceX-3 unpressurized external trunk, the decision was made to move the launch of SpX-3 to later in the month.  The exact day of launch will be assessed by ground teams.  Specialists are reviewing options for addressing the contamination issue on the beta cloth shields.     
Environmental Health System (EHS) – Sound Level Meter (SLM) Setup and Operations: Earlier this morning Commander (CDR) Wakata set up the SLM to perform acoustic measurements of the ISS. This is a routine activity to measure the acoustic environment in the habitable areas. Data is transferred to a Station Support Computer (SSC) for downlink to the ground for assessment.
Dragon On Board Training (OBT) Offset Grapple: In preparation for SpX-3 berthing, Wakata and Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Mastracchio performed this OBT in the Cupola followed by a conference with ground teams.  The crew members practiced several grapple approaches.  Following the activity, the crew disassembled the Robotics Work Station (RWS).
Treadmill 2 (T2) 6-Month Inspection: This morning Mastracchio completed this routine maintenance on the T2. He cleaned the closeout panels, greased forward and rear axles, inspected treadmill motor carriage bolts and belts.
