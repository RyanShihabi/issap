ISS On-Orbit Status 01/22/11
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – Shortened day (by 5 hrs): Wake – 6:00am; sleep – 4:30pm (return to normal). 
 
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>HTV 2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle) Launch: The HTV2 launched successfully from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan at 12:38 am EST.  HTV2 activation and initial checkout were completed successfully after launch.  HTV2 capture is scheduled for 7:15 am EST and berthing at 10:40 am on 1/27.</li></ul> 
 FE-1 Kaleri conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Alex will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 At wake-up, FE-2 Skripochka terminated his 9<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
 At wake-up, CDR Scott Kelly, FE-5 Paolo Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Cady Coleman completed their 7<sup>th</sup> post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Scott performed the periodic (monthly) battery check and reboot of all active US PCS (Portable Computer System) laptops in Lab, A/L (Airlock), CUP (Node-3 Cupola), SM and of the COL PWS (Columbus Orbital Laboratory Portable Workstation) laptops, recording the battery state of charge of each of them.
 
 Working periodic maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), FE-6 Coleman removed &amp; replaced both cable arm ropes, then evacuated its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.
 
 Kaleri completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
 FE-1 also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
 Final post-EVA closeout activities by Skripochka &amp; Kondratyev were –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Set up the Orlan-MK suits, gloves, umbilicals and BSS interface units for drying out. </li> </ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Returning the EVA emergency first-aid medical packs, staged temporarily in the PkhO (Transfer Compartment) and DC1, to their original stowage sites in the SM med locker and Soyuz spacecraft,</li><li>Removing the BNP #3 (portable air repress bottle 3) from the SM RO for stowage;</li><li>Downloading the EVA photographs from the NIKON D2Xs cameras to the SSC-15 (Station Support Computer 15) U drive for subsequent OCA downlink;</li><li>Setting up the first Orlan-MK 825-M3 battery pack for discharge and starting discharge,</li><li>Taking radiation readings from the Orlan-carried PILLE dosimeters,</li><li>Refilling the Orlan feedwater bladders,</li><li>Checking out the Orlan-MK spacesuits, and</li><li>Completing Orlan and BSS Orlan Interface Unit equipment storage activities.</li></ul> 
 At ~9:30am, Cady Coleman had her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
 Before sleeptime, Dmitri sets up the Russian MBI-12 payload and starts his 4<sup>th</sup> Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 The six crewmembers worked out with an abbreviated physical exercise regimen on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-4, FE-6) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
