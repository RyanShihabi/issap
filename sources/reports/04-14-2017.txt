Joint Station Local Area Network (LAN) Version 10.0 Transition: This morning the crew replaced the Edge Routers in the Lab and Node 2. Following the hardware replacement, ground teams began intsalling JSL v10 and configuring the network using the upgraded routers. The previously installed Integrated Station LAN (ISL) Routers were reaching end of life on their flash memory and the new upgrades allow support of gigabit ethernet connectivity which will result in increased network throughput. Checkout of the system by ground teams is in work and proceeding nominally.
S11A_C Remote Power Controller (RPC) 3 Status:  Yesterday afternoon, Flight Controllers successfully commanded this RPC closed after a 3rd attempt.  Full activation of the Starboard Thermal Radiator (STR) MDM was then successfully performed. This RPC had initially tripped open on Monday as a result of a Field Effect Transistor (FET) Controller Hybrid (FCH) failure. 
N21B4B_B  RPC 16 Status:  This RPC which powers the Node 2 Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL) System Flow Control Assembly (SFCA) Valve was successfully closed yesterday afternoon. Closure of this RPC enables the ability for closed-loop control of the Node2 MTL loop flow. Ground teams are assessing the root cause of this RPC trip which occurred this past Wednesday.
