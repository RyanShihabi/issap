ISS On-Orbit Status 06/15/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
  
 CDR Alexander Skvortsov started out by conducting the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 At wake-up, FE-2 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson continued her current session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Caldwell-Dyson also continued the new week-long run of the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), her 4<sup>th</sup>, transferring data from her Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 The crew performed the mandatory 1h 20m OBT (onboard training) Depress Emergency Readiness drill for the case of rapid cabin depressurization, with Russian &amp; US specialists standing by at both control centers for crew questions or comments, followed by a 10-min debrief with ground specialists.  The crew practiced ISS depress response procedures, coordination between themselves during the depress, and coordination with Mission Control Centers during the depress as well as on emergency egress from the ISS.      [Background:  Purpose of the drill is to (a) familiarize the station residents with the location of hardware and the positions of valves used in emergency situations, (b) perform a survey of each hatch for drag-through cables (and reporting results to MCC), (c) work through the RS (Russian Segment) hardware deactivation procedures, (c) practice crew emergency joint activities, and (d) identify crew comments and suggestions that arise during training regarding crew procedures and equipment.   In the RS, the crew usually translates along the emergency egress paths to the MRM2 port (where Soyuz 22S is currently docked), checking hardware such as the Sokol suits, cable cutters, fire extinguisher (OKR), gas masks (IPK), emergency procedures books, valve settings, hatch rubber seal &amp; restraint integrity, etc.  In the US Segment (USOS) the inspection usually focuses on readiness of CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products), ISS leak kit, PBA (portable breathing assembly) and PFE (portable fire extinguisher), emergency procedures books, valve settings, integrity of hatch rubber seals, presence of hatch handrails, etc.  The checks also include Node-3, Node-2, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), JLP (Japanese Experiment Module Experiment Logistics Module Pressurized Section) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).  The exercise was topped off by a debrief with the ground via S-band.  During the session, the crew simulated executing the planned emergency procedures while moving about the station.  For the case of an onboard fire and for emergency descent, there are other mandatory emergency drill OBTs.]
 
 Today was water sampling &amp; processing time aboard the station, completed by Tracy Caldwell-Dyson who –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Conducted the periodic WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer) in Node-3, after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.  [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged];</li><li>Collected “Week 14” water samples in the SM (Service Module) for in-flight and ground analysis, taking them from the SRV-K Warm, SRV-K Hot and SVO-ZV taps.    [Tracy collected two 750 mL chemical postflight samples for return on ULF-5, three 125 mL in-flight samples each for microbial analysis, and one 20 mL sample each for in-flight silver detection (SDTO/Station Development Test Objective) using EHS C-SPE (Environmental Health System / Colorimetric Solid-Phase Extraction) analysis];</li><li>Took water samples from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser)’s ambient “leg” for microbial in-flight processing, TOCA analysis &amp; post-flight analysis; and</li><li>Processed the inflight SM &amp; PWD water samples with the WMK MCD (Water Microbiology Kit / Microbial Capture Devices) for microbial traces, and the CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for inflight coliform indications (Magenta for Positive, Yellow for Negative).   [The activity must be conducted within 6 hrs after water collection from the PWD line.  The visual T+2 Day microbial (bacterial &amp; fungal) analysis of the potable water samples will be performed on 6/17.]</li></ul> 
 Working ~2 hrs in the FGB and DC1 Docking Compartment, FE-3 Kornienko performed the periodic inventory/audit of Russian EVA tools and gear.     [Using uplinked IMS (Inventory Management System) listings, Mikhail checked, counted &amp; measured spacewalk equipment such as safety tethers, KPU tool carrier, hammer, scissor, pry bar, cutter, wire ties, knives, wrenches, wrist straps and pliers, for the purpose of recording inconsistencies in the lists with actual locations and numbers.]
 
 After terminating the overnight charging of the SONY HVR-Z1J camcorder battery, CDR Skvortsov set up the GFI-1 Relaksatsiya (“relaxation”) hardware at SM window 9 for another session, then activated &amp; configured the operational modes and at ~10:40am-10:50am EDT performed the measurement run.  Later, the hardware was turned off, torn down and removed.     [The experiment uses the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and HD (High Definition) camcorder to observe the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.  Relaksatsiya normally deals with the study of the chemoluminescent chemical reactions and atmospheric light phenomena (emissions, i.e., molecular relaxation processes), including those that occur during high-velocity interaction between the exhaust products from space vehicles and the atmosphere at orbital altitude and during the entry of space vehicles into the Earth's upper atmosphere.]
 
 Later, Alexander conducted another photo/video imaging session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining data on oceanic water blooms in the waters of South-Eastern Pacific with the NIKON D3 &amp; SONY HDV camcorder, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop.
 
 Mikhail Kornienko had 2.5 hrs set aside to continue cargo removal &amp; transfers from the MRM1 Rassvet module.    [This involved removing interior panels (302, 304, 306, 102, 104, 107), unscrewing tie-down bolts, cutting cargo straps, detaching storage frames and retrieving 7 Russian &amp; 9 US cargo bags from the frames for stowage in MRM1 or handover to Caldwell-Dyson for stowage in the USOS (US Segment).]
 
 The CDR conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Sasha also did the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Tracy, Misha &amp; Sasha completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).
 
 OGS Pump ORU Update:  The replacement of the OGS (Oxygen Generation System) water recirculation pump reported yesterday had to be deferred since the necessary equalization of cabin temperature with the OGS rack temperature had not been accomplished.  The R&amp;R was re-scheduled for tomorrow.
 
 Elektron Shutdown Update:  The automatic shutdown of the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator on 6/11 evening, reported here on 6/12, was commanded by the controlling software due to a high temperature reading from the KOB-1 internal thermal control loop.  After TsUP-Moscow switched the Elektron to KOB-2, the system returned to nominal function in 32amp mode.
 
 Vozdukh Test Update:  For today and tomorrow, the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) scrubber is being assessed by ground specialists for its efficiency in removing CO<sub>2</sub> from the ISS atmosphere.  The US CDRA (CO<sub>2</sub> Removal Assembly) will remain deactivated for the duration of the test and will be reactivated either tomorrow (6/16) or if CO<sub>2</sub> levels reach flight rule limits or the crew reports symptoms.
 
 Soyuz TMA-19/23S Launch Preparations:   At Baikonur, countdown of the Soyuz-FG launcher for TMA-19 is continuing nominally, for tonight’s launch at 5:35pm EDT with Fyodor Yurchikhin (Russia), Doug Wheelock (USA) &amp;  Shannon Walker (USA).

 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were N'Djamena, Chad (this capital city of about 1 million is located on the southwest border of the country at the confluence of the Chari and Logone rivers and about 75 miles southeast of Lake Chad.  As ISS tracked over Lake Chad in late morning with the probability of some clouds being present, the crew was to begin looking slightly right of track for this low-contrast target), Lilongwe, Malawi (popcorn cumulus was likely present over the capital city of Malawi.  Lilongwe was visible slightly to the right of track.  The city is located to the southwest of Lake Malawi.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban area and surroundings were requested; such context imagery will aid in locating higher resolution imagery), Aurora Borealis (the aurora forecast for today is “active”.  Looking north and east of orbit track, towards the Bering Strait and the Chukchi Sea), Galapagos Islands, Ecuador (HMS Beagle site:  On October 1, 1835 Darwin landed on Isabela Island.  He found the island arid and sterile.  Water, which collected in pits, was discovered to be not good for drinking.  On October 20<sup>th</sup>, he left the Galapagos and set sail for Tahiti.  Looking left of track for a context view of Isabela Island), and Matavai Bay, Tahiti (HMS Beagle site. Looking on the north coast of Tahiti, the largest island for Matavai Bay.  Darwin stopped here in November 1835, near the present capital city, Papeete.  In Darwin's words: " …we landed to enjoy all the delights of the first impressions produced by a new country … - Crowds of men, women &amp; children were collected on the memorable point Venus ready to receive us…" [this was the site where Captain Cook in HMS Endeavour observed the transit of Venus on 3 June 1769].  Darwin climbed a narrow river gorge heading towards the central peak of the island, remarking "These precipices must have been some thousand feet high; the whole formed a mountain gorge far more magnificent than anything I had ever beheld.")
