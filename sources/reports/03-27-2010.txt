ISS On-Orbit Status 03/27/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – crew off-duty day.   &gt;&gt;&gt;On this day in 1969, NASA launched Mariner 7 to Mars.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
  At wake-up, FE-6 Creamer continued the new week-long session of experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s third, transferring data from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Also at day begin, CDR Oleg Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime this morning, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  The three station residents completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the house cleaning, Kotov conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  Oleg also took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Timothy Creamer performed a new session with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.  It was his 5<sup>th</sup> time.      [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
  TJ also rebooted the OCA Router and FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops, a regular bi-monthly task.
 
  Working off his discretionary “time permitting” task list, Oleg Kotov –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Completed another Lake Baikal      video recording session with the SONY HVR-Z7U camcorder.  [Roskosmos TV      studio is working on a feature on Lake Baikal and its importance as      natural heritage, called ‘Planet Baikal’.  The feature      will be broadcast in Vesti      channel’s weekly program Kosmonavtika.       The Baikal Lake contains 20% of the world’s water reserves; it is a      beautiful and a mysterious lake.  The producers want to highlight the      grandeur of this natural gem and raise awareness about its pollution      problems. The metaphor used throughout the feature is one of a planet, an      element of the Universe and a cosmonaut talking about Baikal while on      orbit is thought to be a perfect choice to convey it. The feature item      will be filmed and broadcast to Earth in real time later (April 6-9)];</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Conducted a photography      run of the GFI-8      "Uragan"      (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera (with      SIGMA AF 300-800mm telelens) of specific targets. [South coast of      Crimea from Sevastopol to Kerch, the flood situation at the      Volga-Akhtyubinsk plain and in the Irtysh river valley, rivers of Central      Russia before flooding (Oka, Don, and their estuaries, Ugra), the preflood      situation in the Don river valley, Volga-Akhtubinsk flood plain situation      &amp; fires, overall view of Aral Sea, snow-free tips of Pamir glaciers,      the flood situation on the rivers of Europe from Rhine &amp; Danube to      Dniester basin],</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Completed a session for      Russia's EKON      Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial      photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the Nikon D3X, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Performed the periodic documentary close-up      photography of the two SKK materials      exposure payloads mounted on the outside of the station,- SKK-2 on the “Pirs” Docking Compartment      (DC-1) from SM window #6, and SKK-9 on the SM      hull from the DC-1 EVA hatch window, then transferring the digital images      to a removable return disk on the RSK-1 laptop.</li> </ul> 
  At ~8:30am EDT, the crew held their usual WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).
