Boeing CST-100 Crewed Flight Test (CFT): The crew performed CFT Departure Preparation and crew conferences with the ground team to prepare for CFT undock.
Systems:
Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Latching End Effector A (LEE A) Survey:The ground team is in the process of completing a survey of LEE A using remote commanding. The SSRMS is being used to position LEE A in front of the External High-Definition Camera (EHDC) and the LEE A snares are partially closed to prepare for the survey. All data will be downlinked to the ground for review. 
Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Manual Fill Initiation and Termination: Today, the crew initiated a manual fill of the WHC EДВ-СВ (Water Container) using a Post-Flight Analysis Bag to capture any pressure relief to protect the dose pump. The fill was then terminated, and the Post-Flight Analysis Bag was analyzed after the pressure relief burp. The ЕДВ-CB is intended for short-term storage and manual water transportation between facilities. After successfully filling the EДВ-СВ, the crew returned the WHC to nominal use.
