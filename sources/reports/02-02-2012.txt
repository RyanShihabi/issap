ISS On-Orbit Status 02/02/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
After wakeup this morning, FE-4 Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
CDR Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers &amp; FE-6 Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 26<sup>th</sup> for Dan, the 19<sup>th</sup> for André and Don.  The three crewmembers are performing their RST sleep shift session starting on 1/24 and every day through 2/2 (today).        [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Burbank concluded his 2<sup>nd</sup> (FD30) ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~10:40am EST).  Later, Dan powered on the laptop and downloaded the data from the two Actiwatch Spectrums, copied the data from the 2 HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC and downloaded Cardiopres data.         [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.]
 
FE-6 Pettit conducted Part 2 of the periodic acoustic measurement protocol, retrieving the crew-worn acoustic dosimeters of the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) from the three crewmembers and deploying them for static measurements in the station.      [#1004 in SM above TVIS treadmill, #1003 in Node-3, #1005 in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).]
 
Afterwards, Don printed out new double-sided Robotics cue cards and deployed one copy of each cue card at the Lab &amp; Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstations).  Old cards were discarded as trash.
 
Dan Burbank &amp; André Kuipers are on Day 5 of Session 1 of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment, continuing the current High Salt diet, with daily diet log entries.  Today’s activities besides diet logging involved taking blood samples, followed by PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) analysis and preservation in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) as well as starting 24-hr urine collections.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Paolo is ingesting special diet (Session 1 �C High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level; Session 2 �C Low salt diet).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 &amp; 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged &amp; inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
FE-2 Ivanishin executed the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA.
 
Afterwards, Anatoly continued the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, today working ~2h20m in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok) cleaning the grilles of interior panels 201, 301 &amp; 401, followed by the vent screens of panels 116, 316, 231 &amp; 431.
 
In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), the CDR supported the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 1 once every two hours for seven days.  Burbank performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.]
 
Don went on a search for a CD (Compact Disk) with new software to be loaded into a new MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) T61p laptop, though not finding it at first at the designated location.      [It is planned to transition the MSG rack laptop (MLC) tomorrow to a T61p.  MSG software Version 3.1 will be loaded on the T61p laptop after the swap.] 
 
For his next VO<sub>2</sub>max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake &amp; Submaximal Estimates of VO<sub>2</sub>max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) with Thermolab session, his 3<sup>rd</sup>, scheduled tomorrow, Burbank set up the PPFS MBS (Portable Pulmonary Function System / Mixing Bag System) in ESA’s COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and configured the necessary PPFS power, data, front panel, and gas connections.
 
Anton &amp; Oleg spent several hours retrieving equipment &amp; tools required for their Russian EVA-30 in 2/16 from stowage, followed by gathering their Orlan-MK ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) and support gear for the spacewalk.      [Equipment retrieval was supported by an uplinked itemized listing of 24 components.  Kononenko will be wearing Orlan suit #4 (blue) with mounted BRTA (Orlan Telemetry Unit) #6, Shkaplerov Orlan #6 (blue) with BRTA #9.]
 
Dan had ~1.5 h for gathering US EVA tools in preparation for use by Anton &amp; Oleg during the RS EVA-30.
 
In the Lab, André Kuipers serviced the EarthKAM (EKAM/Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack by changing battery twice during the day.     [EK uses a NIKON D2Xs electronic still camera with 50mm and 180mm lenses, powered by a battery, taking pictures by remote operation from the ground, without crew interaction.  It is available for students who submit image requests and conduct geographic research.  The requests are uplinked in a camera control file to the A31p SSC-20 (Station Support Computer) laptop which then activates the camera at specified times and receives the digital images from the camera’s storage card on its hard drive, for subsequent downlink via OpsLAN.  The camera battery is changed when no pictures are being taken.  EKAM uses new software on SSC-20 which replaces the version used for the DCS 760 camera. This is the 4<sup>th </sup>use of the D2Xs camera by EKAM.  Students around the world are anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images.]
 
Later, André performed periodic maintenance on the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) by removing &amp; replacing its filter ORU.     [There is one more spare filter onboard; additional spares are manifested on ATV3.]
 
Kuipers also retrieved &amp; stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies, deployed by him on 1/31 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.       [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
Afterwards, FE-5 built another EDV container from a bucket.
 
Using the Russian Kompressor-M (#41) pump with the A-R hose and pressure adapter, Anatoly Ivanishin spent ~3 hrs filling 5 EDV containers (952, 995, 1042, 986, 987) from the Rodnik BV1 tank of the SM, then flushed BV1 with disinfectant from an EDV-OP.     [The SM Rodnik BV1 contained about 100 L of water.]
 
Anton, Anatoly &amp; Oleg undertook the periodic (generally monthly) health test with the cardiological experiment PZEh MO-1 (“Study of the Bioelectric Activity of the Heart at Rest”) on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), their 2<sup>nd</sup>.     [Equipment used was VPG/Temporal Pulsogram and 8-channel ECG/Electrocardiogram Data Output Devices (USI).  The test took place during an RGS (Russian Groundsite) overflight window (~12:25pm EST) via VHF for data downlink from the VPG and Gamma-1M ECG for about 5-6 minutes.]
 
Pettit performed an inspection of the T2/COLBERT treadmill, looking for possible damage resulting from a recent brief episode of unisolated use by the crew.     [Don’s downlink: “No loose screws, thumb wheels, or bolts.  All witness marks aligned, snubbers well centered in cups.”]
 
Next, FE-6 activated the Italian ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts) SHIELD radiation dosimeter, using the laptop in ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2) for a periodic data collection.
 
Later, Pettit worked in the Kibo JPM taking IMV (Inter Module Ventilation) flow measurements with the Velocicalc instrument at various locations (inlets at IMV Ovhd Aft &amp; Stbd Aft, outlet at Stbd Fwd).
 
Don also set up the JAXA Space Sakura (“cherry tree”) experiment in JPM, after conferring with ground specialists at ~7:50am EST and collecting equipment and tools, opening the Sakura Box, adjusting the TM750 camcorder for video recording and activating the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) for real-time downlinking of the imagery of floating petals.
 
Afterwards, FE-6 supported the ground in swapping the THC CCAA (Temperature &amp; Humidity Control / Common Cabin Air Assembly) air conditioner in the U.S. Lab from port to starboard to port by closing off the P6 MFCV (Manual Flow Control Valve) and opening the S6 MFCV.  This allowed the swapover from the CCAA port channel (P6) to the alternate system on starboard (S6).     [The CCAA is a network of ducting that draws in the air through filters, delivers it for conditioning, and returns it to the modules.  The swap-over between the CCAA channels is generally done by the ground once a month, with crew support, to dry out the heat exchanger of the deactivated side.  MCC-H flight controllers command the required systems configurations for the dryout via S-band
 
André Kuipers conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.         [The current card (29-0008H) lists 60 CWCs (1404.7 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (21 CWCs with 853.7 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria, plus 1 empty bag, and 3 CWCs with 129 L for contingency use;  2. Condensate water (2 CWCs with 9.8 L, 9 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (14 CWCs with 245.1 L; also 8 expired bags with 140.5 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 6.4 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
Ivanishin performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Anatoly also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
At ~5:45am EST, André conducted the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with COL-CC at Oberpfaffenhofen/Germany. 
 
At ~9:10 am, Kuipers participated in an ESA PAO TV event, talking with students from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy and Portugal of The Mission X Competition at ESA’s Erasmus Centre, Noordwijk, Holland, greeting the public in 5 languages (Good afternoon, everybody; Goededag, Nederland; Guten Tag, Switzerland; Buongiorno, Italia; Ola, Portugal).
 
At ~11:05am, CDR Burbank supported a PAO TV event, responding to questions from students at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy at New London, Connecticut.    [The event was attended by Dr. Ron Adrezin, Professor at USCGA and close friend of Dan; K-12 students from USCGA mentor schools �C Friendship Academy of Engineering and Technology (Baltimore), Coretta Scott King YWL High School (Atlanta), MAST Academy (Miami), Key Biscayne K-8 (Miami), Science and Technology Magnet School of Southeast Connecticut (New London); friends of Dan Burbank, Captain Jon Russell and Commander Rob Oatman.]
 
At ~1:15pm, the crew had their weekly teleconference with ISS Program Management at JSC/Houston via Ku-band/video &amp; S-band/audio.
 
Before Presleep, Pettit turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don will turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
Before sleeptime, Ivanishin will set up the battery of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment for charging.     [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2/2x, FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
