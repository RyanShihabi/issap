New Status:
Spinal Ultrasound: Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Parmitano completed his first of three planned Spinal Ultrasound scans with FE-6 Nyberg as the operator and with remote guidance assistance from ground specialists. The Crew Medical Restraint System (CMRS) was used for subject positioning.  Spinal Ultrasound aims to use ground and space-based studies to characterize spinal changes during and after spaceflight.  Ground based pre- and post-flight Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and high fidelity ultrasound, combined with in-flight ultrasound will be used to characterize and assign a mission health risk to microgravity-associated spinal alterations for back pain and potential injury.
Systems Operations Data File (SODF) Deploy: FE-3 Cassidy deployed new Warning Books that include X2R12 updates and an EVA Systems Book to support upcoming USOS EVAs. These documents were delivered on Automatic Transfer Vehicle (ATV)4.
ATV4 Cargo Operations: All 3 USOS crew members performed an estimated 13 hours 50 minutes of cargo operations in under 6 hours of actual crew time today, and completed more than had been expected for this week’s ATV4 cargo transfer activities.  Following the transfer to and from the ATV, the crew took closeout photos in preparation for ATV4 hatch closure prior to Russian EVA #33 planned for Monday, June 24.
