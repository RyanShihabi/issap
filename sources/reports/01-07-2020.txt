SpX-19 Unberth/Release:  The SpX-19 Dragon vehicle was robotically released from the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) at approximately 4:05 am CT.  The ISS Commander was stationed at the Robotic Work Station (RWS), monitored the release of Dragon, and commanded the first two separation burns. The Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California at approximately 09:42 am CT.  Once the Dragon vehicle has been recovered, the time critical science samples will be delivered to principle investigators for analysis.
