Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations for Cygnus Capture: Today the Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS and performed a Node-2 Nadir Active Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) survey with the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).  They then maneuvered the SSRMS to the Cygnus High Hover position in preparation for capture and powered the MSS into the hot backup configuration.
Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Mastracchio and FE-6 Wakata monitored the Cygnus approach from the Cupola Robotic Workstation (RWS) and captured Cygnus using the SSRMS at approximately 5:08am CST.  They then maneuvered Cygnus into position to inspect the Passive CBM and proceeded with a successful installation onto the Node-2 Nadir Active CBM. The crew was ahead of the timeline today and continued with Controller Panel Assembly (CPA) removal, hatch opening/ingress, and started cargo transfer which were all originally scheduled for Monday, January 13th.
