ISS On-Orbit Status 06/05/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – Crew off duty.
 
  At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  At day’s begin, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued her current 4-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 3<sup>rd</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
  Also at wake-up, FE-2 completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  The three residents performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  FE-3 Kornienko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
  FE-3 also performed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems (UOV) in the SM &amp; FGB, cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
 
  An additional task for Misha in the SM was the routine weekly inspection of the SVO SRV-K2M (Condensate Water Processor) hoses from the MF-R Diaphragm Separator Filter to the BRPK Condensate Separation &amp; Pumping Unit.
 
  Caldwell-Dyson performed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops.
 
  Later, Tracy set up the video equipment, focused on the PCS C&amp;W (Portable Computer System Caution &amp; Warning) display page with a NetMeeting conference downlink to MCC-Houston via Ku-band.      [Purpose: to allow MCC-H to monitor ISS status during an extended (7-hr) LOS (Loss of Signal) period planned tonight at 6:00pm-1:00am EDT.  The ISS service outage involves the IPS MDSC (Integrated Planning System Mission Data Server Computer) for necessary upgrade work (installation of firmware on the 16-port MDSC fiber database servers). During the outages, all IPS Mission Data Server (IPS home directories) will be unavailable, i.e. no Long Term Planning updates or OSTPV (Onboard Short Term Plan Viewer) updates, no S-band CMD (Command), TLM (Telemetry), voice, etc.  MCC-H &amp; POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center/Huntsville) will still have Ku-band telemetry, video, and OCA capability, and RS (Russian Segment) ground sites will still be available.  In the unlikely event that the crew would need to contact Houston, they can use Russian UKV (VHF), IP Phone, or NetMeeting.] 
 
  Tracy transferred two new uplinked CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) protocols to her PCMCIA memory card, as per her request to her ASCR (Astronaut Strength, Conditioning, &amp; Rehabilitation) specialist.
 
  Following up on the earlier detection of metal shavings in the MRM1 Rassvet module, CDR Skvortsov was to perform an inspection of the MRM1 hatch screen, taking photographs for subsequent downlink and cleaning the screen with the vacuum cleaner if shavings or foreign materials were found. 
 
  Before her sleeptime, Tracy will set up the equipment for her next 24-hour urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood &amp; urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
  At ~9:10am, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  Tracy, Misha &amp; Sasha completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).
 
  Jobs listed for Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko for today on the Russian discretionary “as time permits” task list were –

 SM Reboost Update:    As per plan, a one-burn ISS reboost was conducted last night at 11:20pm EDT using SM main propulsion, i.e., its two main engines.  Performance was nominal.  Burn duration: 4 min 7 sec; delta-V: 4.5 m/s/14.76 ft/s (predicted 4.36 m/s/14.30 ft/s).  Mean altitude gain:  7.79 km/4.21 nmi (predicted  7.55 km/4.07 nmi).  Purpose: set up orbital phasing for both Soyuz 23S &amp; Progress 38P launch/dock conditions.
 
 Progress Reboosts:  Two more reboost maneuvers, this time by Progress 37P, will be conducted on 6/7 (Monday), one orbit apart, to fine-tune phasing for both 23S Soyuz &amp; 38P Progress launch conditions.
