Crew-3 Endurance Departure: The Crew-3 Endurance spacecraft departed ISS with its crew of four crewmembers on May 5 at 12:20 am CT. CDR Raja Chari, PLT Tom Marshburn, MS1 Matthias Maurer and MS2 Kayla Barron are scheduled to splash down near Tampa, Florida on May 5 at 23:43 CST. This concludes a 175 day flight for the Crew-3 Endurance spacecraft.
European Robotic Arm (ERA) Operations: Crew performed operations to disconnect ERA’s End Effector 2 from Base Arm Attachment Point 1 and attach that End Effector 2 to Base Arm Attachment Point 3.  The attachment to Base Arm Attachment Point 3 was unsuccessful, so the ERA was moved to a Park position while ground specialists review the data and develop a forward plan. The Park position is a safe long term configuration and is safe for all ISS dynamic operations.  The walk-off to Base Arm Attachment Point 3 is the last step in ERA Mission 2 operations.
