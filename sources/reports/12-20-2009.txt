ISS On-Orbit Status 12/20/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday – crew rest day.   Ahead: Week 4 of Increment 22.
 
  Flight Engineer Suraev began the day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by him on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  Commander Williams completed another Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  A total of 121 RST runs are assigned to Jeff for the duration of his orbital stay.]
 
  The CDR also supported the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  The FE took care of the periodic dump of log file directories to the ground, today from the Russian RS2 laptop to a USB stick and from there to OCA for downlink to TsUP, for a checkout of the TVM Terminal Computer and the MPI Multifunction Indicator Panel of the MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2).
 
  Suraev also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Williams completed the daily status check of the APEX-Cambium hardware, looking for health and color of the plants.  Because the Cambium plants were removed from the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) and thus ground-based monitoring, a daily status check &amp; weekly photo session are necessary.     [When completed, the APEX-Cambium payload in conjunction with the NASA-sponsored TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System) will determine the role of gravity in Cambium wood cell development (providing the pulp &amp; paper and construction industries insight into the fundamental mechanisms of wood cell formation) and demonstrate non-destructive reporter gene technology &amp; investigate spaceflight plant stress.  APEX-Cambium provides NASA &amp; the ISS community a permanent controlled environment capability to support growth of various organisms (i.e. whole plants).]
 
  At ~11:30am EST, Maxim downlinked PAO TV messages of greetings to two Russian events: (1) for Power Engineers Day on 12/22  [“…power energy is a vascular system of the entire country. Your hard but noble labor produces, first of all, warmth and light for every family, every city, or small village of our vast Motherland.  It is best seen from here, from the orbit.  We can affirm that without your participation not a single flight to space or human breakthrough in space would have been possible.  Wishing you to stay in good health, new achievements for the sake of peace, harmony, happiness, and well being.”]; and (2) for the annual New Year performance for children at Moscow City Hall, taking place from 12/24 through 1/10.  [This year’s performance has aliens kidnap Father Frost and fly away with him to another planet.  Children and the Snow Maid are setting  forth for a search and the rescue of Father Frost and appeal to ISS7 for help.  “Hello, hello,  this is Maxim Suraev, Expedition 22 ISS cosmonaut.”   “Maxim, hello, this is the Snow Maiden.”   “Snow Maiden, Children, Happy New Year!  Our planet Earth looks notably more beautiful during these New Year holidays.”   “Maxim, I have an issue to discuss with you.  Please, tell me, are you planning to launch any vehicle any time soon?”   “Next launch is scheduled for spring.”   “No, spring is too late.  Thank you.  We’ll think of something. Happy New Year!”   “And Happy New Year to you too!  And to all Muscovites. And to all people on Earth.”]
 
  The crew had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Maxim at ~5:35am, Jeff at ~1:00pm EST.
 
  Jeff &amp; Maxim performed their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE).
 
  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.

 <strong>CSL Update:</strong><strong>   Jeff’s work with the Crew Support LAN (Local Areas Network) on T61p platforms yesterday ran into a snag.  “Gh</strong>ost image” files were downlinked from the transport hard drive and from the CSL Boot CD.  It will probably take several days to determine where the problem may lie, i.e., until after 21S docking.  In the meantime, SSC-8 (station Support Computer 8) is in a good configuration and can be used by the crew as needed without changes
 
 JAXA SLT Update:  Yesterday, SLT1 (System Laptop Terminal 1) experienced a communication failure.  With SLT2 currently being used as stand-alone for its troubleshooting, the SLT1 failure currently prevents all crew procedures that require SLT usage.  Ground team is working on troubleshoot plan.
 
 Soyuz TMA-17/21S is on schedule for this afternoon’s launch at 4:52pm EST, with Expedition 22 NASA Flight Engineer Timothy J. Creamer (U.S.), Soyuz Commander (&amp; Exp-23 CDR) Oleg Kotov (Russia) and Flight Engineer Soichi Noguchi (Japan).
