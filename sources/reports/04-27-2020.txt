Space Fibers: The crew performed hardware gather and setup in the Microgravity Science Glovebox for the Space Fibers Reflight mission. Manufacturing Fiber Optic Cable in Microgravity (Space Fibers) evaluates a method for producing fiber optic cable from a blend of zirconium, barium, lanthanum, sodium and aluminum, called ZBLAN, in space. ZBLAN produces glass one hundred times more transparent than silica-based glass, exceptional for fiber optics. Microgravity suppresses two mechanisms that commonly degrade fiber, and previous studies showed improved properties in fiber drawn in microgravity compared to that fabricated on the ground.

Treadmill 2 (T2) Annual Maintenance: Today the crew completed the yearly T2 inspection. During this task, the crew inspected the isolators, motor belt, bottom snubbers, treadmill slats and screws, and the bungee shackle key mount witness marks.  They also cleaned the bearing house, the closeout panels, and vacuumed the filter screen as well as inside the rack and around the treadmill. This is nominal periodic corrective maintenance.  An unmanned activation and checkout was completed after the maintenance.
Acoustic Monitor Recording of T2 Audio: Today the crew also performed an Acoustic Monitor recording of the unmanned activation and checkout protocol that is performed prior to and immediately following the T2 yearly maintenance. Two Acoustic Monitors were used to record audio of the T2 at each tread speed.
