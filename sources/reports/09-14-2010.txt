ISS On-Orbit Status 09/14/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      &gt;&gt;&gt;Today 51 years ago (1959), the Soviet probe Luna 2 crashed onto the Moon, becoming the first man-made object to reach it.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
 CDR Skvortsov conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Before morning inspection &amp; breakfast, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson began Day 4 of her current 5-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 5<sup>th</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 Tracy also started another 24-hr collection of urine samples for the NUTRITION / Repository / Pro K protocol, her 3<sup>rd</sup> (FD180) onboard session with the new routine (modified from the past NUTRITION w/Repository protocol).  Later in the day, Caldwell-Dyson broke out and set up the equipment for tomorrow’s blood sample collection.     [The operational products for blood &amp; urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads have been revised, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
 Also upon wake-up, FE-6 Walker performed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Shannon Walker continued her support of the ESA SODI (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument) payload in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) after activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) and adjusting the VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) to transmit her activities to the console team on the ground.     [With the SODI hardware already installed into the MSG WV (Work Volume) yesterday, Shannon today completed the installation of the COLLOID experiment hardware.  SODI uses the same MLC (MSG Laptop Computer) setup as SAME which Shannon also supported very successfully.]
 
 CDR Skvortsov &amp; FE-3 Kornienko performed the periodic 2-hr checkout of the Russian MedOps MO-2 protocol’s Kardiomed equipment and its TLM (telemetry) comm cable connections via BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system, downlinking test data to RGS (Russian Groundsite) at 5:30am EDT via VHF.     [Kardiomed (Cardiomed) uses ECG (Electrocardiograph) and blood pressure measurements, with a five-electrode Holter harness that reads dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over a span of time and records data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.]
 
 Afterwards, Skvortsov conducted periodic (monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new unit from FGB stowage (done last: 8/3).     [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
 In the DC1 Docking Compartment, Kornienko serviced the BTKh-28 CASCADE payload, removing it from the TBU temperature-controlled incubator, performing the mixing process in the KT thermostatic container and returning it to the TBU, set at +29 degC.  FE-5 Yurchikhin photographed the action.
 
 Later, Mikhail broke out and set up the equipment for a test of the Russian SSTV (Slow Scan TV) equipment of the MAI-75 experiment as part of OBR-3 (Obrazovanie-3, Education 3) ops.  This is essentially an ARISS (Amateur Radio from ISS) ham radio set-up with Kenwood TM D700 Transceiver and Kenwood VS-N1 (Visual Communicator) gear for downlinking photographic images of the overflown terrain to ground stations (MAI, Kursk, Star City &amp; other stations around the world).  Later in the day, the test radio session was terminated.  To date, there have been 6 runs with MAI-75 on board the ISS.     [The payload is named after the renowned MAI (Moscow Aviation Institute) whose reputation is based on the large number of famous aviators and rocket scientists that received their academic education here.  Among the alumni are Academicians and Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Over 100 General and Chief Designers earned their degree at MAI, with famous rocket scientists like Makeyev, Mishin, Nadiradze and Yangel.  MAI also fostered 20 Pilot-Cosmonauts, almost 100 famous test pilots, Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia.  The amateur radio (ham) equipment aboard the ISS for downlinking SSTV imagery is a MAI product.]
 
 In support of ground-commanded FIR/ARIS (Fluid Integrated Rack / Active Rack Isolation System) rack calibration tests which require a micro-G environment, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson configured the Lab camcorder and removed the FIR/ARIS alignment guides.  As the ground commanded the rack, Tracy monitored ARIS position control stability during the operations.  Later, the alignment guides were installed again.    [The ground-commanded calibration involves three objectives: (1) Verification that ARIS is stable for 1 and 25 seconds; (2) Observation of range of rack motion as limited by the snubber cups and possible equipment contact with the rack, and (3) Physical movement of the rack in all directions to check on any interferences to the rack or with the motion of the umbilicals.] 
 
 FE-4 Wheelock had about an hour to transfer and unpack US cargo delivered on Progress M-07M/39P.
 
 Other 39P cargo equipment was unloaded by FE-5 Yurchikhin for ~1h 20m, logging moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System).
 
 Working on the BLB (Biolab) in COL, Doug Wheelock continued the installation of its microscope liquid cassette for ground-controlled testing, an activity which he started on 9/8.     [BLB is one of five European payload racks inside COL.  The other four are EPM (European Physiology Module), FSL (Fluid Science Laboratory), EDR (European Drawer Rack) &amp; ETC (European Transport Carrier, which in orbit serves as a workbench and stowage facility).]
 
 Later, with Tracy’s assistance Doug performed troubleshooting on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser machine by removing &amp; replacing the exercise rope in an attempt to remove the extra slack extending from the exit pulley (~8.75 in., i.e. out of tolerance) and restore ARED to its full capability.
 
 In preparation for the ISS reboost scheduled early tomorrow morning, Wheels installed the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab to protect the rack from external loading (dynamic disturbances), and later closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Kibo &amp; Cupola science windows.  
 
 Before sleeptime, Doug also turned on the SAMS ICU (Space Acceleration Measurement System / Interim Control Unit) in ER1 (EXPRESS Rack 1) in the Lab, to take vibrational dynamics measurements during the reboost.
 
 In Node-3, Wheelock installed the HHGRs (Hatch Handle Guide Rings) at the nadir and starboard port.
 
 After yesterday’s preparations, Fyodor Yurchikhin replaced the old BSK-1V Power Switching Unit for the navigation system in the SM (Service Module) with a new spare.   
 
 In the MRM2 Poisk module, FE-5 was also to replace the TVU-2 Terminal Computing Device behind panels 202 &amp; 101, supported by ground specialist tagup via S-band.    [TVU-2 has been down since early March.  TVU-1 provides redundancy in systems commanding.]
 
 Fyodor also worked in the SM on the SRK Radiation Monitoring System, connecting it to the KPTs1 Central Post Computer 1 via the ASP Network Connections Adapter, supported by specialist tagup.      [This has become necessary because of the failed BRI Smart Router.]
 
 Servicing the BTKh-6,7 ARIL &amp; OChB biotechnology science payloads, Alex inserted the pack inside a Ziploc bag (marked “KTsN”) into the thermostatic container at +4C, with photo documentation.    [ARIL investigates the effects of the space flight environment on the development of strains producing the interleukins 1�, 1�, aryl.  OChB studies microgravity effects on the strain producing superoxide dismutase.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson conducted the monthly maintenance inspection of the T2/COLBERT treadmill, checking the SBS (Series Bungee System) bungees, rack centering, calibrating the load cell, components, pin alignment, and the snubber jam nut witness marks.  After the last exercise of the day on T2, Tracy installed the 4 snubber alignment guides as protection during the reboost maneuvers under RS attitude control.    [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- &amp; Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm; their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.]
 
 With the Lab CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) restored to full service yesterday and the Node-3 CDRA not now required, Tracy supported its deactivation by disconnecting its LTL (Low Temperature Loop) return line at the AR2 (Atmosphere Revitalization 2) rack.
 
 In the JAXA Kibo JPM, FE-6 Walker tested the effectiveness of cleaning the ventilation return grille with the JPM THC (Temperature &amp; Humidity Control) fans temporarily stopped. 
 
  In the Kibo laboratory, Shannon prepared the equipment for a new JAXA EPO (Educational Payload Operations) project called “Message in a Bottle” or SpaceBottle.      [After a conference with the PI (Principal Investigator) explaining the mission, Shannon used the G1 camcorder, MPC and miniDV tape to complete the video message in the bottle.  Holding the bottle, FE-6 was to record an announcement that the bottle “will contain outer space”, adding today’s date and her signature to the bottle’s outer surface.
 
   Purpose of the “Message in a Bottle”, an expression of Culture, Humanities and Social Sciences, is to create “a unique communication interface between space &amp; earth, and between present &amp; future humankind”.  After its return from ISS on ULF5, the Space Bottle will be displayed in the museum with Shannon’s video message, pictures of the Space Bottle during one of the ULF5 spacewalks (during which one crewmember will “fill” the Bottle with outer space), and a description of the mission background.]
 
 Alex Skvortsov did the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 The CDR also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Tracy, Sasha &amp; Misha again had an hour each set aside for personal crew departure preparations, standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
 CDR, FE-3 &amp; FE-5 were scheduled for their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Alex at ~11:30am, Fyodor at ~2:10pm, Mikhail at ~2:40pm EDT.
 
 At ~6:20am, FE-6 Walker powered up the ISS amateur radio equipment and at 6:25am conducted a ham radio session with students at the University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia.
 
 At ~12:25pm, Tracy, Doug &amp; Shannon participated in a PAO TV event with two interviews of 10 min each, one with the Voice of America (Suzanne Presto), the other with ABC News (Gina Sunseri).
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR/2x, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after the last T2 session of the day but is now regularly being done once a week after the last T2 session.]
 
 Reboost:   A one-burn reboost of ISS is scheduled tomorrow morning at 5:04am EDT using the Progress 39P DPO rendezvous &amp; docking thrusters.  Planned burn duration: 8 min 46 sec; delta-V: 1.2 m/s (3.94 ft/s).  Expected mean altitude gain: 2.1 km (1.13 nmi).  Purpose: Set up phasing for 22S Soyuz landing on 9/23 (eastern) and 24S launch conditions on 10/7.  This reboost along with another in mid-October will set up phasing for 40P Progress launch on 10/27 and a string of consecutive FD3 launch opportunities for STS-133/ULF5 starting on 11/1.  
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Tunis, Tunisia (ISS had a near nadir-viewing pass over this North African capital city.  The city is located on the coast of the Gulf of Tunis and extends along the coastline and into the adjacent hills.  Overlapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural area were requested), Lisbon, Portugal (weather was predicted to be clear over this capital city.  It is the westernmost large city in Europe, and is located on the Atlantic Ocean coastline and the Tagus River.  Overlapping frames of the metropolitan area, taken along track, were requested), Hurricane Igor, Atlantic Ocean (Dynamic Event.  Hurricane Igor has the potential to reach Category 5 strength by the time of this overpass.  Based on the current predicted track of Igor, the crew should have had a near nadir-viewing pass over the center of the storm, providing an opportunity for detailed imagery of the eye wall structure), Mississippi Delta Region (weather was predicted to be clear over the Mississippi Delta.  Overlapping frames, taken along track, were requested to capture the current state of marshes and coastlines in the Delta following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill), and Wetumpka Impact Crater, AL (looking to the right of track for this 6.5 km diameter impact crater.  The crater is a somewhat subtle feature on the landscape located directly to the southeast of the Coosa River.  Overlapping frames of the region were requested to maximize the potential of obtaining imagery of the crater).
