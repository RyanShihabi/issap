ISS On-Orbit Status 05/30/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday –  Crew half-day off.   Ahead: Week 11 of Increment 23.  
 
  At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  FE-1 Skvortsov did the daily morning check on the TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat container and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
  FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued their week-long session of the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s 6<sup>th</sup>, Tracy’s 3<sup>rd</sup>, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Creamer continued his FD180 (Flight Day 180) session of the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) medical protocol, his 5<sup>th</sup> (and last) on board run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test (not sampling) at wake-up.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
  After breakfast, FE-5 Noguchi supported the weekly (every Sunday’s) U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required overnight fast started last night for ~10 hrs with nothing but plain water prior to the dosing and continued for 30 min after swallowing the pill.      [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  In preparation for his return to gravity in three days, CDR Kotov performed Part 1 of his 5<sup>th</sup> &amp; final training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the Russian VELO ergometer, assisted by Kornienko as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  The activity was then closed out.      [The 1.5-hour assessment, supported by ground specialist tagup via VHF (5:42am EDT), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels.  HR (Heart Rate) &amp; BP (Blood Pressure) readings were reported to the ground specialist.  The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of Suraev’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -20, -25, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each, then -25, -30, and -40 mmHg (Torr) for 5 min. each plus 30mmHg for 5 min. while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.  Part 2 will be conducted tomorrow.]
 
  With the protective shutters of the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Lab and Cupola windows closed, CDR Kotov prepared for Tuesday’s Soyuz undocking by spending an hour in the TMA-17 Descent Module (SA) supporting a ground-commanded checkout of the MCS (Motion Control System SUD, Mode 2/“Docked”) which included pressurization of the KDU (Combined Propulsion System) Section 2 and Tank 2, a test of the pilot’s translational hand controller (RUD), and a 1-min hot firing of the DPO braking thrusters (4:09:30am-4:10:30am).  DPO lateral thrusters were not fired.    [For the RST (rasstjkovkoy/undocking) test, station attitude was handed over to Russian thruster control at 4:00am, then back to LVLH XVV (Local Vertical Local Horizontal/x-axis in velocity vector) attitude.  The one-minute firing took place on Daily Orbit 3 during an RGS (Russian Groundsite) pass.  Attitude control was returned to the USOS (U.S. Segment) at 5:03am.]
 
  Later, Kotov, Noguchi &amp; Creamer spent three hours in the 21S spacecraft’s SA Descent Module to conduct the Soyuz descent drill, a standard training exercise for every crew returning on a Soyuz.  The exercise, which strictly forbids any command activation (except for switching the InPU display), was supported by a tagup and discussions with ground instructor at TsUP/Moscow via S-band.      [The session includes a review of the pertinent ODFs (operational data files), specifically the books on Soyuz Ascent &amp; Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situations, crew responsibilities when executing the flight program, visual crew recognition of SUS (Entry Control System) failures, spacesuit procedures, etc., with special emphasis on operations with the Neptune-ME cockpit console.  The training uses a Descent Simulator application on the RSK1 laptop.  During the actual descent, Kotov, as Soyuz CDR, will occupy the middle couch, with Noguchi in the left &amp; Creamer in the right Kazbek couch.   Pending the final State Commission decision at about 3.5h before undocking, 21S return is expected on 6/1 (next Tuesday), Eastern.]
 
  After the 4<sup>th</sup> (and final) activity program for the four-day ATV RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System) testing yesterday, Oleg today terminated the ASN-M Satellite Navigation System testing, disconnecting the RSE1 laptop from the configuration and downlinking the four-day NPM receiver module data via OCA.     [Each program had its own specific batch of settings selected for the three NPM units.  For each activity program, the redundant NPM units were monitored by Oleg for communication status &amp; absence of errors approximately every 2 hrs.  Test duration is four days, and the test started on 5/25.   Background:  The ASN-M will be needed for the proximity operations of the second ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle), expected in December of this year.  For the multipath/interference tests of the ATV RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System) in the current joint ISS-MRM2-Soyuz TMA-18/22S configuration, some station systems had to be powered down (due to reduced power availability from the solar arrays).  The USOS windows were shuttered for the attitude maneuver required to test for multipathing impacts of various SARJ/BGA/TRRJ (Solar Alpha Rotary Joint/Beta Gimbal Assembly/Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint) configurations and possible shadowing of the ASN-M antennas which are used for ATV dockings.  The SARJs were parked during the test, and several parked and autotracking BGA configurations were used.] 
 
  Activities performed by FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson included –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Closing the protective      window shutters of Lab, Kibo &amp; Node-3 Cupola for the 21S thruster      test,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Spending another ~1hr on      unpacking US cargo delivered on the MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Relocating two IWIS RSUs      (Internal Wireless Instrumentation System Remote Sensor Units), by      swapping RSU A (#1028) from the SM (Service Module) to the Lab and RSU B      (#1027) from the SM to the Lab,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Retrieving &amp; gathering      the equipment required tomorrow for CSLM-2 (Coarsening in Solid-Liquid      Mixtures-2) operations, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Conducting a      time-consuming audit/inventory of Water &amp; CWQM (Colorimetric Water      Quality Monitoring) kits (a task that took considerably longer than      allocated on Tracy’s timeline, taking away her free time),</li> </ul> 
  FE-6 Creamer had 30 min set aside for prepacking US return cargo on 21S.
 
  Working in MRM2 Poisk, with FE-1 Skvortsov taking documentary photography, FE-3 Kornienko closed out the Russian BTKh-35 MEMBRANA (Membrane) experiment, removing Kit #1 sample capsules from the thermostatic-controlled container &amp; prepacking them with Kit #2 capsules for return on 21S.  Payload hardware was removed into stowage.     [Objective of Membrane:  study of new technological capabilities to generate a porous structure with a high degree of uniformity of spatial distribution and working pore sizes based on the convection-turbulent-free process of phase changes in microgravity in a polymer solution.  Expected outcome is the production of porous polymeric materials.  These are filtering elements, membranes, sorbents having a high degree of structural homogeneity of working pores, acting as "molecular sieves" and possessing the improved selectivity characteristics (selective rejection) when they are used in the separation processes of complex mixtures of macromolecules.  An example would be during extraction of valuable organic and bioorganic preparations in ground-based production.]
 
  With the Poisk MPI/Multifunction Indicator Panel temporarily deactivated, Alexander Skvortsov performed the periodic Russian SPOPT Fire Detection &amp; Suppression System maintenance in the MRM2, carefully dismantling its three IDZ-2 smoke detectors, cleaning their ionizing needles and then reinstalling the sensors.     [Part of the job is to inspect surrounding areas behind panels and to clean those surfaces with microbial growth wipes.]
 
  Mikhail Kornienko meanwhile performed the periodic calibration &amp; adjustment test of the O<sub>2</sub> sensor of the SM SOGS (Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System) IK0501 gas analyzer (GA), using the BKGA/Gas Analyzer Calibration Assembly and IGZ/Analyzer Status Indicator (constituent meter).     [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2,</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
  FE-3 then completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Misha also conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  Alexander set up &amp; conducted another sun-glint observation session with the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) experiment, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor) from SM window #9 and later downlinking data.     [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.  RUSALKA ops involve calibration and tests of research equipment relating to the Sun and the Earth's limb at sunset (atmosphere lighted).  Being tested are the procedure for remote determination of Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) &amp; Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) content in the atmosphere (in the First Phase), measurement of CH<sub>4</sub> &amp; CO<sub>2</sub> content in the atmosphere and reception of data on NI2 and NI4 content over the territories subjected to natural and technogenic effects, reception of sufficient data on seasonal dependencies of tropospheric parameters being studied (in the Second Phase).  Equipment used:  RUSALKA monoblock, Nikon D2X(s) digital photo camera; AF VR Nikkor ED 80-400f/4.5-5.6D lens with ultraviolet filter, bracket for attachment to the window, and RUSALKA-Accessories set.  Support hardware: Device TIUS DKShG/PNSK, Laptop RSK1, and Software Package loading disk.]
 
  After taking situational photographs of its location at the Spherical Phantom in MRM2 and recording its accumulated data, CDR Kotov dismantled the LULIN-5 detector unit of the RBO-3-2 Matryoshka-R radiation suite and prepared it for return on 21S.
 
  Kotov used the standard ECOSFERA equipment, set up yesterday, to conduct microbial air sampling runs for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment, with the POTOK Air Purification System temporarily powered down, taking Kit 1 samples from cabin surfaces along with samples from crewmembers for sanitation and disease studies.  The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container and subsequently packed for return in Soyuz 21S.  Later, Oleg initiated MO-21 battery recharge for another sampling run tomorrow.     [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.]
 
  For Kotov &amp; Skvortsov, it was time again for recharging the Motorola Iridium-9505A satellite phones located in Soyuz TMA-17/21S (docked at SM Aft) &amp; Soyuz TMA-18/22S (at MRM2), a monthly routine job and Oleg’s 4<sup>th</sup>, Sasha’s 2<sup>nd</sup>.      [After retrieving the phones from their location in the spacecraft Descent Modules (BO), the crewmembers initiated the recharge of the lithium-ion batteries, monitoring the process every 10-15 minutes as it took place.  Upon completion, the phones were returned inside their SSSP Iridium kits and stowed back in the BO’s ODF (operational data files) container.  The satphone accompanies returning ISS crews on Soyuz reentry &amp; landing for contingency communications with SAR (Search-and-Rescue) personnel after touchdown (e.g., after an “undershoot” ballistic reentry, as happened during the 15S return).  The Russian-developed procedure for the monthly recharging has been approved jointly by safety officials.  During the procedure, the phone is left in its fire-protective fluoroplastic bag with open flap.  The Iridium 9505A satphone uses the Iridium constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to relay the landed Soyuz capsule's GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates to helicopter-borne recovery crews.  The older Iridium-9505 phones were first put onboard Soyuz in August 2003.  The newer 9505A phone, currently in use, delivers 30 hours of standby time and three hours of talk, up from 20 and two hours, respectively, on the older units.]
 
  Sasha &amp; Misha had another 2 hrs reserved for more cargo transferring &amp; stowing from MRM1 Rassvet.
 
  FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their pre-descent PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Soichi at ~2:10pm, TJ at ~2:35pm EDT.
 
  FE-1 &amp; FE-5 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sasha at ~7:55am, Soichi at ~5:00am &amp; 12:50pm.
 
  The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).
 
  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
