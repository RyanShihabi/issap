ISS On-Orbit Status 11/15/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
CDR Williams &amp; FE-3 Ford started the day with another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, Suni’s 38<sup>th </sup>(same as Aki), Kevin’s 5<sup>th</sup>.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
After wakeup, FE-1 Novitskiy performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
FE-2 Tarelkin completed the daily reboot of the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops, while FE-4 Malenchenko rebooted the Russian RS1 &amp; RS2 laptops.
 
Yuri, Oleg &amp; Evgeny also conducted the periodic checkup of the circuit breakers &amp; fuses in the MRM1 Rassvet &amp; MRM2 Poisk mini research modules.     [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 &amp; MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.  MRM2 &amp; MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.]
 
Upon wake-up, Kevin Ford swapped out the battery of the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) equipment at the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack, then re-activated the NIKON D2Xs plus software. Battery replacement was performed one more time during the day.    [This is the 5<sup>th</sup> use of the NIKON D2Xs camera by EKAM and the 4<sup>th</sup> time that any images are being taken from the WORF. EKAM will have a week-long session (until 11/17) which started on 11/12 with system checkout and targeting calibration. Students around the world, anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images, will begin taking their images today by remote commanding. D2Xs batteries (3 per day) need to be fully charged for camera operation.]
 
FE-6 Hoshide conducted Part 4 of the periodic noise measurement protocol, collecting the static deployed acoustic dosimeters of the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) from their ISS locations (#1003 in Node-2, #1004 in JPM, #1005 in MRM1) after their 24-hr data take, downloaded the data and stowed the dosimeters after removing &amp; trashing their batteries.
 
After safing the O<sub>2</sub>/Oxygen &amp; N<sub>2</sub>/Nitrogen subsystems in the US A/L (Airlock) by closing three valves on panel OA2 (VL009 for O<sub>2</sub> Lo P, VL010 for O<sub>2</sub> Hi P), VL013 for N<sub>2</sub>), Akihiro completed a ~3.5hr R&amp;R IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the partially rotated F1 rack, removing &amp; replacing the AL2A3B_B RPCM (Remote Power Control Module) which has a failed RPC 6 (controlling the CCAA/(Common Cabin Air Assembly) Water Separator). O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> subsystems were then returned to nominal configuration.     [All GLAs (General Luminaire Assembly) light fixtures and ATUs (Audio Terminal Units) in the A/L were temporarily unpowered by the ground for safing.]
 
With the battery of the Russian TEKh-62 ALBEDO experiment freshly charged in the morning, FE-1 Novitskiy worked with F-4 Malenchenko, as handover, to set up the hardware of ALBEDO’s PSS Photo Spectral System at an SM window for a test of its electronics module and operating system.     [Results were stored on memory card for subsequent downlinking to the ground via OCA.]
 
FE-2 Tarelkin set up the BTKh-43 KONSTANTA payload and performed the 4<sup>th</sup> session of the experiment, with photo/video recording. Data were downlinked to TsUP via RSPI high-speed link.   [Using the Rekomb-K hardware, KONSTANTA aims to identify the effects of the micro-G environment on the activity of a model enzymatic agent with respect to a specific zymolyte by identifying the feasibility of determining enzymatic activity of an isolated cholinesterase specimen in comparison with ground experiments run concurrently and periodic activity tests of the cholinesterase specimen with respect to a specific zymolyte on board the ISS using a method which allows correct calculation of the Michaelis constant.  Purpose: Finding possible approaches to protecting enzyme systems of animals against undesirable effects of spaceflight, as well as determining the feasibility of both spot checks and regular monitoring of biochemical indicators of the crew during spaceflight using enzyme test systems.]
 
In preparation for his return to gravity in three days (along with Williams &amp; Hoshide), Yuri Malenchenko undertook Part 1 of his 5<sup>th</sup> and final exercise/training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the TVIS treadmill, with Evgeny Tarelkin assisting Yuri as CMO (Crew Medical Officer). FE-4 was supported in his one-hour session by ground specialist tagup. Part 2 follows tomorrow.      [The assessment, lasting 90 min, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance after several months in zero-G.  The closeout exercise generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -20, -25, -35, -40 mmHg (Torr) for 5 min. each, followed by -10 mmHg for 1 min., -20, -35, -40 mmHg for 10 min. each, and a final 30 mmHg for 5 min. and drop to 0 mmHg, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure, medically monitored with the Gamma-1M hardware.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
Afterwards, Yuri collected &amp; downloaded the periodic sensor readings of the Russian “Pille-MKS” (MKS = ISS) radiation dosimetry experiment which has 11 sensors placed at various locations in the RS (DC1, SM starboard &amp; port cabin windows, ASU toilet facility, control panel, MRM2, MRM1, etc.) and four in CQs.     [The sensors were cross-calibrated, and the memory/flash card was then replaced.  Today’s readings were taken manually from all 11 deployed dosimeters and logged on a data sheet. The dosimeters were re-deployed at their locations. They take their readings automatically every 90 minutes.]
 
FE-3 Ford performed regular maintenance on the JAXA MOST (Medaka Osteoclast [killifish]) AQH (Aquatic Habitat) Aquariums 1 &amp; 2, testing their water quality using nitrate &amp; nitrite test strips from the Lab MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) Dewar 4 to measure the concentration of ammonium, nitrate and nitrite in water samples from the WCU (Water Circulation Unit) and sup[plying fresh water to the WCU. The test strips were then returned to MELFI-3.
 
Oleg Novitskiy completed the periodic (~monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new spare (#135). The old unit (#134) was discarded as trash and the IMS (Inventory Management System) database updated.        [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
FE-1 also supported the overnight test of the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) in the SM by copying the test data collected overnight from the RSE-SLS A31p laptop to the RSS2 laptop for data downlink and log file dump. Before sleeptime tonight, Oleg will turn on the RSE-LCS laptop again to commence recording for TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communication System).
 
In Node-3, CDR Williams had ~3 hrs set aside for inspecting the CDRA ASV 103 (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly Air Selector Valve 103) in AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) Rack #2 and repairing whichever component was found leaking. FE-3 Ford observed the activities for handover/familiarization.    [The leak was thought to be in one of three places: the valve body, the valve’s aft Hydraflow connector, or the Hydraflow connector on Desiccant Bed 201 associated with Valve 103. For pinpointing the leak, the crew had the ULD (Ultrasonic Leak Detector). Access to the valve required extension of the TCCS (Trace Contaminant Control System).]
 
Aki Hoshide set up the G1 video camcorder, NIKON D2Xs camera and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), gathered the necessary equipment, then conducted the JAXA EPO (Education Payload Operation) “Try Zero-G” demo experiment, taking video &amp; still imagery of ice cubes thawing in microgravity with the D2Xs timer set for sequential shooting. Later, the footage &amp; images were downlinked via MPC.    [The ice cubes were retrieved for the melting demo from MELFI-1 in JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) set at -95 degC.]
 
Yuri had another 3 hrs reserved for packing and stowing return cargo on Soyuz 31S while keeping track of moves in the IMS database.
 
Kevin performed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of continuing WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes, but this time Kevin’s report was “no change” besides what he had already reported down.     [The current card (32-0005H) lists 20 CWCs (288.73 L total), including 1 empty bag, for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (3 CWCs with 98.1 L);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L; plus 1 empty bag);  3. Iodinated water (11 CWCs with 164.45 L); 4. Waste water (1 CWC with 9.68 L bag EMU waste water), and 5. Special Fluid (OGS) (1 CWC with 2.5 L). Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
Novitskiy deinstalled 12 ID-3MKS dosimeter assemblies of the RBO-3-2 Matryoshka-R radiation payload from their exposure locations in the SM and transferred them to Soyuz 31S for return to Earth. Documentary imagery was to be downlinked to TsUP-Moscow via OCA or RSPI.
 
Sunita Williams worked on the EWIS (External Wireless Instrumentation System), power cycling the NCU (Network Control Unit) by turning its switch off &amp; on to recover functionality.
 
Afterwards, Suni continued the job of preparing Ice Brick units for upcoming preservative storage needs, today retrieving 4 green (-32 degC) Bricks from stowage and inserting them in MELFI-3 Dewar 1 in the Lab for chill-down.
 
Tarelkin undertook the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from 2 CWCs (#1087, #1088) to the RS (Russian Segment) for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container. Once filled, the EDV is connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.]
 
Ford continued the currently ongoing upgrading of JSL (Joint Station Local Area Network) by deploying the new BelAir WAPs (Wireless Access Points) in Node-1 &amp; Node-2.     [In Node-1, Kevin relocated SSC4 (Station Support Computer 4) connection from the NetGear WAP to UIP (Utility Interface Panel), turned off power to the NetGear WAP and powered on the new BelAir WAP instead so that the ground could upload a new configuration file to allow it to function as the new WAP. FE-3 then repeated the procedure in Node-2.] 
 
In preparation for upcoming sessions with the Russian MedOps SZM-MO-21 ECOSFERA equipment, FE-2 Tarelkin initiated charging on the Ecosphere power pack (BP) and set up the refrigerator.     [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger, power supply unit, and incubation tray for Petri dishes, determines microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge at one given time, the sample collection must be performed in two stages.]
 
Evgeny also took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Oleg completed the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Kevin conducted his 2<sup>nd</sup> session with the RFx (Reversible Figures) experiment payload in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), first adjusting the VCA1 (Video Cameras Assembly 1) for coverage, then connecting the RFx hardware to the ESA MPLT (Multipurpose Payload Laptop), followed  by performance of the science protocol in free-floating position.  Session data were then copied to PCMCIA memory card, and the hardware stowed.      [RFx is an ESA experiment designed to investigate the adaptive nature of the human neuro-vestibular system in the processing of gravitational information related to 3D visual perception. Previous research suggests that the reliance on linear perspective cues for three dimensional visual perception decreases when subjects are tilted relative to gravity and in microgravity during parabolic and orbital flight. Based on this observation, it is likely that the adaptive changes in the processing of gravitational information by the neuro-vestibular system during spaceflight may alter 3D visual perception. The RFx (Reversible Figures) investigation involves comparisons of pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight perceptions with regards to ambiguous perspective-reversible figures to assess the influence of micro-G. The question is whether the perception of ambiguous perspective-reversible figures (figures that can normally be seen in 1g to change in perspective or orientation in two different ways) is affected by micro-G. A comparison of the perceived reversals during visualization of the figures in crewmembers occurs before, during and after long-term exposure to microgravity.  It is expected that measurable, perceptual differences can expand our understanding of human cognitive-perception dynamics by examining the differences that exist between the micro-G environment of the ISS and that of the Earth’s surface. The hypothesis that the perceived reversal of 2D figures is not affected in micro-G is to be verified by determining for all phases of the spaceflight: (1) the time for first reversal and the number of perceived reversals of 3D and 2D reversible figures in a given time frame; and (2) the probability for seeing each view/reversal within a figure.]
 
Oleg performed his 2<sup>nd</sup> collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.     [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
FE-1 also worked on Progress 49P (#417), continuing its unloading and transfer of deliveries to the ISS for stowage, logging moves in the IMS database.
 
Evgeny Tarelkin had ~1h15m reserved for using the SONY HVR-Z7E video camera to film onboard scenes for Roskosmos TV Studio’s joint project with News Channel “Russia 24”, producing its weekly program on cosmonautics.
 
Yuri &amp; Suni again had an hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which is standard pre-return procedure for homecoming crewmembers.
 
At ~5:50am EST, Evgeny &amp; Oleg supported a Russian PAO TV event, recording video footage for downlink to greet (1) the Moscow M. A. Sholokhov Cossacks Cadet Corps on its 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary, and (2) G.G. Raikunov on his upcoming 60<sup>th</sup> birthday.     [(1) Moscow Mikhail Alexandrovich Sholokhov Cadet Corps is turning 10 years old. The Cossack Cadet Corps continues traditions of Cadet Corps education. Its students are boys from grade 5 to 11. The main component of instructional and education process is based on maintaining historic, cultural, and spiritual traditions of Russian Cossacks. Cossacks, with their way of life based on principles of democracy, selfless service to their Motherland and nation, sacrifice in the name of friendship, became an example to follow by students and employees of the Corps within the walls of the institution. (2) On 12/3, Gennadiy Gennadiyevich Raikunov, General Director of the TsNIIMash Federal State Unitary Enterprise will be 60 years old. Gennadiy Gennadiyevich is a Doctor of Science, Professor, recipient of RF Presidential Award in Science and Technology, RF Honored Scientist, Honored Mechanical Engineer, Honored Space Test Engineer, vice-President of K. E. Tsiolkovskiy Russian Academy of Cosmonautics, Chairman of Coordination Science and Engineering Committee under the Federal Space Agency for Applied Science and Experiments in manned space complexes. He is a scientist and a lead manager in the area of system analysis, flight ballistic support, development of space rocket systems, socio-economic and strategic military facilities, information technologies for remote probing of Earth from space.] 
 
At ~11:45am, Suni &amp; Kevin supported a PAO Educational TV event, addressing students and other participants at an event at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.    [In attendance were the Deputy Education Secretary Tony Miller; Moderator Mike Hulslander; and students from Kindergarden to 12<sup>th</sup> grade.] 
 
At ~12:42pm, Suni &amp; Kevin conducted the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
Before Presleep (~2:30pm EST), Suni powers up the MPC and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turns MPC routing off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4/2x, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2).     [CDR &amp; FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed ARED/TVIS (cont.), with T2 (int., 4 min.), none, ARED/T2 (cont.) and T2 (2 min) for the next 4 days. Aki’s protocol for today showed TVIS (int. 4 min.), with ARED/T2 (cont.), T2 (int. 2 min.) and ARED/CEVIS on the following 3 days.  Explanation: After 10 min. warmup (active, i.e., motorized): Aerobic “T2 30 sec” (passive, i.e., nonmotorized) = 7-8 sets of exercise at HRmax (max. heart rate) for 30 sec, with 15 sec rest in between.  Aerobic “T2 2 min” (motorized) = 6 sets of 2 min each at 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 90%, 80% HRmax.  Aerobic “T2 4 min” (motorized) = 4 sets of 4 min, with 3 min rest period in between. ]
 
Soyuz TMA-05M/31S Thruster Test:  Before sleeptime tonight, Kevin will close the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola &amp; Kibo JPM shutters to prevent their contamination from effluents of the Soyuz 31S thruster test scheduled for tonight at 12:32am-12:50am EST. For the testing, ISS attitude control authority will be handed over to Russian MCS (Motion Control System) at 12:27am and returned to US CMG (Control Moment Gyroscope) momentum management at 1:10am. The test will be conducted by Yuri Malenchenko &amp; Sunita Williams from the Soyuz SA (Descent Module), for which Yuri &amp; Suni will start their day 90 minutes earlier (wakeup: 11:30pm tonight) and begin their sleeptime tomorrow at 3:00pm instead of at 4:30pm. 
 
T2/COLBERT Failure:   The T2 advanced treadmill exerciser has failed, probably due to broken data connectivity in the DAU (Data Avionics Unit). The most likely cause of the T2 failure was powering off T2 during a data transfer. T2 troubleshooting by Aki is scheduled tomorrow. Until the machine is restore to service, the TVIS treadmill in the RS will take over its aerobic function, with Russian agreement.
 
Conjunction Notice:   NASA Flight controllers and Russian Ballistics experts are preparing for an upcoming conjunction with Object 81662 (Unknown) tomorrow (11/16) at 12:54pm EST. The official Go/NoGo for DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) preparations has been made, due to a PC (Probability of Collision) of 5.21E-04 (5.21 x 10<sup>-4</sup>) shown by the last tracking update, i.e. currently a RED threshold violation. The DAM TIG (Time of Ignition) will occur tomorrow 10:16am EST.
 
Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.</li></ul> 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) target uplinked for today were Brahmaputra River Sand Bars-East sector, India (Nadir pass. Shooting from nadir left and right as ISS crossed the Brahmaputra River. Even more of the sand bars may now be visible than in recent CEO imagery as the dry season progresses), Damascus, Syria (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  Looking right for the Syrian capital [population ~1.8 million], located about 50 miles inland from the Mediterranean Sea. As this is a relatively small city, CEO staff requested use of the 400 mm lens. Damascus is a low-contrast urban area on the western edge of a dark area of intensive agriculture), New York, New Jersey, Connecticut Coastlines (INTERNATIONAL DISASTER CHARTER.  Looking right of track for views of all the affected coastlines), Kingstown, St. Vincent and the Grenadines (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  Near nadir pass:  looking just right of nadir at the farther end of the large island [as seen from ISS] for this capital city of ~25,000. The small size of the city requires a more detailed image. The southern tip of the island is the crew’s visual cue), and St. Georges, Grenada (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  Looking right of track on the south end of the island of Grenada for this small capital city [population ~33,700]. For scale, the entire island of Grenada is only 33 km long).
