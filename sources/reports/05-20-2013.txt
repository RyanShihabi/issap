New Status: 



Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus (MDCA) Hardware Replacement: On May 16, Combustion Integration Rack (CIR) experienced a failed igniter in the combustion chamber. Further test points could not be accomplished until it was replaced. Today, FE-3 Cassidy reviewed procedures, gathered hardware, accessed the CIR Combustion Chamber and removed the MDCA Chamber Insert Assembly (CIA) from the Chamber. He then replaced the MDCA Fuel Reservoir in Location 1 and both MDCA igniter tips and re-installed the MDCA CIA in the Chamber.



Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System (TVIS) Removal: CDR Vinogradov and FE-2 Misurkin removed TVIS and temporarily stowed it in the KAYUTA (Russian sleep quarters) in preparation for the new Russian Treadmill (BD-2) installation and checkout over the next 3 days. Crew is waiting until BD-2 is installed and operational before disassembling TVIS.
Removed Photo Voltaic Thermal Control System (PVTCS) PFCS Status: The Pump Flow Control System (PFCS) that was removed during US Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 21 on May 11, 2013, continued to show a steady leak rate after the EVA. Over the weekend the removed PFCS accumulator quantity fell to 0%. Ground controllers will uplink updated Pre-Positioned Load (PPLs) later today to allow PVTCS automated safing to be re-enabled on Tuesday. Ground controllers expect to reactivate Channel 2B Electrical Power System (EPS) hardware on Wednesday.
ISS Conjunction Threat: The ground was preparing for a possible ISS Debris Avoidance Maneuver (DAM) in response to a conjunction threat from object Kondor-E 1 Observation Satellite. Last night, the Probability of Collision (PC) was in the red threshold. At this time, the trend has gone to green and ground teams are standing down on previous DAM planning.
