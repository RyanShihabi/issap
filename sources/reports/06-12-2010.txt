ISS On-Orbit Status 06/12/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – crew rest day.   Today is “Russia Day” (Den’ Rossii), Russia’s National Holiday, established by Boris Yeltsin to celebrate national unity after the Russian parliament in 1990 formally declared its sovereignty, with large crowds in Red Square in Moscow, extending to Monday, 6/14. 
  
  At wake-up, CDR Skvortsov conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  The three residents performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the uborka house cleaning, the CDR conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  FE-3 Kornienko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson conducted the T+5 day visual microbial (bacterial &amp; fungal) analysis &amp; data recording of surface samples collected by her on 6/7 on SSK (Surface Sample Kit) slides.     [The colony growth on the sampling slides is inspected visually after five days of incubation, using a special procedure to analyze the SSK media slides for bacterial &amp; fungal colony growths.]
 
  Working off the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, Sasha Skvortsov completed a session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the Nikon D3X.
 
  Also as a discretionary task, Misha Kornienko conducted another photography run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera (with SIGMA AF 300-800mm telelens) of the Amur estuary and the Kuril Islands.
 
  At ~7:45am EDT, Mikhail Kornienko had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
  At ~10:10am, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  Tracy, Misha &amp; Sasha completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).
 
 Elektron Failure:   The Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator failed unexpectedly last night at 5:44pm EDT (under investigation).  With a current ppO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure O<sub>2</sub>) of 159.75 mmHg, nominal crew metabolic rates (1.77 mmHg/day ppO<sub>2</sub> decay for 3 persons) and ISS volume of 820 cubic meter (28,959 cubic feet), ppO<sub>2</sub> would be at 148.9 mmHg at Soyuz 23S hatch opening (minimum flight rule limit = 146 mmHg).  After 23S hatch opening, the 146 mmHg limit would be reached after another ~19 hrs (6/18, 5:00pm). Besides stored oxygen, there is also a large supply of SFOG (Solid-Fuel Oxygen Generator) “candles” on board (Russian: TGK).
