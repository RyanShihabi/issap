ISS On-Orbit Status 03/09/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
After breakfast, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
After wakeup, CDR Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers &amp; FE-6 Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 34<sup>th</sup> for Dan, the 28<sup>th</sup> for André &amp; Don.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Anton Shkaplerov conducted his 4<sup>th</sup> MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) test, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, along with PZEh-MO-8 body mass measurement using the IM device.       [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM, the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with Anton’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.]
 
FE-6 Pettit underwent his 3<sup>rd</sup> (FD75) ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Resting Echo Scan in the US Lab, assisted by André Kuipers who served as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) to operate the USND (Ultrasound) scans, later transfer the data and then stow the USND equipment.  Dan Burbank took documentary photographs.       [Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable &amp; VOX (voice-operated space-to-ground mike), Don took the USND scan for ICV assessment, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera.  Heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor).  There are dietary constraints, and no exercise is allowed 4 hrs prior to scan.  After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed.  Later, the data from the two HM-2 (Holter Monitor 2) HiFi Cards and two Actiwatch Spectrums were transferred from the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) hard drive to the USND-2 USB drive.  Voice required last 5 minutes for crew to inform ground copy process is complete.  The USND echo experiment uses the Image Collector software on the laptop and requires VOX/Voice plus RT Video downlink during the activity.  Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).]
 
After configuring the G1 camcorder for ground observation of his IFM (Inflight Maintenance) activities, Dan Burbank reviewed uplinked procedures and set up the CR #2 (Catalytic Reactor 2) which he had removed from the Node-3 WRS1 (Water Recovery System 1) rack, in the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) for inspection and stowage preparation.    [Activities involved partially taking it apart by removing the top thermal cover and inspecting inside for leaked water in an attempt to locate the suspected leak.  To prepare the CR for stowage and retain the option for a future repair and re-installation, Dan took steps to preserve the internal sterile barrier to help protect the catalyst bed against microbial growth while in stowage at ambient temperatures.  He also protected against thermal expansion while the ORU (On-orbit Replacement Unit) is stowed, by slightly “cracking” two QDs (quick disconnects) at its rear and covering the gaps with cleanroom tape.  His inspection will give ground teams data to assess whether the old CR can be reused on-orbit.]
 
Closing out the WRS1 IFM, Burbank removed the temporary filter kit between the new CR and the MCV (Microbial Check Valve), used yesterday for the loop scrub run by ground control to flush the new ORU, and finished by cleaning up the rack.  
 
FE-5 Kuipers later re-stowed the tools &amp; equipment used for the WRS recovery.
 
FE-4 Kononenko set up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM window #9 for another 1h 50m sun-glint observation session, using the bracket-mounted spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor) for unattended ops, synchronized with the coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloaded the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.        [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.]
 
After charging its battery in the morning, Anton Shkaplerov &amp; Anatoly Ivanishin worked ~2 hrs with the KPT-2 payload with its BAR science instruments suite, first measuring air flow with the TTM-2 in the area of the FOTON-GAMMA instrumentation (panel 307), then taking temperature &amp; humidity readings with Iva-6A in the RS &amp; MRM2 work environment atmosphere, and measuring temperature with Piren-V on MRM2 structural elements (e.g., windows &amp; hatch rubber seals.         [Problem area monitoring is necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data were copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities were supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
In support of the subsequent SLICE activities by Don Pettit, André Kuipers performed a visual inspection of the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility and activated it.
 
FE-6 Pettit configured the SLICE (Structure &amp; Liftoff In Combustion Experiment) pyrometry hardware and performed the 7<sup>th</sup> flame test operation, today a (repeated) test run with 100% ethane to determine smoke points.  Later, FE-6 ran the flame tests two more times, each with a new burner installed.  MSG was then deactivated by André.       [To date, ~10 successful tests at ~55 flow conditions have been run. The research goal is to gain unique data to extend scientists’ predictive capability.  Earth application: Increased efficiency and reduced pollutant emission for practical combustion devices, improved numerical modeling, hence improved design tools, hence improved practical combustion on Earth (currently, the good modeling-experiment agreement breaks down when flames are lean or heavily sooting).  Measurements: still images (with camera that was blackbody calibrated for pyrometry), video &amp; radiometer.  Hardware:  SLICE is conducted in the MSG using the SPICE hardware.]
 
André conducted his weekly task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space.
 
Dan filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), his 15<sup>th</sup>.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
Anton continued the extensive inventory/audit (begun on 3/2) of all photo &amp; video equipment in the SM, including accessories, based on the IMS (Inventory Management System) data base, taking pictures of the equipment and making a list of hardware which in his opinion is not used.  The images and filled-out table were then downlinked.
 
FE-1 also took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur),
 
Anatoly meanwhile handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Following up on his CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodinated) audit/inventory on 3/7, André responded to uplinked questions from the ground related to differences between the latest crew count of location and quantities of eight bags and the respective console logs on the ground.     [FE-6 sent down a crew note with the current locations of specific CWCs and their CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags),- #1072, #2026, #2078, #2074, #1012, #2010, #2049, #1011, #2014.]
 
Burbank had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
Anton &amp; Anatoly had 1h 25m reserved for another round of filming more “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY camcorder.  This is part of the ongoing effort to create a photo &amp; video documentary database on the flight of ISS-30 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz &amp; Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.]
 
André Kuipers spent ~1.5 hrs on the second part of cleaning up the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) “corridor”.      [The task concerns the relocation of some hardware from PMM rack fronts to PMM lockers/bays or other USOS (US Segment), organizing empty CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) and restowing hardware into the PMM endcone.  It is estimated to require ~ 5 hrs total.] 
 
Oleg Kononenko had 2 hrs set aside for more loading of excessed equipment &amp; trash on Progress 46P, to be disposed of by incineration during atmospheric reentry on 4/29.
 
Wearing protective gloves and goggles, Oleg very carefully packed the E-K pre-treat container and its RU-5 hose, removed previously from the SM’s ASU toilet facility, for subsequent disposal on Progress 46P.      [When filled, E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid), CrO<sub>3</sub> (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H<sub>2</sub>O (water).  The toxic pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.
 
Anatoly Ivanishin continued the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, today working in the MRM1 Rassvet module replacing the SKPF1 &amp; SKPF2 dust filter cartridges and cleaning the TsV1 fan screen behind panels 205, 207, 208.
 
Later tonight, Dan Burbank will disconnect the LTL (Low Temperature Loop) jumper on the CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) in Node-3 in support of its long-term deactivation.      [Yesterday, the Node-3 CDRA experienced another fault when its ASV 3 (Air Selector Valve 3) failed during a channel transition. Specialists were able to restart the CDRA after two attempts and it continued scrubbing CO<sub>2</sub> from the ISS atmosphere. The Lab CDRA is also operational.]
 
FE-1 &amp; FE-2 had reserve time blocked out on their timelines for Systems Operations, Anton 40 min, Anatoly 60 min.
 
Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
At ~6:45am EST, André performed the weekly ESA crew conference via phone with COL-CC at Oberpfaffenhofen/Germany. 
 
At ~2:10pm, the crew was scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]
 
Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko &amp; Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
