ISS On-Orbit Status 04/22/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Crew off duty.  Ahead:  Week 22 of Increment 30 (six-person crew).
 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Yest kasaniya!    At 10:36am, Progress M-15M/47P (#415) docked successfully to the DC1 (Docking Compartment) nadir port under precise automatic Kurs control.       [Kurs antenna retraction was nominal.  Kasaniya (contact) was followed by a final DPO post-contact thrusting burn, docking probe retraction and sborka (hook closure) after motion damp-out while the ISS was in free drift for 20 min.  At “hooks closed” signal, RS (Russian Segment) MCS returned to active attitude control, maneuvering the ISS to LVLH TEA (local vertical/local horizontal Torque Equilibrium Attitude).  Attitude control authority had been handed over to Russian MCS (Motion Control System); it returned to US Momentum Management later.  Next came the standard 1-hr leak checking, opening of the hatches between DC1 &amp; SU vestibule and SU &amp; Progress and installation of the BZV screw clamps, followed by the standard air sampling inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M air sampler, then powering down the spacecraft and installation of the ventilation/heating air duct, taking photographs of the internal docking surfaces for subsequent downlinking, and dismantling &amp; removing the StM docking mechanism between the cargo ship and the DC1 nadir port.  The craft delivered 902 kg (1988 lbs) of propellant, 50 kg (110 lbs) of oxygen &amp; air, 420 kg (926 lbs) of water, and 1226 kg (2703 lbs) of dry cargo (spare parts &amp; experiment hardware), totaling ~2.6 tons.  47P has improved MMOD (Micrometeoroid/Orbital Debris) shielding that increases the probability of no penetration (PNP).  Additional upgrades will be implemented starting with Progress 57P.  When both upgrades are complete (on 57P and later vehicles), the vehicle 15-year PNP will be 0.9492 (if docked at SM Aft port) and 0.9160 (at DC1 Nadir port).  Progress 47P also carries new Kurs-NA equipment for a post-undock flight test.  The new Kurs system is lighter and uses 2-3 times less power. Its new antenna will not require retraction during docking. To test the system, 47P will undock on 7/22, perform a complete re-rendezvous from ~400 km, then re-dock using the new Kurs-NA on July 24.  Final undocking for reentry will be on or about 7/30.] </li></ul> 
Automated approach &amp; docking was monitored from the SM by FE-1 Shkaplerov &amp; FE-4 Kononenko on the TORU manual teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system in case automated control was aborted.
 
After the cargo ship’s docking, Anton &amp; Oleg shut off the TORU, and reconfigured the STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to normal ops.     [The "Voskhod-M" STTS enables telephone communications between the SM, FGB, DC-1 and USOS, and also with users on the ground over VHF channels selected by an operator at an SM comm panel, via STTS antennas on the SM’s outside.  There are six comm panels in the SM with pushbuttons for accessing any of three audio channels, plus an intercom channel.  Other modes of the STTS include telegraphy (teletype), EVA voice, emergency alarms, Packet/Email, and TORU docking support].
 
The Russian Flight Engineers then started the standard one-hour leak checking of the docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and the DC1 SU vestibule.
 
Later, Shkaplerov &amp; Kononenko opened the hatches and installed the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling.
 
Afterwards, Oleg powered down the spacecraft and installed the ventilation/heating air duct, while Anatoly took the standard air samples inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M air sampler.
 
Anton Shkaplerov, Anatoly Ivanishin &amp; Oleg Kononenko were allowed ~1.5 hrs more sleep in the morning (3:30am) for tonight’s delay in their sleeptime of 1.5 hrs (7:00pm) to unload time-critical biotechnology experiments from Progress.
 
Before the docking, after breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
FE-2 Ivanishin downloaded the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the docking with the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer of the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.     [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.]
 
With Ivanishin taking documentary photography, Kononenko unloaded the time-critical biotechnology payloads and transferred them to the ISS and their thermostat-controlled containers, specifically –
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>BTKh-40 BIF, to KRIOGEM-03 cooler (+4 degC);
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>BTKh-14 BIOEMULSIYA, to KRIOGEM-03 (+4 degC);
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>BIO-1 POLYGENE, and
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>BTKh-6,7 ARIL/OChB to KRIOGEM-03 cooler (+4 degC).
 
Upon wakeup, CDR Dan Burbank, FE-5 André Kuipers &amp; FE-6 Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 42<sup>nd</sup> for Dan, the 36<sup>th</sup> for André &amp; Don.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
André Kuipers started his workday with Day 4 of his current suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  In addition to recording his diet input, André began the associated 24-hr urine collections and later set up the equipment for the blood sampling which follows tomorrow.       [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD370, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15<sup>th</sup> day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 &amp; 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
In preparation for Progress 47P arrival, Oleg Kononenko set up the Ku-band video “scheme” for a 1.5-hr communications test of converting the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band from SM &amp; Node-3/Cupola, for downlinking as MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoded “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.         [Steps included connecting the SM TVS (television system) to the T61p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop at the SM CP (Central Post), activating Soyuz TVS, turning on MPEG-2 video Server 2, and monitoring the SM’s TV signal from the ground (Moscow) via Ku-band and the Cupola RWS.  The analog signal version of the digital Ku-band downlink is sent to TsUP-Moscow via ESA Gateway at COL-CC (Columbus Orbital Laboratory Control Center) on a Tandberg Decoder.  Afterwards, Satoshi turned Server 2 off for the time being.]
 
Later, Don Pettit reconfigured the wireless SSCs (Station Support Computers) to nominal after they had been switched temporarily to wired operation since the TV MPEG2 multicasting causes transmission outage on wireless SSCs (Station Support Computers) on board.
 
For the 47P docking, Dan Burbank closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and JPM science windows and also temporarily turned off the amateur/ham radio equipment to prevent RF interference with Progress radio.  Later, the ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera) window in the Lab was opened again and the amateur radio equipment re-activated.
 
After the docking, the CDR powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and opened the Lab. Cupola &amp; JPM window shutters.
 
Anatoly completed the periodic (~monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new spare.  (Done last: 3/12).  The old unit was discarded as trash and the IMS updated.       [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
Ivanishin also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.      [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1/2x, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4),     [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for CEVIS.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] 
 
CDR &amp; FE-5 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), André at ~3:40pm, Dan at ~5:20pm EDT.  André had a PSC (Private Special Conference) at ~10:00am EDT.
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
