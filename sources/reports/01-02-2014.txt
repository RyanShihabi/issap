Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) Survey: Ground specialists performed a survey of the AMS payload using the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) video cameras. This imagery will be used as a tool to note any degradation and help diagnose future AMS payload operations anomalies. The previous AMS survey was performed one year ago.
Ocular Health (OH) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Test and Fundoscope Examination:  Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Wakata, acting as Crew Medical Officer (CMO), performed an OCT test on FE-3 Hopkins. Wakata then conducted a Fundoscope eye examination with remote guidance from ground experts. The OCT and Fundoscope activities are part of the Flight Day 90 session for Hopkins. The Ocular Health protocol is a systematic gathering of physiological data to characterize the risk of microgravity-induced visual impairment / intracranial pressure in ISS crewmembers.  Researchers believe the measurement of visual, vascular and central nervous system changes over the course of this experiment and during the subsequent post flight recovery will assist in the development of countermeasures, clinical monitoring strategies and clinical practice guidelines.
Nanoracks Biorack Centrifuge Troubleshooting: Mastrocchio successfully performed troubleshooting on the Nanoracks Biorack Centrifuge in order to complete checkout operations. This follows Hopkins’ attempt in November to perform power up and checkout which were unsuccessful.  Ground teams assisted in the troubleshooting while monitoring live over-the-shoulder high definition video of the activity.
