Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix System (SpaceDRUMS):  Virts and Cristoforetti had difficulty with a leaking Quick Disconnect (QD) during removal of SpaceDRUMS hardware for return on the SpaceX-5 vehicle.  Completion of this task has been postponed while the Ground team develops procedures to address the issue and allow removal of the hardware. The crewmembers removed vent closeout panels and installed four EXPRESS rack lockers. The goal of SpaceDRUMS is to provide a suite of hardware capable of facilitating containerless advanced materials science, including combustion synthesis and fluid physics.
Dragon Offset Grapple On-Board Training (OBT):  In preparation for SpaceX-5 arrival next Thursday, January 8th, Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) in the Hot Backup Configuration and maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) into position for the 3rd Offset Grapple Practice Session.   The USOS crew then practiced grappling the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) Power & Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF).  They repeated this ~5 times and then performed a final run during which the Robotics Ground Controllers safed the SSRMS to simulate a failure.  The crew recovered by switching from the Cupola Robotic Workstation (RWS) to the Lab RWS and backed the SSRMS away.   After the Offset Grapples Practice session, the Robotics Ground Controllers maneuvered the SSRMS to the SpaceX-5 High Hover position and successfully repeated some pre-launch checkouts of the arm.  Several comm error messages observed late in the day are thought to be due to MSS commands being sent simultaneous with a C&C file transfer activity.  MSS ops completed nominally while the C&C file transfer activity was stopped.  MSS performance today was otherwise nominal.
Advanced Resistance Exercise Device (ARED) Set Screw Torque: Virts torqued multiple set screws within the ARED cylinder flywheels and the main arm fasteners.
