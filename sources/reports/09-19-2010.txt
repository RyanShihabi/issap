ISS On-Orbit Status 09/19/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday.   Ahead: Week 16 of Increment 24.
 
 CDR Skvortsov conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Upon wakeup, FE-6 Shannon Walker &amp; FE-4 Doug Wheelock performed their 2<sup>nd</sup> liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol.       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
 Skvortsov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 In the DC1 Docking Compartment, Kornienko performed the daily temperature check on the TBU temperature-controlled incubator with its BTKh-26 CASCADE samples and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson &amp; Shannon Walker took time out for an in-depth review of uplinked procedures for tomorrow’s scheduled transfer of science samples from MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2) to the ER2 GLACIER (Express Rack 2 / General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator).     [The moves will involve blood &amp; urine samples plus experiment specimen from the Ferulate and Genara payloads, using one double Coldbag and two Icepac belts from MELFI-1.]
 
 Jobs listed for Skvortsov &amp; Yurchikhin today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for 19 photo targets specified on an uplinked list,</li><li>A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, </li><li>A ~15-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining NIKON D3 photos with Nikkor 80-200 mm lens and the SONY HD video camcorder on oceanic water blooms in the central-eastern Atlantic areas, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, and</li><li>The periodic inspection of RS (Russian Segment) windows to identify any deterioration of condition compared to the inspection results from previous expeditions (new caverns, scratches, spots or blurs affecting the glass transparency or further aggravation of older defects), in the SM (##1, 2, 5 ,13, 14, 26), DC1 (VL1/EV hatch 1, VL2/EV hatch 2) and MRM2 (VL1, VL2). </li> </ul> 
 CDR, FE-2, FE-4 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Alex at ~6:35am, Wheels at ~10:35am,Tracy at ~12:00pm, Shannon at ~1:50pm EDT.
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-4), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3/2x, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-6) and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after the last T2 session of the day but is now regularly being done once a week after the last T2 session.]
 
 No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
