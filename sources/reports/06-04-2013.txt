Environmental Health System (EHS) Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA) R&R: Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Parmitano and FE-6 Nyberg removed the expired TOCA Protoflight Unit (PFU1) from the Water Recovery System (WRS) 1 rack face and installed a new TOCA PFU2. Nyberg then conducted a WRS sample analysis, recorded the data and transferred it to the Ground.
Z1 Dome Stowage Activities: Parmitano and Nyberg cleared stowage from the Node 1 overhead to access Z1. Parmitano removed items that are needed for the upcoming USOS Extravehicular Activities (EVAs), currently scheduled for July 2013, as well as items to be trashed or returned. Following the removal of hardware, cargo not required for near-term operations was transferred and stowed in the Z1 dome, as ingress only occurs every few years.
Binary Colloidal Alloy Test – Canada 1 (BCAT-C1): FE-3 Cassidy unstowed the slow growth sample module, installed it on a flat surface and pre-mixed a sample for an as yet to be determined future run of the experiment.  The BCAT-C1 experiment studies nano-scale particles dispersed in liquid, known as a colloidal suspension, commonly found in such commercial commodities as paint, electronic polishing compounds and food products. These suspensions have the unique property that the particles phase separate (like oil and water) and the particles self-assemble into crystals that interact strongly with light (like opal). Photographing these samples in microgravity allows the measurement of these processes while avoiding the effects of particle sinking due to gravity. This study allows the development of new insights into this important material process.
