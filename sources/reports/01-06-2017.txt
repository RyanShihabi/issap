Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #38: The crew opened the Airlock External Hatch at 6:22am CST and performed US EVA #38 (Lithium Ion Battery Remove & Replace (R&R) EVA #1). The Phase Elapsed Time (PET) of the EVA was 6 hours and 32 minutes. The EVA was required to install adapter plates and relocate Channel 3A Nickel Hydride (NiH2) batteries to prepare for installation of new Lithium Ion batteries. The crew completed all of the objectives for the EVA:

Stow Node 3 Shields on Airlock
Retrieve Adapter Plate A and B from the Exposed Pallet (EP)
Install Adapter Plate A in Slot 6
Relocate NiH2 Battery 4 to Adapter Plate A
Install Adapter Plate B in Slot 4
Relocate NiH2 Battery 2 to Adapter Plate B
Fasten H1 bolt on the Li-Ion battery in Slot 1
Retrieve and Install Adapter Plate C in Slot 2
Channel 1A Battery Prep

Additionally, the crew was able to perform two get-ahead tasks. They took photographs of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), and retrieved a failed Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) Light from the S3 truss, and routed a Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MDM) Ethernet cable along Node 1.
