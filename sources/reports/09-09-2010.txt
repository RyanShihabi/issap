ISS On-Orbit Status 09/09/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   More Medical &amp; Science.
 
 At wake-up, CDR Alex Skvortsov conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Also at day’s begin, Skvortsov terminated his 12<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, FE-4 Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker continued their week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 4<sup>th</sup> for Doug &amp; Shannon, 8<sup>th</sup> for Tracy, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Walker powered up the CFE (Capillary Flow Experiment) equipment and then had about 1.5 hrs set aside to run fluid tests with the ICF1 (Interior Corner Flow 1) hardware.       [The experiment was recorded on Mini-DVCAM tapes and downlinked in real time, with the first 15 min to verify the camera's field of view and to ensure the Dry Surface Test was being recorded at MCC-Houston since this step was not repeatable.   The experiment was then terminated, the hardware torn down and everything put back in stowage.  CFE has applications to the management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.  ICF is one of three CFE experiments, the others being Vane Gap (VG) and Contact Line (CL).  Each of the CFE experiments is represented with two unique experimental units (1,2), all of which use similar fluid-injection hardware, have simple and similarly sized test chambers, and rely solely on video for highly quantitative data.  Silicone oil is the fluid used for all the tests, with different viscosities depending on the unit.  Differences between units are primarily fluid properties, wetting conditions, and test cell cross section.]
 
 Afterwards, Shannon continued her support of the SAME (Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment) payload in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) and starting up the next (15<sup>th</sup>) run of the SAME (Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment).      [Steps included powering up the MLC (MSG Laptop Computer) and changing out the SAME sample in the carousel (with all 6 preloaded carousels processed, the individual samples on each carousel now need exchanging), the thermal precipitator, followed by opening vent &amp; GN<sub>2</sub> (gaseous nitrogen) valves for ground-controlled operation. The MSG tape is exchanged after every second carousel is processed.   After a ~8 hr run, FE-6 performed the scheduled shutdown of the experiment.  SAME measures smoke properties, or particle size distribution, of typical particles from spacecraft fire smokes to provide data to support requirements for smoke detection in space and identify ways to improve smoke detectors on future spacecraft.  SAME is the successor to the CSD (Comparative Soot Diagnostics) experiment that flew aboard STS-75 in 1996.  That experiment showed that smoke produced in microgravity is different from smoke produced in normal gravity (micro-G smoke particles are larger).]
 
 For the Russian biotechnical experiment BTKh-26 KASKAD (Cascade), FE-3 Kornienko first set up the GB (Glovebox-X) in the MRM2 Poisk module, making electrical connections and briefly powering it up; then he configured the KASKAD payload in the DC1 Docking Compartment with its KT Thermostatic Enclosure, BUP Power Conditioning Unit and TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostatic Container.    [Activation of TBU at +29 degC setting will be conducted on 9/12 (Sunday) and activity with KT &amp; BUP will start on 9/13 (Monday).  KASKAD investigates cultivation processes of micro-organism, animal &amp; human cells in microgravity.]
 
 FE-4 Doug Wheelock is on Day 5 of Session 2 of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment, continuing the current High Salt diet, with daily diet log entries.  Today’s activities, besides diet logging, involved taking blood samples for PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) analysis and preservation in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) as well as starting 24-hr urine collections.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Wheels &amp; Shannon are ingesting special diet (for Wheels: Session 1 – Low salt diet; Session 2 – High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level; for Shannon: first High salt, then Low salt).  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 &amp; 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged &amp; inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson set up and prepared the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware in COL, including MBS (Mixing Bag System), for her 6<sup>th</sup> and final session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, integrated with Thermolab.  After concluding, Tracy downloaded the data, including Thermolab, to a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop, powered down, cleaned up and temporarily moved all hardware aside for subsequent crew operation.      [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted his 2<sup>nd</sup> onboard session of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (“Study of<a name="_Toc416143806"></a><a name="_Toc416143862"></a><a name="_Toc416144063"></a> the Veins in the Lower Extremities”), using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex with orthogonal leads which Oleg Kotov had unloaded from Progress 36P on 2/26 and installed in the SM.      [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Fyodor set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump &amp; valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a “body box”) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).]
 
 With the NIKON/FSS photo gear and SONY VAIO laptop equipped with batteries charged yesterday, Fyodor conducted another 50-min run with the GFI-8 “Uragan” (hurricane) experiment from SM (Service Module) window 9, today focusing on the RGO and Fedchenko glaciers in the Pamir mountain range. 
 
 Later, Yurchikhin conducted shutter tests on the NIKON D2X #3 digital camera after adjusting its settings for the Rusalka protocol executed afterwards by CDR Skvortsov.    [The tests consisted of shooting exposures through the SM window at different shutter start and interval times.] 
 
 Alex then set up for the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) experiment at SM window #9 for another sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with the coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloading the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.  Photography began at ~6:12am EDT, lasting through 6:30am, with a picture taken every 10 sec.     [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.]
 
 Before bedtime, Fyodor initiated (later terminated) battery charging for the TVS video camcorder.
 
 In Node-3, Skvortsov &amp; Walker cleared access to the WRS (Water Recovery System) by temporarily removing the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) Kabin, enabling Shannon to perform the periodic routine replacement of the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly).   The old unit was stowed for return and the Tox-2 caps &amp; plugs of the spare were stowed for re-use.  FE-6 later closed out the R&amp;R (removal &amp; replacement), helped Alex to re-install the Kabin and then reconfigured the WHC to feed the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) for processing.     [RFTAs collect the substances cleaned from the pretreated urine by the UPA as it turns it into water.]
 
 After setting up the LFTP (Low Flow Transfer Pump), Shannon also offloaded condensate water from a CWC (Contingency Water Container, #1094) to the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly Waste Water Tank) for processing.     [The operation took an estimated 4h 45m.]
 
 Mikhail Kornienko shared in the WHC work share by performing the periodic changeout of the urine receptacle plus hose and its filter insert with new units.
 
 Working on the SDRM (SpaceDRUMS/Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix) experiment hardware, Caldwell-Dyson followed up on the recent troubleshooting of the fine position sensor issue by taking carousel gap measurements.     [After removing the outer &amp; inner PSS (Pellet Storage System) doors, Tracy measured the maximum gap size between the Carousel and its guide rails along the Carousel lid, and of the maximum gap size between the carousel base and the PSS enclosure.  SpaceDRUMS suspends a baseball-sized solid or liquid sample using 20 acoustic beam emitters during combustion or heat-based synthesis.  Materials can be produced in microgravity with an unparalleled quality of shape and composition.  SpaceDRUMS will support scientific understanding of processes like combustion synthesis and self-propagating high temperature synthesis and also provide direct commercial benefits from materials processing.  Advanced ceramics, polymer, and colloids can be processed in SpaceDRUMS.]
 
 Afterwards, Tracy removed NGTC desiccant packs from the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) interior.    [This allows ground-commanded cooling of the unit to -95 degC, started immediately, in preparation for the planned sample transfer from MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) to GLACIER.]
 
 Continuing the current round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, the CDR changed out the cartridges of the four dust filters (PF1-4) in the SM, discarding the used cartridges.
 
 In support of ground-commanded FIR (Fluid Integrated Rack) activities, which require a micro-G environment, Doug Wheelock configured the Lab camcorder and removed the FIR/ARIS alignment guides.  FE-4 also monitored ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) position control stability during the operations.  Later, the alignment guides were installed again.
 
 In the JAXA Kibo laboratory, FE-4 performed a functional checkout of the pull-out CB OC (Clean Bench Operation Chamber) with its joystick, prepared yesterday.     [Checkout of the CB’s microscope is scheduled for 9/15, and ground-command operations also still need to be verified.]
 
 Wheels also completed the weekly 10-min. CWC inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (24-0007J) lists 122 CWCs (2,836.2 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (25 CWCs with 1,042.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. /12.7 L in 17 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 44.0 L in 1 bag still requiring sample analysis, 128.3 L in 3 bags for flushing only with microbial filter, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only; 2. potable water (5 CWCs with 215.4 L, of which 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 1 bag with 42.5 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use;  3. iodinated water (84 CWCs with 1,550.1 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (6.3 L, in 1 bag with 6.3 L to be used only for OGA, plus 5 empty bags; and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (22.2 L, in 1 CWC with 20.2 L from hose/pump flush &amp; 1 bag with 2.00 L from EMU dump).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson conducted the periodic evacuation of the ARED advanced resistive exerciser’s cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.
 
 Yurchikhin did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance by updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Skvortsov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Alex, Mikhail &amp; Fyodor joined for a 30-min review &amp; discussion of a concentrated program of biotechnical experiments to be conducted throughout the month of September in the RS, focusing on a large number of biotech payloads due to arrive on Progress M-07M/39P on Sunday (9/12), including –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>BTKh-6    ARIL</li><li>BTKh-7    OChB</li><li>BTKh-8    BIOTREK</li><li>BTKh-10  KONYUGATSIYA</li><li>BTKh-14  BIOEMULSIYA</li><li>BTKh-26  KASKAD</li><li>BTKh-27  ASTROVAKTSINA</li><li>BTKh-40  BIF</li><li>BTKh-41  BACTERIOFAG </li><li>BIO-10     POLIGEN</li><li>TKhN-9   KRISTALLISATOR</li> </ul> 
 Sasha &amp; Misha had an hour each set aside for personal crew departure preparations, standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
 At 12:00pm EDT, Doug completed another VHF-1 emergency communications proficiency check over NASA’s VHF (Very High Frequency) stations, today with the VHF site at Wallops (12:00:45pm-12:07:34pm), talking with Houston/Capcom, MSFC/PAYCOM (Payload Operation &amp; Integration Center Communicator), Moscow/GLAVNI (TsUP Capcom), EUROCOM/Munich and JCOM/Tsukuba in the normal fashion via VHF radio from a handheld microphone and any of the USOS ATUs (Audio Terminal Units).     [Purpose of the test is to verify signal reception and link integrity, improve crew proficiency, and ensure minimum required link margin during emergency (no TDRS) and special events (such as a Soyuz relocation).]
 
 FE-4 filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 Wheels also assembled &amp; configured his Glenn harness with its transducer instrumentation for his exercise on the T2/COLBERT treadmill today, his 3<sup>rd</sup> SDTO (Station Development Test Objective) session with the instrumented harness.    [Recent data showed that several transducers were not providing usable data.  In order to maximize data acquisition, ground specialists have identified six viable transducers plus two spares for Shannon’s &amp; Doug’s use. These 8 transducers have been combined from both instrumentation kits and spares launched on Progress 38P.  Doug has 3 exercise sessions on T2 between each data collection session, and there will be 4 collection sessions using each Harness (Glenn for T2, followed by the TVIS harness for TVIS).]
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3/2x, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5). 
 
 At ~4:00am EDT, the entire crew held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with GOGU, i.e., the Russian Flight Control Team (Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
 At ~6:15am EDT, Yurchikhin supported a PAO TV downlink, transmitting a message of greetings to the participants of the World Congress of Spiritual Culture which begins on 10/18 at Astana, Kazakhstan, with the participation of Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbaev.    [Reportedly, representatives of 70 countries have submitted their application for participation.]
 
 At ~8:45am, Sasha, Misha &amp; Fyodor linked up with TsUP stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
 At ~11:14am, Shannon, Doug &amp; Tracy participated in a PAO TV interview of ~20 min with students at the Science Center of Pinellas County’s educational event at St. Petersburg, Florida, headed by Joe Cuenco.
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Muscat, Oman (ISS had a nadir view of the capital city of Oman.  Muscat is located on the coastline of the Gulf of Oman.  Contextual views of the urban area and surroundings were requested), Baghdad, Iraq (ISS had a near-nadir view of this famous Middle Eastern capital.  Overlapping context views of the urban and suburban area were requested), St. Paul Rocks islets, Brazil (Beagle Site.  Weather was predicted to be clear during this near-nadir viewing pass over these small islets, part of the St. Peter and St. Paul Archipelago.  Charles Darwin visited the islets in 1832.  Looking for a series of small grey islands and rocks; a small lighthouse may also be discernable.  Overlapping frames of the islets were requested), Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis (weather is predicted to be clear over the capital city of St. Kitts and Nevis.  The city is located on the southern coastline of the island of St. Kitts.  Context views of the city and islands were requested), and Havana, Cuba (looking to the left of track for the city of Havana.  The city is located on the northern coastline of Cuba.  Overlapping frames of the metropolitan area were requested to provide regional context for higher resolution imagery).
