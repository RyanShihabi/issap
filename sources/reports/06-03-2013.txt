35 Soyuz (35S) Crew Handover: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy continued handover with the 35S crewmembers FE-5 Parmitano and FE-6 Nyberg including on-orbit practices and lessons learned related to ISS systems and payloads. They also reviewed topics that are not limited to a particular module or scheduled activity as well as those that are usually scheduled as separate activities.   CDR Vinogradov reviewed use of ISS emergency hardware with FE-4 Yurchikhin, Parmitano and Nyberg.
Binary Colloidal Alloy Test (BCAT) Experiment: Cassidy initiated Sample 2 of this experiment today. BCAT documents the formation of crystals from microscopic spheres (known as colloids) suspended in a liquid, both on the surface of the sample container walls and in the bulk of the sample container. Results help scientists develop fundamental physics concepts previously unobserved due to the effects of gravity.
Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)-4 Preparation: FE-2 Misurkin and Parmitano successfully conducted a test of TV downlink via Ku-band and a Proximity Communications Equipment (PCE) test required prior to docking. ATV4 is scheduled to launch this Wednesday, June 5 and dock on June 15.
Joint Station LAN (JSL) Node 2 Utilization and Operations Panel (UOP)-1 Checkout: Nyberg checked out the power and data cable that provides Joint Station LAN (JSL) Ethernet connectivity between Node 2 and the Columbus Module Portable Workstations (PWS). This activity is one of the final steps in the Columbus Cycle 13/Obsolescence Driven Avionics Re-Design (ODAR) upgrades.
