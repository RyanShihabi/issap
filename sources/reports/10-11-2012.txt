ISS On-Orbit Status 10/11/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
Upon wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko terminated his 4<sup>th</sup> Sonocard experiment session, started last night for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
Next, Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops.
 
Akihiko Hoshide continued his current extended session of the ESA ENERGY experiment.       [Collection of a water sample from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) in the Lab and urine sampling (on 2<sup>nd</sup> void of the day) are continuing, as is adherence to the special ENERGY breakfast plus logging all ISS food &amp; drinks consumed during ENERGY experiment performance from lunch and dinner on Day 1 until breakfast on Day 10.  Aki wears an armband monitor, positioned on the right triceps where it started automatically on skin contact. The instrument must be worn for the entire 10-day ENERGY measurement period and removed only during showers or if needed during blood draws.  Activities without the armband monitor on the triceps must be carefully logged.   The monitor will be removed at the end of the 10-day period, then data will be downloaded from the device.   Background:  The observed loss of astronauts’ body mass during space flight is partly due to the systematic ongoing negative energy balance in micro-G, in addition to disuse. Unfortunately, the reason for such unbalanced match between intake and output is not clear, but appealing data suggest a relation between the degree of energy deficit and the exercise level prescribed as a countermeasure. In the ENERGY experiment, astronauts are invited to participate in a study that aimed to evaluate how much food is needed for astronauts during long-term space missions.  To do so, the science team will measure every component or variable of the astronaut's energy expenditure reflecting his energy needs.  Those variables will be measured twice: up to 4 months before flight and after at least 3 months in space but 3 weeks before landing.  The changes in the astronaut's energy balance and expenditure will be measured, which will help in deriving an equation for energy requirements in weightlessness.  This will contribute to planning adequate, but not excessive cargo supplies for food. Purpose of the ENERGY experiment is (1) to measure changes in energy balance during long term space flight, (2) to measure adaptations in the components of the Total Energy Expenditure TEE (consumption), and (3) to derive an equation for the energy requirements of astronauts.  TEE is the sum of resting metabolic rate (RMR, measured), diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT, measured oxygen-uptake minus RMR) and activity-related energy expenditure (AEE, calculated).] 
 
CDR Williams terminated the sampling run started yesterday with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor).      [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
In Node-3, Sunita afterwards completed routine maintenance on the WRS (Water Recovery System), first changing out the TOCA BC (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer Buffer Container, #1015) with a new one (#1012), then taking water samples for analysis in the TOCA, after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose with water from the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) and buffer solution from the BC.      [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.]
 
With STTS communications configured for work in MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2), Malenchenko conducted another session for the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), setting up the hardware and video camcorder, followed by the experiment run and subsequent downlinking of the video footage obtained with a SONY HVR-Z1J camcorder via RSPI (Data Transmission Radio Link).       [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS (Russian Segment): condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
CDR Williams &amp; FE-6 Hoshide had several hours on their timeline dedicated to unloading the SpX CRS-1 Dragon capsule and transferring cargo to ISS for stowage.  Later in the day, at ~2:15pm, Aki is scheduled for a phone debriefing with the ground on cargo transfer progress.      [After yesterday’s berthing, Dragon was configured to be powered by ISS. The crew then jumped ahead to today’s original timeline and removed all 4 CPAs (Controller Panel Assemblies) from the CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism). They then proceeded to open the Dragon hatch and install air ducting between ISS and Dragon, relieving today’s timeline.]
 
Hoshide powered up the CSL (Crew Support Laptop) and SSC (Station Support Computer) clients in the unused CQ (Crew Quarters) to allow MCC-Houston ground administrators to set up the PCs prior to the Soyuz 32S arrival (10/25).
 
Akihiko also looked for (and successfully located) two HRF PFM/PAM (Human Research Facility Pulmonary Function Module/Photoacoustic Analyzer Module) items (a bag filling assembly and a respiratory valve) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) required for future operations.
 
FE-4 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Malenchenko also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, working from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
With the video MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) running, Suni performed the periodic status check on the Dragon-based GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator), ensuring that the freezer is operational and its temperature is as expected, and then removed cold-storage samples from the GLACIER for transfer to an ISS-based MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) freezer, afterwards stopping MPC.
 
The CDR set up the video camcorder for historic documentation of her first NanoRack Module 9 activation, then retrieved NanoRack mixing tubes #1005 (6, 12, 14) and #1006 (2-5, 11, 13, 15) from temporary stowage.
 
FE-4 Malenchenko started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, today working several hours in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok).    [Using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush, Yuri cleaned the detachable fan screens 1, 2, 3 of the three SOTR gas-liquid heat exchangers (GZhT4), plus the fixed GZhT4 grill, interior closeout panel vent screens (panels 201, 301, 401), and also replaced the PS1 &amp; PS2 dust filter cartridges with new ones.]
 
Aki serviced the DECLIC (Device for the Study of Critical Liquids &amp; Crystallization) experiment in ER4 (EXPRESS Rack 4) by replacing the RHDD (Removable Hard Disk Drive) #003 in the DECLIC ELL (Electronics Locker) with a new one (#004).       [The French (CNES)/NASA-sponsored DECLIC is a multi-user facility to investigate low &amp; high temperature critical fluids behavior, chemical reactivity in supercritical water, directional solidification of transparent alloys, and more generally transparent media under micro-gravity environment.  DECLIC uses the standard infrastructure offered by the US ER4 (EXPRESS Rack 4) in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) module, with standard lockers.  Typical experiments for DECLIC include fluids (CO<sub>2</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>) close to their near ambient critical point engineered in a dedicated insert (ALI), directional solidification of transparent materials (succinonitrile alloy) engineered in a dedicated insert (DSI), high temperature, and high pressure critical fluids (H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, etc.) engineered in the dedicated HTI insert.  DECLIC is designed for remote science control, commonly called "Telescience".  Operation capabilities offer scientists the possibility to remotely visualize and modify their selected experiment conditions in the ISS from User Home Base through the CADMOS User Support &amp; Operation Centre.]
 
Sunita conducted the continuing preventive inspection &amp; cleaning of accessible AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) system bacteria filters in Node-1, Node-2 &amp; Node-3, with pre-cleaning photo documentation.
 
After yesterday’s Dragon berthing, Suni today tore down the RWS (Robotic Workstation) in the Lab, disconnecting the DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) bypass cable and turning off power to the Cupola UOP (Utility Outlet Panel).
 
Yuri Malenchenko performed the periodic switchover of the Russian STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to an alternate subset, today to the primary string after operating since 9/21 on the backup string.    [The "Voskhod-M" STTS enables telephone communications between the SM, FGB, DC1, MRM2 and USOS (U.S. Segment), and also with users on the ground over VHF channels selected by an operator at an SM comm panel, via STTS antennas on the SM’s outside.  There are six comm panels in the SM with pushbuttons for accessing any of three audio channels (LINE-1,-2,-3), plus an intercom channel (VPU).  Other modes of the STTS include telegraphy (teletype), EVA voice, emergency alarms, Packet/Email, and TORU docking support.]
 
At ~10:25am EDT, CDR Williams supported a PAO TV event, responding to two interview clients, - ABC News (Lisa Stark) and CNN “Newsroom” (Don Lemon). 
 
At ~11:05 am, FE-6 Hoshide had his regular weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [CDR &amp; FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed ARED/CEVIS (cont.).  Aki’s protocol for today showed ARED (cont.)]

CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were King George's Sound, WA-AUS (HMS BEAGLE Site:  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass in clear weather for this target with approach from the SW. In February 1836 Darwin landed here, but the stop seems to have been unimportant for his natural history studies. Darwin hosted a great dance for the local aboriginal people. At this time as ISS approached the coast, the crew was to aim towards nadir for this major bay, recognizable by its highly convoluted coastline), Foelsche Impact, NA-AUS (ISS had a fair weather pass in mid-afternoon light with this 6-km-diameter crater just right of track. It stands out as a lighter-toned, circular feature. Ages of the surrounding rocks show that the impact occurred more than 545 million years ago and CEO has no images of this crater in its database. Recommended was that the crew began a mapping strip at this time, looking just right of track, to acquire this difficult target), Kerguelen Island, Indian Ocean (there were probably scattered clouds over Kerguelen as it is seldom cloud-free. Only partial clearing was expected by the time of the ISS midday pass. This glaciated and volcanic archipelago is located in the far south Indian Ocean nearly 2,000 miles southeast of the island of Madagascar. Of greatest interest is imagery for monitoring of the rarely photographed ice field and glaciers located on the western end of the main island. Cook Glacier, and its ice field are the CEO prime features. With an area of ~403 km2, it is quoted as "France's largest glacier," since the islands are a French possession. At this time as ISS approached from the WSW, the crew was to look just right of track for detailed mapping views of this feature), SW. Glaciers-SPIF (on this pass ISS had partly cloudy conditions with the area of interest just right of track in mid-morning light. The crew may have found sufficient breaks in the cloud field for detailed views of these rarely-photographed glaciers near the southern end of this large ice field. As ISS approached the coast from the W at this time, the crew was to shoot these glaciers ending in long fjords), South Desolation Point, CHL (HMS BEAGLE SITE:  Darwin and the Beagle navigated the treacherous Strait of Magellan on June 10, 1834 and passed South Desolation Point into the open Pacific where the long swell of the open ocean constantly rages. Desolation Island is on the south side of the Strait and marks the western end of Tierra del Fuego. ISS had a mid-morning pass in partly cloudy weather. As it tracked eastward at this time, the crew was to look well right of track for shots of this challenging target), and Woollya Cove, Chile (HMS BEAGLE SITE:  This challenging target is located well right of track among small islands south of Tierra del Fuego. Charles Darwin visited here in 1834 as one of the first stops in his journey through this region. ISS had a mid-morning pass with partly cloudy conditions expected. At this time, as the crew tracked eastward over extreme southern Patagonia, they were to look obliquely right of track and try for overlapping frames of the islands and inlets of Tierra del Fuego).
