ISS On-Orbit Status 08/09/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Underway:  Week 10 of Increment 24.
 
 Upon wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR will inspect the filters again before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Also at wake-up, FE-6 Walker completed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol (skipped yesterday).     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 CDR Skvortsov completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated later tonight (~5:05pm EDT) before sleeptime, followed tomorrow by Bed #2 regeneration.     [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days. (Last time done: 7/20-7/20).]
 
 In preparation for the next spacewalk, EVA-16, on 8/11 (Wednesday), Tracy Caldwell-Dyson resized her EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) #3009 by adding ~1 in. to its torso length to lessen suit pressure on her shoulders while working outside.
 
 FE-4 Wheelock terminated METOX (Metal Oxide) canister regeneration in the A/L (Airlock) bakeout oven, and FE-6 Walker finished recharging the EMU batteries in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly.
 
 Then, Doug &amp; Tracy re-equipped their spacesuits with the METOX CO<sub>2</sub> absorber cans and freshly charged EMU batteries, while Shannon re-installed the charged HL batteries in the Helmet Lights and the PGT batteries in the powered Pistol Grip Tools.    [EMU #3005: METOX #5 &amp; Battery #2088; EMU #3009:  METOX #15 &amp; EMU Batt #2086.] 
 
 Afterwards, FE-2, FE-4 &amp; FE-6 joined in a 2-hr review &amp; discussion of preliminary details of the EVA-16 spacewalk on Wednesday, followed by an EVA teleconference with ground support personnel at ~9:15am.    [See below for a summary.]
 
 Starting a new round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, Fyodor Yurchikhin performed a one-hour inspection &amp; cleaning session of Group A ventilator fans and grilles in the SM (Service Module), while Alex Skvortsov a bit later conducted ventilation system maintenance in the FGB on the TsV1 fan, and then in the DC1 (Docking Compartment) and MRM2 Poisk modules where he cleaned the PF1 &amp; PF2 dust collectors in its air duct system and the protective mesh screens of the V1 &amp; V2 ventilator fans.
 
  After recharging the SONY HVR-Z1J camcorder battery for the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment, Fyodor assembled &amp; installed the payload hardware and later conducted the measurement session from SM window #9 at specific times (11:30am-12:00pm; 12:00pm-12:20pm), recording atmospheric radiation spectra.  Afterwards, the equipment was taken down and stowed.    [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment is designed for spectral observations of the Earth atmosphere and surface, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  Today’s thunderstorm measurements involved UV-range measurement of formations radiation during global electro-magnetic processes in the upper atmosphere.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
 Fyodor also completed the periodic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program in the Russian VKS auxiliary (non-network) laptops RSS1, RSK1, RSK2, RSE1, which are not loaded from the ground, from a special software program working with Norton AV on the FS (File Server) laptop, first scanning the latter, then transferring the database by flash-card to the other computers and scanning them one by one.     [Only the RSS2 laptop is automatically updated (once a week on Fridays from MCC-Houston).]
 
 Afterwards, FE-5 performed the periodic calibration &amp; adjustment test of the O<sub>2</sub> sensor of the SM SOGS (Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System) IK0501 gas analyzer (GA), using the BKGA/Gas Analyzer Calibration Assembly and IGZ/Analyzer Status Indicator (constituent meter).     [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2,</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
 Activities completed by Shannon Walker included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>The periodic maintenance &amp; visual inspection of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), checking out rails &amp; rollers, greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails &amp; rollers and evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration,</li><li>Preparing MELFI 1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) for reactivation by wiping down internal surfaces and leaving Dewar 2 trays out to dry, replacing them with trays from MELFI 3 (MELFI 1 Dewar 2 to be activated later),</li><li>Checking out the Lab RWS (Robotic Workstation) by switching DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) and RHC (Robotics Hand Controller) for control, and</li><li>Turning around (reconfiguring) the SONY D2Xs EVA cameras for EVA-16.</li></ul> 
 FE-3 Kornienko performed special 4-hr maintenance on the TVIS treadmill which included a swap-out of the old control panel with a new one, FOD (foreign object/debris) inspection, installation of closeout panel fasteners, and an unmanned speed run and audio capture, the latter recording the noise of the TVIS (with gyro deactivated) via a Shure microphone.
 
 Mikhail also set up and readied the PZE MO-9 equipment for another Russian “Urolux” biochemical urine testing, scheduled tomorrow for all three Russian crewmembers.    [MO-9 is conducted regularly every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for US crewmembers for IMG (Integrated Medical Group) PHS evaluation as part of the "PFE w/o Blood Labs" exam.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally for the Mir program.  The data are then entered in the Medical Equipment Computer (MEC)’s special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software.]
 
 Afterwards, Misha initiated overnight (10-hr) charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery for the new Piren-B Pyro-endoscope, part of the Russian BAR science instruments suite (other BAR components being the ТТМ-2 Anemometer-Thermometer, the charger cable, and the video display unit).      [Piren-B, a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, is part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Besides Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
 With its payload battery freshly charged, Kornienko set up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) experiment at SM window #9 for another sun-glint observation session, using the bracket-mounted spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with a coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloading the data to laptop RSE1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.     [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.]
 
 CDR Skvortsov’s timeline today included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>More relocating of stowage items from “unauthorized” FGB locations to alternate sites, performing a storage bag audit before equipment relocation and updating all relocations in the IMS (Inventory Management System),</li><li>Completing the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers], </li><li>Conducting the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), and</li><li>Working the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.    [Sasha’s report: “Everything OK.”]</li></ul> 
 At ~2:40pm EDT, Shannon Walker had her weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-4), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-3).   [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 ETCS Loop A Pump Module Update:     EVA-16, on 8/11 (Wednesday), is being extensively &amp; thoroughly replanned as a result of the disappointing outcome of EVA-15 which failed to get the nonfunctional ETCS (External Thermal Control System) Loop A PM (Pump Module) out and start work on the new pump.  Spacewalkers Wheelock &amp; Caldwell-Dyson ended up short of that, due to a balky and leaky QD (Quick Disconnect, M3) at the old PM (losing about 3 lbs of NH<sub>3</sub> in the process).  Re-attaching the QD and re-opening the valve stopped the leak.  For EVA-16, the plan is to lower Loop A NH<sub>3</sub> pressure (from 370 psi to ~200 psi), close two additional QDs (one each at each end of the S1 truss segment) to isolate/minimize the line segment to be vented, and then vent that coolant piping in the zenith direction (NH<sub>3</sub> to be lost from the pipe: ~ 15lbs, later from the PM: ~22 lbs, i.e., a total just under 40 lbs of ammonia).  M3 should then be “dry” (without pressure), allowing straight-forward valve closing and demating.  Next, 5 power/data cables will have to be removed, followed by four attachment bolts of the PM.  The latter will then be attached to the MBS POA (Mobile Base System Payload ORU Accommodation) via a grapple bar and vented, to be left on the POA for an extended period of time.  Replacing the PM and making all necessary connections will very likely require a third EVA (tentatively on 8/15, Sunday).  If at all necessary, a fourth EVA is also possible.
