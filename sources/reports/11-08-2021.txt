Endeavour Crew Undock/Landing: The Crew Dragon vehicle, Endeavour, carrying Thomas Pesquet, Shane Kimbrough, Megan McArthur, and Aki Hoshide undocked from the ISS today at 1:05 PM CT and will splash down later this evening. The completion of the 199-day Crew-2 mission marks the longest crewed capsule mission in US spaceflight history to-date and reduces the onboard ISS crew complement from seven to three.
Payloads:
EarthKAM (Sally Ride Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle Schools):  The EarthKAM software was shut down and the crew stowed the equipment.  EarthKAM allows thousands of students to photograph and examine Earth from a space crew’s perspective. Using the Internet, the students control a special digital camera mounted on-board the ISS. This enables them to photograph the Earth’s coastlines, mountain ranges and other geographic items of interest from the unique vantage point of space. The EarthKAM team then posts these photographs on the Internet for viewing by the public and participating classrooms around the world.
Systems: 
Crew-2 Dragon Departure Preparations: In preparation for the upcoming Crew-2 departure, the crew transferred emergency equipment and final cargo loads to the Crew Dragon vehicle. They also derouted the SSCs and then stowed the laptops in Node 2 for future use. After final preparations the crew donned their spacesuits and proceeded with hatch closure. The Dragon vehicle undocked today and is scheduled to splashdown off the coast of Pensacola, Florida this evening at approximately 9:33 PM CT.
