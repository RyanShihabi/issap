Microbiome: Kelly collected samples in support of the Microbiome experiment which were then inserted into Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) for later return.  The Microbiome experiment investigates the impact of space travel on both the human immune system and an individual’s microbiome (the collection of microbes that live in and on the human body at any given time). To monitor the status of the crewmembers’ microbiome and immune system and their interaction with the unique environment of the ISS, periodic samples from different parts of the body and the surrounding ISS environment are taken. As part of this study, the likelihood and consequences of alterations in the microbiome due to extreme environments, and the related human health risk, will be assessed.
SUPVIS-E Troubleshooting: Kelly conducted a conference with SUPVIS-E specialists, then with the ground assistance, successfully performed troubleshooting on the laptop in an attempt to regain connectivity and allow proper communication between the laptop and ground. ESA ground controllers will continue with commanding and checkout of the laptop.  SUPVIS-E aims at simulating selected future Human exploration scenarios including immersive remote control of a robot by an astronaut in orbit around a target object (such as Mars or the Moon). A crew member will control the ESA test rover located at ESOC (Germany) in near real time.
SpaceX (SpX)-7 Preparations: Kelly and Padalka completed another session of On Board Training (OBT) with the robotics trainer to prepare for capture/berthing of the Dragon vehicle. Today they practiced a 30 meter approach and two capture point hold runs. SpX-7 launch is planned for Sunday, June 28 with berthing on Tuesday, June 30.
