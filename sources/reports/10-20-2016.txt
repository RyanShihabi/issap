Group Combustion Troubleshooting: FE-5 resumed the troubleshooting on the Group Combustion Experiment Module (GCEM).  The crew removed the GCEM Combustion Chamber Element (CCE) from the Multi-Purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR) rack and installed it on the Work Bench to verify the air supply line Quick Disconnect (QD) connections.  FE-5 then reinstalled the Combustion Chamber and performed leak checks with the GCEM installed in the MSPR.  Ground teams are reviewing data and high-resolution images prior to proceeding with further troubleshooting steps.  The Group Combustion investigation tests a theory that fuel sprays change from partial to group combustion as flames spread across a cloud of droplets. In the Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack in the Kibo module, droplets of decane, a component of gasoline or kerosene, are arranged randomly on thin-fiber lattice points, and the flame and droplet positions and temperature distribution are measured as the flame spreads. Microgravity blocks convection, which on Earth would quickly disperse the droplets and combustion products before such measurements could be made. 
USOS Crew Off Duty:  FE-5 and FE-6 have a reduced work day in preparation for a busy weekend.  Soyuz Operations are continuing nominally to support a 48S docking to the MRM2 Zenith port on Friday 21-October at 9:59 GMT.  Cygnus operations remain on track for capture and berthing to the ISS on Sunday 23-October.  Cygnus is carrying more than 2300 kg of supplies, crew provisions, and science experiments to the ISS.  Cygnus Unberth is currently planned for 18-November.
