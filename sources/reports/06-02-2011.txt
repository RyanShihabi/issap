ISS On-Orbit Status 06/02/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
At wake-up, Garan conducted another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, his 18<sup>th</sup>.      [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
CDR Borisenko completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated later today (~5:15pm), followed tomorrow by Bed #2 regeneration.     [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days. (Last time done: 5/9-5/10.]
 
After FE-1 Samokutyayev terminated the charging of the Piren battery started last night and verified functionality of the Piren-B Piroendoscope, he &amp; Andrey Borisenko then spent ~2.5 hrs with the Russian KPT-12 payload with its BAR science instruments suite, using the Piren-B instrument to check out micro conditions of SM (Service Module) panel cladding material (PFO/material oblitsovki panelej) to assess the necessity of panel replacement.  Areas of attention, showing material discoloration or contamination, are on panels 334, 335, 338, 234 &amp; 235.  Problem area monitoring is necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data were downlinked via OCA, and the activities were supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Later in the day, Andrey initiated recharging the Piren battery.       [Objective of the Russian KPT-12/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-B is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
After yesterday’s preparations, FE-1 Samokutyayev completed Part 1 (of two) of the periodic window inspection &amp; photography in the SM, using a tool kit with ruler, adhesive tape, 90-deg equilateral triangle &amp; measuring tape, the NIKON D2 X digital camera with 28-70 mm lens, a flash attachment, and sketches of the windows under scrutiny with previous detected flaws marked and flaw tables.     [Specific focus was on windows 1, 6, 7, 8, 12, 26 in the SM, VL1 &amp; VL2 (EV hatch 1,2) in the MRM2 Poisk module, and VL2 in the DC1 Docking Compartment.  Observed defects were recorded in image and text files on the RSK1 laptop for subsequent downlink via U.S. OCA assets.  Objective of the inspection, which uses a digital still camera (Nikon D1X w/SB-28DX flash) and voice recorder, is to assess the window pane surfaces for any changes (new cavities, scratches, new or expanded old stains or discolorations affecting transparency properties) since the last inspection.  The new assessment will be compared to earlier observations.  Defects are measured with the parallax method which uses eyeball-sighting with a ruler and a right isosceles triangle to determine the defects' size and position with respect to the window's internal surface (parallax being the apparent change in an object's position resulting from changing the observer's position).]
 
Activities performed by FE-3 Ron Garan included –

Borisenko checked out proper communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, and then downloaded data accumulated from the GFI-7 Molniya-GAMMA experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28 .       [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.]
 
Later, the CDR conducted the daily monitoring of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM which is taking structural dynamics data during the ATV2 reboost of the ISS.  The data were later copied from the BUSD Control &amp; Data Gathering Unit to a USB-D-M-3 stick for downlink to the ground.  The BUSD archive was then deleted and the DAKON-M restarted.      [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
Borisenko also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Before sleeptime, Andrey will initiate recharging the DZZ-12 RUSALKA batteries.     [RUSALKA (“mermaid”) is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.]
 
Ron Garan had another ~1h 50m set aside for more post-ULF6 cleanup activities, consisting largely of collecting items in the USOS (U.S. Orbital Segment) modules and returning them to their stowage locations, based on an uplinked Cleanup Restow Locations list.
 
At ~10:15am, the three crewmembers undertook the standard 90-min. Depress OBT session with procedures designed to respond to a rapid depressurization emergency.  A joint drill debrief with ground specialists via S-band at ~12:30pm wrapped up the exercise.      [Objective of the exercise is to provide proficiency training for crew response during depressurization.  The training exercise is performed under the most realistic emergency conditions possible.  Instructors &amp; OBT experts at the control centers (TsUP-Moscow, MCC-Houston, COL-CC/Oberpfaffenhofen and SSIPC/Tsukuba) stood by to send commands as required and respond to crew questions.  The crew moved throughout the station in order to simulate emergency response actions per procedures at specific checkpoints; they communicated &amp; coordinated simulated actions with the control centers as if this were a real event.]
 
At ~11:30am, FE-3 Garan held the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists, discussing post-ULF6 cleanup questions.
 
At ~4:40pm, Ron is scheduled for his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
Before “Presleep” period, Ron will power on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).
 
SPDM Relocation:   The SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) completed a ground-commanded walk‑off to MBS PDGF-3 (Mobile Base System / Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture 3) and grappled the SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator).  Dextre relocation to MBS PDGF-2 will be completed tomorrow and the SSRMS will be configured for ULF-7 support. 
 
Elektron Update:    Elektron oxygen generator troubleshooting continues.  The problem is believed to be gas bubbles – they will be removed next week.  No need to activate Elektron now because of good supply of O<sub>2</sub> from ULF6 and available supply from ATV2.  The plan is to reactivate Elektron on 6/20.
 
SSC Transition:    The long-prepared software transition of onboard SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops to Version 4 is being initiated.  It will complete the SSC transition to the T61p platform (with a few short-term exceptions) and provide major new capabilities.  Server OS (Operating Systems) were transitioned from Windows to Linux.  Ron Garan is scheduled on 6/6 for 5h 5m to support the upgrade, followed by post-reload steps on 6/7.  Configuration files of the Russian BRI Smart Switch Router (SSR) and of the JSL (Joint Station LAN) have already been configured to support the transition/reload, BRI yesterday by Andrey, JSL on 5/4 by Paolo.
 
ARED Display Failure:    The ARED Display unit has experienced a hard failure and will be replaced with an onboard spare.  Until then, the crew is recording their exercises manually on spreadsheets.
 
TVIS Treadmill Failure:    TVIS is still No Go for use with a suspected mechanical issue inside the gyroscope assembly.  Estimated 21.5 hours of Russian crew time are needed for TVIS inspection &amp; troubleshooting.  Replacement of the gyro is being considered for after ULF7.
 
ISS Reboost:   Later today, at 6:30pm EDT, a one-burn ISS reboost with ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters will be conducted for a duration of 16 min 51 sec and a delta-V of 2.5 m/s (8.20 ft/s).  Altitude gain is expected to be ~4.3 km (2.3 nmi).  Purpose of the reboost is to set up phasing for the Progress 43P launch &amp; docking on 6/22 &amp; 6/24.  
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Kampala, Uganda (the Ugandan capital city of nearly 1.7 million is located in the south central part of the country near the north shore of Lake Victoria.  ISS had a late morning pass today with partly cloudy weather expected as it approached from the NW.  At this time, as it nears Lake Victoria, the crew was to look nadir for this target and try for views of the entire city within a single frame), Florida Coastal Everglades (this is an LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) Site located in the Everglades of south Florida.  Ongoing research is focused on understanding the ecosystems along the major drainage basins of the region known as “sloughs” where fresh water from the interior moves slowly to the sea.  On today’s fair-weather, mid-morning pass you will approach the target area from the northwest near nadir.  Trying to create a high-detail mapping strip that begins at the south shore of Lake Okeechobee in the north and progresses southward to the coast of Florida Bay in the south), and Ubinas Volcano, Peru (ISS had a near-nadir pass over Peru's most active volcano at midday with clear skies expected.  The summit caldera contains an ash cone, and debris avalanche deposits extending 10 km from the southeast flank of the volcano.  As ISS approached from the NW over the Andes Mountains, the crew was to look carefully for this isolated peak.  CEO staff is seeking detailed, overlapping frames of the volcano summit and flanks).
