Space Headaches:  Peake completed his Weekly Space Headaches questionnaire. Headaches can be a common complaint during spaceflight. The Space Headaches experiment will provide information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement in the well-being and performance of crew members in space.
 
Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) Alignment Guide Removal: Peake installed three of four Alignment Guides on CIR to lock down the PaRIS hardware. Installing four guides causes an over-constrained condition and has the potential to damage to the Snubbers or other ARIS/PaRIS hardware. CIR provides sustained, systematic microgravity combustion research and it houses hardware capable of performing combustion experiments to further research of combustion in microgravity.
 
Common Communications For Visiting Vehicles (C2V2): Kopra completed this week’s C2V2 activities when he successfully installed two communications units. Health and status checks are currently scheduled for no earlier than March 28. A complete system checkout will occur at a later date, including a Radio Frequency (RF) system functionality check.
 
Robotic Onboard Trainer (RoBOT) On Board Training (OBT) Cygnus: In preparation for OA-6 arrival currently scheduled for March 26, Kopra and Peake completed an offset grapple session. Robotics and Visiting Vehicle teams were available for questions and/or feedback regarding procedures and operations.
 
Crew Provisions Relocate: Peake moved some crew provisions from Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA)1 to Node 1 to clear space in the PMM for OA-6 cargo. He also photographed the contents of 2 pantries to verify bag fullness and usage rates for those items. This data will assist in manifesting decisions for future visiting vehicle.
