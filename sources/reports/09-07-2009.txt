ISS On-Orbit Status 09/07/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Flight Day 11 of STS-128/17A.  Labor Day --- Crew Farewell.  Underway: Week 15 of Increment 20
 
  Today’s sleep/wake cycle for the crew: Sleep – 3:00am; wake – 11:30pm; sleep tomorrow – 2:30am.
 
  For Padalka, Romanenko &amp; Barratt, the “day” began with another periodic session with the Russian biomedical routine assessments PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.     [MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures.]
 
  FE-4 Robert Thirsk started out with the extended “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment for which Bob ingested an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  FE-2 Tim Kopra &amp; FE-2-20 Nicole Stott completed another “liquid” part of the biomed experiment INTEGRATED IMMUNE, collecting their liquid saliva samples right after wake-up.     [Along with NUTRITION (Nutritional Status Assessment), INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmember soak a piece of cotton inside their mouth and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned on the Shuttle so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
  For the INTEGRATED IMMUNE assessment, Mike Barratt &amp; Nicole Stott are also on schedule for their blood collection, with Bob Thirsk assisting as Operator.    [They will be using the Shuttle Integrated Immune Blood Collection Kit (#1019) located in the middeck.  The Saliva Return Pouches and Blood Sleeves are stored at ambient temperature on the Shuttle for return.]
 
  With all MPLM (Multipurpose Logistics Module) transfers completed, FE-5 Frank De Winne &amp; MS4 Christer Fuglesang prepared “Leonardo” for unberthing by 
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Removing      the PFE (Portable Fire Extinguisher) and PBA (Portable Breathing      Apparatus) and stowing them  in the Node-1 &amp; Node-2 PEPS (Portable      Emergency Provision Systems) lockers, respectively [also, a total of eight      LHAs (Lamp Housing Assemblies) had been removed before from the MPLM for      use in the ISS],</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Egressing      the MPLM (~1:35pm EDT),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Deactivating      the module (~2:15pm),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Demating      all MPLM jumpers &amp; ducting plus re-installing thermal covers      (~2:15pm), and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Depressurizing      the MPLM/Node-2 vestibule, followed by leak checking for 30 min (with      ground participation, ~3:45pm).</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Later,      at ~6:45pm, Nicole Stott &amp; Christer Fuglesang will work with the      ground at demating the Node-2 nadir port CDM (Common Berthing Mechanism)      by removing CBM bolts and deploying latches. </li> </ul> 
  In the SM (Service Module), CDR Padalka collected KAV condensate water samples from the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Recovery System upstream of the FGS gas/liquid mixture filter/separator (FGS) and then performed regular maintenance work on the SRV-K2M, removing &amp; replacing its life-expired FGS with a new one.  The old unit was discarded and the IMS (Inventory Management System) updated.
 
  Afterwards, Gennady will complete the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated tomorrow at ~2:05am before crew sleep, followed tomorrow by Bed #2 regeneration.  (Last time done: 8/20-8/21).     [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.]
 
  The CDR is also scheduled to update the AntiVirus program in the Russian auxiliary (VKS) laptops RSS2, RSK1, RSE1, RSE2 from a new uplinked program copy on the RSS1 laptop, first scanning the latter, then transferring the database by flash-card to the other computers and scanning them one by one.
 
  FE-3 Roman Romanenko has the following activities on his work timeline –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo2">Performing preventive      maintenance on the Russian ventilation system, today first replacing the      PS1 &amp; PS2 filter cartridges in the FGB, then working in the SM to cleaning      the “Group B3” fan screensVV1RO &amp; VV2RO, plus replacing      the PF1-PF4 filter cartridges),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo2">Checking behind SM panels      (#102, #209) to assess the feasibility of removing and replacing a      pressure sensor (ZDD2) of the Russian Thermal Control System’s Loop      1 (KOB-1) on the PKR3 accumulator panel (to see whether there is enough      room to use a pipe wrench),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo2">Using the CMS      (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check      for Vinyl Chloride, Ethanol, and Ethylene Oxide in the SM  [CMS      uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as      O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen      Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan,      Sulphur dioxide, Hydrogen cyanide, Phosgene, etc.],</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo2">Conducting periodic maintenance on the      deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control      &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter      assembly (BF) with a new unit from FGB stowage (done last: 6/17), then      reactivating the unit (the old filter will be discarded),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo2">Performing the periodic checkout &amp;      performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS      hatchways,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo2">Completing daily IMS (Inventory Management      System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta      file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated      export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow,      Baikonur), and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l4 level1 lfo2">Performing the routine daily servicing of      the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in      the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among      else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp;      KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U      urine containers.]</li> </ul> 
  After Mike Barratt set up the JAXA CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) fan vacuum cleaner assembly in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Bob Thirsk –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Attached the assembled stirring      fans on the CBEF Micro-G IU (Incubator Unit) temperature controller      surface,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Relocated and connected      the power supply cable to the stirring fans, then later</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Connected cables for the      Space Seed payload between the ELT (Experiment Laptop Terminal) and UOP      (Utility Outlet Panel), and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Attached the Dehumidifier      to the CBEF.</li> </ul> 
  Barratt saved the log files of the JPM PCS (Portable Computer System) to the MDM (Multiplexer/DeMultiplexer computer).
 
  CDR Padalka has 90 min reserved on his timeline for transferring excessed equipment and waste to the Progress 34P and pack in the cargo ship-turned-trash can for disposal.
 
  Afterwards, Gennady was to conduct a 2:45h test on the KURS-P Antenna #1 (AKR-VKA) feeder circuits in the SM, doing circuit checks with the FSH3 spectrum analyzer. 
 
  The FE-1 started (later terminated) another 5-hr automatic sampling run (the 28<sup>th</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer), also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-4 (Station Support Computer 4) laptop.    [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  Today’s data will again to be compared with VOA and GSC (Grab Sample Container) measurements.  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
  FD11 Midday Break (“lunch”) is timelined tonight at 6:45pm-7:45pm.
 
  After the midday meal, Mike Barratt will tear down the oxygen transfer equipment used to provide pre-breathing O<sub>2</sub> from the Shuttle to the ISS Airlock for the spacewalks.
 
  Tim Kopra &amp; Nicole Stott have several more hours for handover activities on their schedule, including restowing the EVA tools used during the three 17A spacewalks.
 
  Later, Thirsk &amp; Stott are scheduled to review DCB (Double Cold Bag) packing procedures, then transfer payload samples and Icepacs in a DCB to the Shuttle Middeck for return to Earth.
 
  FE-5 De Winne will perform the (currently frequent) offloading of the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) from WRS (Water Recovery System) Rack 1 into a CWC-I (Collapsible Water Container-Iodine) with the common H<sub>2</sub>O transfer hose (which took about 23 min) from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary Port, then flush the system.
 
  At ~2:09pm, Jose Hernandez &amp; Nicole Stott joined in a TV PAO interview exchange with TV stations Telemundo, WTSP-TV in Tampa-St. Petersburg, FL, and Univision.
 
  The ISS crew are performing their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-4, FE-5, FE-2-20), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).
 
  Afterwards, Bob Thirsk transfers the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  At ~6:15pm, PLT Ford and MS2 Hernandez are to grapple the MPLM with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System), followed by unberthing and transfer of “Leonardo” to the Shuttle PLB (Payload Bay).  Berthing in the PLB and MPLM ungrappling is expected at ~9:00pm. 
 
  About 1.5hr later, at ~10:30pm, we will have the traditional Crew Farewell ceremony, followed by air duct removal and hatch closure at ~10:45pm-115pm, handled on the ISS side by Barratt &amp; Stott, on the Orbiter side by CDR Sturckow &amp; MS1 Forrester.  This completes the crew rotation of Timothy Kopra and Nicole Stott.  The standard one-hour leak check on the ODS (Orbiter Docking System) will follow.
 
  Sleeptime for the ISS crew will begin tomorrow morning at 2:30am, to last until 11:00pm, for the Discovery crew at 3:00am, until 12:00pm tomorrow.  Undocking is then scheduled for 3:27pm.
 
 Conjunction Alert:   NASA FCT (Flight Control Team) is alerted to two conjunctions of the ISS with Object 30535 (Chinese Fengyun 1C debris).  The first TCA (Time of Closest Approach) of concern is on 9/9 (Wednesday) at 4:37am EDT, or approximately 13 hrs after undocking.  The second TCA is at 9/9 at 6:08am.  The ISS FCT is working options for performing a possible stand-alone posigrade DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) after Shuttle undocking.  The debris avoidance timeline currently being considered assumes ISS would maneuver to avoid the earlier TCA (4:37am).  This maneuver would utilize the Progress 34P R&amp;D translational thrusters.  A mated DAM, with Shuttle, is not being considered at this time.
