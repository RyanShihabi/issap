ISS On-Orbit Status 06/09/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Soyuz 27S Docking Day.
 
The ISS crew has entered a sleep cycle shift to accommodate tonight’s Soyuz docking, with a short workday this morning (Period 1) and a long work period later tonight (Period 2):
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Wake: 2:00am – 9:00am
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Sleep: 9:00am – 1:00pm
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Wake: 1:00pm – 3:00am (6/10)
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Sleep: 3:00am (6/10) – 2:00am (6/11).
(returning to Normal on 6/12).
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev terminated his 3<sup>rd</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
At wake-up, FE-3 Garan conducted another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, his 22<sup>nd</sup>.      [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Ron Garan also concluded his first 24-hr urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol, having stored all samples in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  The equipment was then returned to stowage.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood &amp; urine procedures for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
Later, FE-3 performed the periodic service of the FCF (Fluids Combustion Facility) in the FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack) by changing out the Bio sample on the Bio Base.    [After configuring the US Lab camcorder to cover activities for POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center/Huntsville), Ron opened the lower &amp; upper FCF doors, rotated the LMM SBA (Light Microscopy Module / Spindle Bracket Assembly) from Operate position to Service position, removed the used sample from the Bio Base, returned it to the Bio kit and installed a new sample from Slot 6 in the kit onto the Base.  He then rotated the LMM SBA back to Operate position and closed the rack doors then turned on two switches and notified POIC that FIR was prepared for ground-commanding the RPC (Remote Power Controller).]
 
CDR Borisenko completed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways to ensure the ventilation/circulation system will cope with the upcoming doubling of the station crew.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
Later, Andrey activated the GA/gas analyzer (KM0305M1) in the Soyuz TMA-21/26S (#231), docked at MRM2 “Poisk”, to prepare for checking up on the 27S GA (see anomaly report, below).
 
In the SM (Service Module), the CDR started the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment for another test run.  Later, Andrey tagged up with ground specialists for debriefing and dismantled the equipment.      [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrophotometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from windows #9 &amp; #6, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
Activities completed by Alex Samokutyayev during Work Period 1 included –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">The regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">The routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM;  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">The daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">The periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit; [the AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO<sub>2</sub> during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP)], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Installing an air duct from the SM IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) fans into the ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2), to be left in place until ATV2 undocking.</li></ul> 
Garan relocated the IWIS RSU (Internal Wireless Instrumentation System / Remote Sensor Unit) in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory, Stbd Endcone) to Node-1 (Stbd/Deck) to act as a signal-relay between the RSU already in Node-1 and the one in the FGB.     [Ron then plugged the EDR (European Drawer Rack) laptop cable into the power supply vacated by the RSU.]
 
Afterwards, FE-3 reconfigured the AQM (Air Quality Monitor) data cable to work with a T61p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop by modifying it with a USB-to-Serial cable segment.     [In its previous form, the AQM cable was not compatible with the T61p.]
 
Later, Ron performed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.       [The new card (28-0014A) lists 103 CWCs (2,341 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (21 CWCs with 846.4 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 562.2 L in 14 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (70 CWCs with 1,278.3 L (also 35 expired or leaking bags with 641.5 L);  4. condensate water (180.7 L in 8 bags, plus 2 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (35.6 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health],
 
Preparatory to tonight’s arrival of Soyuz 27S, Garan closed the external protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).
 
Ron also terminated the regeneration of METOX (Metal Oxide) canisters #0007 &amp; #0011, started yesterday In the A/L (Airlock).    [Recyclable METOX canisters replaced the old one-way/expendable LiOH (lithium hydroxide) canisters as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) removal system in the EMU/spacesuits in 2001.  During use, CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed by them and later removed through a special valve opening by “baking” (heating), which takes place in a special oven in the A/L.]
 
At ~4:05am EDT, Andrey, Sasha &amp; Ron held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
At ~1:35pm, Ron Garan conducted his regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
After the crew’s 4-hr midday sleep (9:00am-1:00pm), the ISS crew made final preparations for the Soyuz arrival:
 
For covering the docking, Aleksandr &amp; Ron activated the Ku-band video “scheme” for converting the RS video signal from the SONY HDV camera to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band from the SM, for downlinking “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.  After the docking, Garan will remove the equipment.     [Since the wireless SSC-21 (Station Support Computer 21) was not available today, Ron activated the VWS (Video Streaming Workstation) laptop in Node-1 for both the conversion and the “streaming” MPEG2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoding.  Sasha meanwhile set up and checked out the RSS1 (SSC-1) laptop at the TsP (Central post) for monitoring the imagery during the MPEG-2 channel transmission.]
 
CDR Borisenko activated &amp; verified proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the Soyuz docking.  Later, Andrey will download the stored measurements.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR).
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev will configure STTS station communications for the docking.
 
Stating at ~3:35pm, CDR Borisenko will monitor the final rendezvous &amp; approach phase of the Soyuz 27S (#702) spacecraft until its docking at the MRM1 port on DO1 at ~5:22pm.  (Caveat &amp; Timeline see below).
 
After the Soyuz docking at MRM1, Sasha’s activities will include –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Switching hatch KVDs (Pressure Equalization Valves/PEVs) between MRM1 &amp; Soyuz back to Electric control mode,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Dismantling, with Ron, the Ku-band transmission “scheme”,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Turning off the BRTK TVS video system for subsequent downlinking of footage, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Reconfiguring STTS station comm for the nominal post-docking hardline mode (MBS).</li></ul> 
Andrey meanwhile will copy the structural dynamics data of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment from the BUSD Control &amp; Data Gathering Unit to a USB-D-M-3 stick for downlink to the ground.  The BUSD archive will then be deleted and the DAKON-M restarted.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
RS thrusters on the ISS will be inhibited from 7:15pm-9:20pm EDT for the leak check and clamp installation.
 
The ISS crew will then (~6:15pm-6:45pm) take time out for a 30-min snack.
 
Soyuz CDR Sergei Volkov meanwhile will be conducting the leak checking on the Soyuz side (by evacuating the Orbital Module and watching pressure readings).
 
Hatch opening and Crew Welcome are expected to take place at about 8:30pm-9:00pm, to be transmitted to the ground live on PAO TV.  Borisenko will then install the interface-rigidizing SSVP BZV quick-disconnect clamps at ~9:00pm-9:20pm. 
 
Afterwards, the newcomers, FE-4 Sergei Volkov, FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa &amp; FE-6 Mike Fossum join CDR Andrey Borisenko, FE-1 Aleksandr Samokutyayev &amp; FE-3 Ron Garan for the obligatory Safety Briefing by Andrey (~9:25pm-10:10pm), to familiarize them with procedures and escape routes in case of an emergency. 
 
The new crewmembers will then switch to the ISS work plan, continue drying their Sokol suits  &amp; suit gloves and transfer critical science payloads from the Soyuz to the ISS.
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
 
Soyuz TMA-02M/27S Anomalies:    RSC-Energia this morning reported two anomalies on 27S:
During today’s rendezvous burn on Soyuz Orbit 17 a lower than expected thrust (~60%) was seen in DPO-B thruster #14 (nominal thrust: 13.3 kgf).  A subsequent test on Orbit 20 confirmed this, and specialists suspect FOD (foreign object/debris), perhaps some shaving, in the prop metering line.  Thruster #14 acts along x-axis and is also used for yaw control (y-axis).  There is no other thruster like this one, but 2 smaller DPO-M thrusters (nominal: 2.7 kgf each) can perform this function independently of #14.  Because even at 60% capacity this thruster still provides more thrust than the 2 smaller ones together, specialists recommend using the degraded engine after uplinking a software patch to extend the range of its allowable burning time (nominal: 400 sec).  The software patch will also account for the case of the thruster becoming completely blocked, in which case the system will switch over to the 2 smaller thrusters.  If #14 should clear, the time range in the s/w patch will allow a return to the nominal configuration.  The docking plan will be modified to account for the decreased thrust.  RSC-Energia expressed confidence that the docking can still be kept on time, at 5:22pm.
 
The second anomaly were lower than expected CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) readings of the Soyuz GA (Gas Analyzer) during the first two orbits.  On Orbit 3, the data became nominal.  Specialists believe that Sokol spacesuit checks prior to liftoff flooded the sensor with O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen), suppressing CO<sub>2</sub> (the GA in this Soyuz has no screen to protect against this case).  Plans are to leave the GA activated for 3 days after docking to allow specialists to monitor data.    Borisenko has turned on the 26S GA and will use it with the ISSA GA to compare the readings for accuracy.
