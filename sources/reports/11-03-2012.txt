ISS On-Orbit Status 11/03/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – Crew off duty.
 
After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops.
 
Working as a team, the six crewmembers conducted the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including all USOS (US Orbit Segment) modules like Lab, Nodes, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, Oleg Novitskiy, Yuri Malenchenko &amp; Evgeny Tarelkin also completed regular weekly maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP), the grilles of the SKV air conditioner in the SM and the Russian VKS (Auxiliary Computer System) laptops.
 
In the US Lab, FE-3 Ford used the vacuum cleaner on the vents of the T61p OpsLAN Servers LS1 &amp; ISS-SERVER1 in bay O1, to ensure optimal performance.
 
Kevin also performed the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 &amp; O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.     [Crew report: “Screens a little dirty, but not bad.  All cleaned up and running nominally.”]
 
In the MRM2 Poisk module, Yuri continued the current twice-daily (morning/evening) checking of vacuum/pressure conditions in the Plasma Chamber of the Russian KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall-3 plus) Telescience payload for upcoming operations.       [The PK-3+ equipment comprises the EB (Eksperimental’nyj Blok) Experiment Module with a turbopump for evacuation, Ts laptop, video monitor, vacuum hoses, electrical circuitry, four hard storage disks for video, and one USB stick with the control application.]
 
Akihiko Hoshide prepared the equipment for taking measurements for the JAXA BLR48 (Biological Rhythms 48/BIORHYTHMS) experiment and then started the session with a wrist-worn Actiwatch Spectrum (#9001) with BLR48 software and the medical laptop. Sunita Williams will begin her BLR48 measurements next Saturday (11/10).      [First, Aki uses Holter 1 for data recording, then swaps it with Holter 2, Multi Media memory card and fresh AAA battery after 24 hrs (and 10 min after power-up) for another 24 hrs. Objective of this study for Aki &amp; Suni is to examine the circadian variation of astronaut’s digital electrocardiograph during space flights using the cardiac autonomic function of the “Digital Walk Holter ECG” with its electrodes attached to the chest and the wrist-worn Actiwatch Spectrum activity monitor to supplement circadian rhythms data. For Aki only, the objective is also the long-term ODK2 (Onboard Diagnostic Kit 2) evaluation of a remote healthcare system’s operability and accuracy with the collected data, in order to develop a computerized remote healthcare system for astronauts.]
 
Oleg serviced the BTKh-14 BIOEMULSIYA payload, transferring the Rekomb-K bioreactor from the TBU incubator (+37 degC) in the DC1 (panel 403) back to the TBU-V incubator (+4 degC) in MRM1 (panel 102), with Evgeny shooting documentary photo/video.
 
Evgeny later also moved the BTKh-6, 7 ARIL/OChB biotech science payloads from the KRIOGEM-03 thermostat-controlled container (+29 degC) to the +4 degC TBU-V.    [“Aryl” is an abbreviation commonly used to represent any group of organic molecules which form an aromatic ring. OChB refers to research into bioactive germ cultures producing the yeast SOD (superoxide dismutase).]
 
FE-1 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
On TsUP Go, Yuri Malenchenko was to perform a total pressure repress of the ISS cabin atmosphere with air from Progress M-17M/49P SRPK tankage.
 
Aki Hoshide, Suni Williams &amp; Kevin Ford filled out their standard FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop Terminal).  It was the 14<sup>th</sup> time for CDR &amp; FE-6, the first time for FE-3.      [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.] 
 
Kevin broke out and set up the equipment for his first Nutrition/Repository/Pro K generic urine collections which start tomorrow morning for their 24-hour run. Samples will be secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).
 
At ~7:20am, Oleg, Evgeny &amp; Yuri powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and conducted a ham radio session with Kursk University students at the city of Kursk.     [Some intelligent questions posed to the crew:  What holidays do you observe during your mission? Does other crewmembers’ citizenship affect that? What traditions are connected to that, what national features, something maybe introduced by cosmonauts?  Do young people want to work in space industry: in GCTC (Star City), MCC, space industry companies? In your opinion how to attract them there?  After the mission do you cognize differently social life on Earth, problems of the state and nature, etc. Do you change your opinion about it?  Do you often communicate with youth festivals participants?  What characteristics are the most important for young people in your view?  Do cosmonauts and astronauts from different countries continue fellowship after joint missions?  Do different expeditions’ crews have events for their joint meetings?   After the first mission is over, does the next mission seem scarier or more fascinating?  Do you think of yourselves more as scientists now that you engage in scientific experiments – or workers, performers? Space is often a workplace of international crews. Do you think it is of practical or token value? Do you believe that joint space operations promote cooperation of different nations?  Were the skills you mastered when preparing for the mission of any use to you when you returned to Earth? Can certain elements of your training program be recommended for ordinary school and college students? What elements of mission training would you include into the school curriculum?]
 
At ~9:15am, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
CDR, FE-2 &amp; FE-4 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Evgeny at ~8:30am, Yuri at ~11:15am, Suni at ~4:05pm EDT.
 
At ~1:10pm, the three Russian Flight Engineers supported a PAO TV event with Moscow, downlinking 
congratulations to two anniversaries.    [(1) the Regional Public Foundation of Heroes of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation named after General E.N. Kocheshkova on its 15<sup>th</sup> Anniversary since its establishment, celebrating on 11/17 in the Red Hall of the Cultural Center of the Armed Forces, and (2) the 70<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the formation of the special forces in the Far East for monitoring and supporting manned and unmanned spacecraft.]
 
The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).     [CDR &amp; FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today shows ARED/T2 (continuous), with T2 (interval, 2 min.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 4 min/Kinem.), ARED/T2 (cont.), and T2 (int., 30s) for the next 5 days. Aki’s protocol for today shows T2 (int. 2 min), with ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), and T2 (int., 4 min.) on the following 4 days.]
 
Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo5">More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo5">Shooting a video for the Roskosmos TV studio in its joint production with Channel Russia 24 for the weekly program “Space”,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo5">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and</li></ul><ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo7">A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens and PI emission platform using the SKPF-U (Photo Image Coordinate Reference System) to record target sites on the Earth surface.</li></ul> 
WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (32-0005G) lists 14 CWCs (178.3 L total), including 1 empty bag, for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (3 CWCs with 98.1 L);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L);  3. Iodinated water (5 CWCs with 54.55 L); 4. Waste water (1 CWC with 9.68 L bag EMU waste water), and 5. Special Fluid (OGS) (1 CWC with 2.5 L). Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
