Ocular Health Tonometry Test:  Virts took his blood pressure, then Cristoforetti, acting as the Crew Medical Officer (CMO), performed a tonometry test of Virts as part of a regular series of tests for Ocular Health.  Additional eye examinations of Virts will be performed over the next two days.  The Ocular Health protocol is a systematic gathering of physiological data to characterize the risk of microgravity-induced visual impairment / intracranial pressure changes in ISS crewmembers.  Researchers believe the measurement of visual, vascular and central nervous system changes over the course of this experiment and during the subsequent post flight recovery will assist in the development of countermeasures, clinical monitoring strategies, and clinical practice guidelines.
Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) Cable Replacement:  The crew has been operating with one of two ARED cables disengaged.  Today, Wilmore removed the disengaged left Upper Stop Cable, straightened and repaired a previously used spare upper stop cable and installed the newly repaired cable.  With this installation the crew will be able to resume ARED operations at higher loads.
Controller Panel Assembly (CPA) “Dog Ear” Modification:  In the future, Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA)-3 will be relocated from the Node 3 Port location to Node 2 Zenith.  Due to interference with the Center Disk Cover attachment bracket at Node 3 Port, any CPA installed at this location requires a metal tab “dog ear” to be cut off in order to ensure proper clearance.  Today, Cristoforetti and Virts completed this CPA modification for use during the upcoming PMA-3 relocation.
