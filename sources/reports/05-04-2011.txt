ISS On-Orbit Status 05/04/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
 
Upon wake-up, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator.      [Maxim Suraev installed these filters on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Alexandr inspects the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-6 Coleman, FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-3 Garan conducted the 5<sup>th</sup> onboard JAXA HAIR experiment (Cady &amp; Paolo’s 2<sup>nd</sup>, Ron’s first), collecting hair samples of each other, then inserting them into MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), Dewar 1/Tray A at -95 degC and closing out the activity.
 
Using the KPT-2 BAR TTM-2 anemometer/thermometer, Samokutyayev took measurements of air flow velocities in the RS (Russian Segment).     [Data were obtained at the VPO11 fan for the BSPN Payload Server, Vozdukh vacuum pump, IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) outlets, across the FGB/Node IMV air duct and at the V1, V2 AGZh low-noise fan air duct outlet in the MRM1 Rassvet.] 
 
Afterwards, Sasha had ~2 hrs set aside for the periodic (~annual) extensive audit/inventory of the SUBA SD1-7 &amp; SSD305 lighting fixtures in the RS including portables, for the purpose of assessing lighting in the RS, planning delivery of replacements, and updating the IMS (Inventory Management System) on the ground.     [Going by an uplinked listing of 54 lights fixtures in SM (Service Module, 26), FGB (12), DC1 (5), MRM1 (7), MRM2 (3) &amp; 42P (1), Sasha checked functionality of the lights, replaced failed units where necessary and also inventoried the supply of spares in 6 bags.  The resulting data files were downlinked to TsUP-Moscow via OCA.]
 
Borisenko verified proper communications between the BSPN Payload Server (Matching Unit) and the RSS1 laptop and then downlinked data accumulated on the BSPN from the GFI-7 Molniya-GAMMA experiment (mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28) via RSS1 and OCA, starting at 6:25am and ending at 12:30pm EDT.      [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.]
 
Andrey also worked on the Russian RSE1 non-network laptop, re-installing its Vers. 1.4 software to allow restoration of the Symantec antivirus application, then reloading the experiment data files which were removed beforehand for safe-keeping.
 
With the Lab camcorder set up to provide ground awareness during his subsequent OBT (Onboard Training) activity, FE-3 Garan undertook a 2-hr ROBoT (Robotics On-Board Trainer) session with the MSS (Mobile Servicing System), followed by a ground debrief tagup via telephone and final cleanup.      [The OBT focused on the ULF6 Handoff of the OBSS (Orbiter Boom Sensor System) by the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) to the SRMS (Shuttle RMS).  The required maneuvers are very similar to the ULF7 OBSS handoff for which Ron has trained.  The procedure takes the SSRMS from OBSS pre-grapple to OBSS unberthing and handing it off to the SRMS.  From here, the SSRMS will be maneuvered to grapple the SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) on the Lab PDGF (Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture).] 
 
Later, Ron used the Velocicalc instrument to take IMV flow measurements in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), specifically at the IMV inlets overhead aft &amp; starboard aft, and at the starboard forward outlet.
 
Paolo Nespoli configured two T61p laptops as the new JSL OCA (Joint Station LAN Orbital Communications Adapter) Routers (one primary, one spare), connecting the Ethernet cable, then loading the router software via LIS (Load Image Server) on the HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) of the OCA laptops.      [The LIS was configured beforehand by the ground from the Airlock SSC10 (Station Support Computer 10).] 
 
FE-5 also built 2 new alkaline battery packs by replacing drained 9V Lithium battery cells, to be used for the CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units.
 
Afterwards, Paolo unstowed the Pro K pH kit and prepositioned it with controlled diet menu items and daily consumables in preparation for his upcoming FD180 (Flight Day 180) Pro K Controlled Diet activity.      [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
Activities performed by FE-6 Cady Coleman included –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Deploying four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground  [two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Conducting the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Starting her 3<sup>rd</sup> session (of 3 total) with the JAXA experiment “Biological Rhythms” (BIORHYTHMS), for which she donned the electrodes of a new DWH (Digital Walk Holter) for ECG (electrocardiogram) recording, then initiated the data take for the next 24 hrs,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Initiating another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer) and deactivating the system ~5 hrs later    [this was the 33<sup>rd</sup> session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Taking the periodic air samples with GSC (Grab Sample Container) units, in the center of the SM (#2040), Lab (#2065) and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory, #2063),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Removing &amp; replacing the MMA (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus) power cable of the Kobairo Rack in the JAXA JPM, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Gathering remaining tools &amp; equipment required for tomorrow’s bracket installation in Node-2  [after Flight 17A the Node-2 rack bays were reconfigured to stay out of the sway space required for T2/treadmill operations at Node-2 D5.  With T2 now relocated to Node-3, the Node-2 rack bays will be placed back on K-BARS (Knee-Brace Assembly Replacements) and Pivot Fittings to support quicker and easier rack rotations, and the Node-2 ELPS2 (Emergency Lighting Power Supply 2) will be removed.]</li></ul> 
FE-2 Borisenko performed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways to see how the ventilation/circulation system is coping with the 6-person crew.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
Later, Andrey had 2.5 hrs set aside for cargo unloading &amp; transfer operations from Progress M-10M/42P, logging moves in the IMS.
 
Sasha Samokutyayev serviced the biotech BTKh-26 KASKAD (Cascade) payload, taking the bioreactor from the TBU-V (Universal Bioengineering Thermostat V) thermostatic container (+29degC) in the MRM1 module, mixing it in the KT container in the DC1 and placed it back in the TBU-V which he then switched to +4 degC temperature.       [KASKAD investigates cell cultivation of microorganisms, animals and human in microgravity to obtain concentrated biomass (emulsion) with a high content of cells, providing the increased output of target BAS (bioactive substances).  The BIOEMULSIYA science hardware includes a closed-type autonomous bioreactor in a bag, the KT thermostat (temperature-controlled)-body with BUP-06 actuator control unit in DC1 and the onboard KRIOGEM-03 cooler in the SM (Service Module).]
 
CDR Kondratyev performed periodic surface sampling, today taking samples in the FGB at 12 different equipment &amp; structure locations for microbiological tests.      [Equipment could be moved for the sampling, and any spots of mold or dirt on the goods, equipment and structural elements were to be photographed.] 
 
Dmitri also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Borisenko took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Paolo Nespoli &amp; Ron Garan again spent several hours on ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) cargo operations.      [Today’s activities mainly consisted of finishing unpacking items from rack bay S1, started yesterday, and trashing packing material.  More cargo ops are scheduled on Friday.] 
 
At ~2:40pm EDT, Ron conducted a tagup with MCC-Houston to debrief on today’s ATV cargo transfers.
 
With the CDR’s stay on the ISS approaching its end with Soyuz 25S return on 5/23, Dmitri spent ~30 min with Sasha &amp; Andrey on handover activities.
 
Kondratyev &amp; Samokutyayev, also as handover, performed the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit.    [The AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO<sub>2</sub> during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP).]
 
At ~7:30am, the three Russian crewmembers joined up for another downlink for the Russian experimental OBR-5 (Obrazovanie-5, Education 5) project VELIKOE NACHALO (“Great Beginning”), addressing uplinked questions and comments from the Russian public on matters concerning human space flight.       [Goal of this experiment is to develop a method to promote the accomplishments of national piloted cosmonautics using digital IT (information technology), for which RSC Energia has created a “Planet Korolev” website (<a href="http://gagarin.energia.ru/">http://gagarin.energia.ru/</a> ).  The public inputs were/are the results of a questionnaire on this website.]
 
Cady &amp; Paolo had time set aside for personal crew departure preparations; these are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
Later tonight before “Presleep” period, Cady will power on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2).
 
ISS Reboost:   Tomorrow morning at 7:20am EDT, a one-burn ISS reboost with ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters will be conducted for a duration of 4 min 3 sec and a delta-V of 0.6 m/s (1.97 ft/s).  Altitude gain is expected to be ~1.04 km (0.56 nmi).  Purpose of the reboost is to set up phasing for 25S landing on 5/23.
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania (ISS had a late morning pass over Africa’s highest mountain located in northern Tanzania near the border with Kenya.  Approach was from the SW, and while the surrounding area may have been partly cloudy, the summit area should have been cloud-free.  Of particular interest are the rapidly shrinking snowpack and glacier features of this renowned peak.  At this time the crew was to aim nadir for detailed views of these features using the long lens settings), St. Paul Rocks islets, Brazil (HMS Beagle Site:  Darwin and the Beagle briefly visited this isolated, equatorial Atlantic site in early February of 1832.  This tiny group of islets and rocks is also known as the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago.  The islands are of particular interest to geologists as they expose rocks associated with the Earth's mantle above sea level.  At this time, looking nadir for the islands as ISS approached the area from the SW.  With late morning light and a few clouds the crew should have been able to photograph all of them in a detailed mapping pass), and Havana, Cuba (the Cuban capital of 2.1 million is located on the north coast of the narrow, western part of the island.  ISS had a midday pass in fair weather for this target.  As it approached western Cuba from the SW, the crew was to aim nadir for this urban area.  Instead of the detailed view, this time they were to try for a context view of the city).
