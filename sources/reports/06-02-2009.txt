ISS On-Orbit Status 06/02/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
  FE-4 &amp; FE-5 continued their first session of sleep logging for the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a 7-day-long session.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, Bob &amp; Frank wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, and they use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  CDR Padalka, FE-1 Barratt, FE-2 Wakata, FE-3 Romanenko, FE-4 Thirsk &amp; FE-5 DeWinne began their workday before breakfast with the periodic session of the Russian biomedical routine assessments PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement and PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement, using the IM mass measurement device which Padalka then stowed away again.  Third time for Gennady, Mike &amp; Koichi, first time for the newcomers.    [Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures.  For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IM "scales" measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed.]
 
  Barratt &amp; Wakata conducted more preparations for the STS-127/2JA spacewalks, viz. –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Koichi began setting up      the US Airlock (A/L) for EVA operations, including re-routing an SCU (Service      &amp; Cooling Umbilical) to allow EV2 to work the EVA hatch and EV1 to      work the UIA (Umbilical Interface Assembly) panel and the depress valve,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Mike initiated charging of      NIKON D2Xs EVA camera batteries,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Configured two EVA cameras      for spacewalk (not using D2Xs #1107), and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Took ~10 min of      “sight-seeing” video of the A/L interior for 2J/A crew      familiarization.</li> </ul> 
  Working in the DC1 Docking Compartment, Padalka &amp; Barratt continued preparations for tomorrow’s suited dry-run and the EVA-22 spacewalk on 6/5 (Friday) by –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Reviewing EVA procedures,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Configuring the STTS      communications systems in the DC1 for their presence, </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Installing the usual      additional BNP portable air repress bottle in the DC1 (to support a DC1      repress in the event of a failure of the DC1/PkhO hatch’s pressure      equalization valve)  [the regular BNP bottle is already installed      in the repress line of the SM’s work compartment (RO).] </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Installing US EMU      (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) components on the Orlan-MK suits, such as      helmet lights,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Installing Orlan attached      hardware (OTA) plus taking photos of the outfitted Orlans for downlink      (OTA equipment includes: right-hand swing arm with tool caddy, small trash      bag, wire ties, tethers, D2Xs camera, ratchet wrench and wing knob),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Preparing auxiliary NASA      equipment to be used in Orlan plus taking photos of the outfitted Orlans      for downlink,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Mounting the Fresnel lens      viewing aid in the helmets,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Filling the DIDBs      (disposable in-suit drink bags) and installed them in the suits, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Unstowing EVA emergency      first-aid medical packs and stowing them in the DC1.</li> </ul> 
  To configure the Progress M-02M/33P cargo ship, docked at the “Pirs” DC1 nadir port, for ground-commanded emergency undocking if it should become necessary during the use of the DC1 airlock for the EVA-22, Romanenko &amp; Padalka –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Activated the Progress      (i.e., SUBA/Onboard Equipment Control System &amp; SOTR/Thermal Control      System),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Removed the air heater/fan      unit &amp; air duct in the passageway,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Released the quick-release      screw clamps which rigidize the docking joint (with RS/Russian Segment      thrusters inhibited during the closing-up activities),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Took documentary video of      the DC1/Progress interface prior to hatch closure and downlinked the video      via Ku-band for ground inspection,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Closed the hatches, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Performed the usual      one-hour leak check on the vestibule between the DC1-SU &amp; SU-33P      hatches to test for hermeticity.</li> </ul> 
  FE-5 DeWinne supported a ground-controlled checkout of the PROX (Proximity Communication System) from SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center)/Tsukuba by turning off the power switch of the PROX rack in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), which he had activated on 5/31.     [This involved getting behind a HCP (Hardware Command Panel) cable guard cloth flap and turning off two switches.  PROX will be required for the HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle) arrival before it will be berthed with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System).]
 
  Also in the JPM, FE-4 Thirsk supported the current periodic humidity check on the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) in the Saibo Rack, by closing the facility’s door which Wakata had opened yesterday.
 
  Koichi meanwhile supported a micro-G assessment by tapping a portside seat track in the JPM several times with his fist to provide intentional excitation to the MMA (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus) and SAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System).    [With the crew size doubled, TCQ (Temporary Crew Quarters) for Bob Thirsk were installed in the JPM at loc. JPM1F3, using CWC-I (Collapsible Water Container-Iodine) bags as radiation protection.  Since JAXA has plans to conduct micro-G sensitive science (such as the Marangoni Experiment) during crew sleep later in this Increment, micro-G data gathering is being conducted, using MMA &amp; SAMS simultaneously, to assess the impact on these experiments of crew motions.] 
 
  Also In the Kibo laboratory, Wakata worked on the SLT (System Laptop Terminal), updating it with new procedure display files and checking out the files.
 
  In order to return the failed VDS VTR-1 (Video Distribution System/Video Tape Recorder) of the Lab RWS (Robotic Workstation) on Flight 2J/A, Mike Barratt accessed its location in the LAB1P5 rack, behind the RWS and removed the unit.    [In order to avoid having to repeat the recent communications checkout of the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System), a launch commit criterion for 2J/A, the VTR removal had to be accomplished without demating any RWS cables.  This procedure had been “innovated” first by the Exp-13 crew, and Barratt today also managed to complete it successfully and stow the VTR in a Ziploc bag for return.]
  
  For testing the new software uploaded on 5/25 to the RSE2 A31p laptop for the RS Zveno-B (“Link-B”) modems, Romanenko supported the ground in a comm session which involved file transfer via Zveno.     [The software supports comm between the RSE2 and the Zveno in TsUP-Moscow in active state when booting &amp; operating the laptop.  Zveno is controlled from the ground without crew intervention except for nominal ops the crew must turn on RSE2 prior to the comm session and later turn the laptop off again on TsUP-Moscow Go.    The link runs over the SM REGUL comm system, enabling data to be uplinked/downlinked and commands to be uplinked directly.  Regul provides for two-way voice communication, digital command/program information as well as telemetry transmission via RGS (Russian Groundsites).  It also has the capability to receive and transmit range, radial velocity, and time-referenced information.  It is the nominal uplink path for all Russian commands and is the only subsystem that operates using the Command Radio Link (KRL).  Operating at a low data rate, it is equivalent to the U.S. S-band system.  There is no Russian equivalent of the U.S. high data rate Ku-band system, based on the TDRS satellites.]
 
  Roman also completed the periodic transfer of US condensate water from CWCs (#1073, #1021) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO.     [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.]
 
  Frank performed the periodic WRS (Water Recovery System) sample analysis in the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.  After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to SSC-7 (Station Support Computer 7) via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged for calldown.   [The current procedure is a work-around for TOCA’s failed catalyst.]
 
  The FE-5 also supported the ground in the test fill and subsequent R&amp;R of the failed RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) #003 that was recovered last week (5/28) with the successful removal of the QD (Quick Disconnect) Key.  After the test fill, the RFTA was to be removed &amp; replaced with RFTA #002 for a nominal configuration.    [The ground performed a UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) processing cycle to drain the WSTA (Waste Water Storage Assembly) tank to below 2% so that Frank could demate the hose connecting the WHC to the UPA.  At this point, the WHC became unavailable for the crew, until further word from the ground later today.]
 
  In the SM, Gennady Padalka wrapped up the installation of KURS-P cabling for supporting the docking of the Russian MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2), to be launched on a Proton later this year.
 
  Romanenko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Working off the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, the FE-3 was also to conduct the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  The three newcomers had another PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, their fourth, Frank at ~7:10am, Bob at ~11:10am, Roman at ~12:00pm EDT.
 
  Bob Thirsk checked out the US SLM (Sound Level Meter) instrument and then used it to conduct the periodic noise level measurements program in the station interior for a 2-hr acoustic survey, including transfer of the recorded data to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [A total of 44 acoustic measurements were obtained, specifically at 13 locations in the Lab, 12 locations in the SM, two in the JPM, eight locations in Node-2 and 9 locations in the FGB.  The SLM gives instantaneous noise levels and their frequency spectra, which are transferred to the MEC laptop via an RS232 cable and later downlinked with regular CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) data dump or via OCA.]
 
  Mike performed the periodic status check on the payloads CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) and ENose (Electronic Nose), both located in the ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2).
 
  Gennady completed the periodic data collection on the long-term BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment, copying data from its built-in control computer to a PCMCIA memory card for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.    [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-15 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]
 
  FE-4 &amp; FE-5 received their orientation briefing on physical exercise procedures and use of the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation).
 
  Barratt set up the video equipment with G1 camcorder in Node-1 with the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) in the field of view, for the subsequent recording of Bob &amp; Frank’s first ARED exercise.    [This meets the engineers’ video requirements, to record ARED exercise within 14 days of a new crewmember using the device.  This was a live downlink.]
 
  With the three newcomers performing their first onboard physical exercise, the entire crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), ARED (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5) and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-3/2.5h).     [On the CEVIS, the actual loads remain slightly lower than the commanded loads, but this was expected.  A manual correction of the pertinent calibration coefficient via the control panel touch screen will be done at a later time when the new value has been determined.] 
 
  Later, Romanenko transferred the exercise data file to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  The three newcomers had another PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, their fifth, Roman at ~1:45pm, Bob at ~2:10pm, Frank at ~2:30pm EDT.
 
  Wakata had an hour set aside for regular crew departure preparations, working on the standard end-of-increment cleanup preparatory to his return to Earth around 6/29.    [It is usual for crewmembers to be granted reduced workdays for making their departure preparations, as their return date approaches.]
 
  Roman, Bob &amp; Frank each had an hour to themselves for general orientation (station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting station residence, if they choose to take it.
 
  FE-1 &amp; FE-4 spent another 60 min each on gathering, prepacking &amp; staging cargo itemized in an uplinked list for return on Endeavour (2J/A) in June.
 
  At ~10:45am EDT, Bob Thirsk downlinked two PAO TV messages of ~10 min each to CSA/Canada.    [The first message was for Canada Day, to be replayed on 7/1 during the official celebrations in Ottawa as part of the noon show attended by the Prime Minister and the Governor General (this event is open to the public – always a large gathering – and will air on national television; CSA will also post this message on their web site), the second was a “Get Fit for Space” message in collaboration of CSA with an event called the “Get Fit for Space Challenge,” to promote the importance of physical health in daily life (the message will be posted on the CSA and “ParticipAction” web sites, and CSA will distribute it to TV networks as a public service announcement).]
  
  At ~3:35pm, the entire crew is scheduled for a teleconference with ground specialists to discuss yesterday’s two-hour emergency egress equipment readiness drill.
 
  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Volga - Ural Delta, Russia (the Volga is the longest river in Europe.  It drains much of Western Russia and empties into the Caspian Sea.  Since 1978 Caspian Sea level has risen over 2 meters, submerging valuable wetland habitats.  Shallow coastlines like the Volga delta are especially sensitive to sea level rise.  The crew was to take broad context views of the delta which should have appeared to the left of track.  These kinds of images will be used to document coastal changes), Falmouth, England (Beagle Site.  The port of Falmouth is located on the southernmost spur of the island of Great Britain.  ISS had a nadir overpass for collection of overlapping frames of the city), Portsmouth, Devon, England (Beagle Site.  Portsmouth is located further east along the southern coastline of Great Britain from the previous target of Falmouth.  The city is located to the NE of the nearby island of Portsea.  Nadir viewing, overlapping frames taken along track were requested), London, England (this was one of those rare opportunities where the weather over this great city should have been clear enough for detailed imagery.  London is the largest metropolitan area in the European Union and as such is one of CEO’s designated "megacities".  Using the long lens to document land use boundaries within the city.  Overlapping images were requested.  The city should have been very close to nadir), and Barringer Impact Crater, AZ (Barringer, or Meteor Crater, has been dated at approximately 50,000 to 60,000 years old.  It was the study of this crater by Gene Shoemaker that set the standard for the identification and confirmation of impact craters around the world.  Nadir view of the crater was requested).
 
  CEO photography can be studied at this “Gateway” website:
 <a href="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/" title="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/">http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov</a>  (as of 9/1/08, this database contained 770,668 views of the Earth from space, with 324,812 from the ISS alone).
