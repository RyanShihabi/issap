ISS On-Orbit Status 11/02/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
  
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Today 10 years ago Bill Shepherd, Yuri Gidzenko &amp; Sergei Krikalev, as Expedition 1, entered the ISS from Soyuz TM-31, initiating a decade of continuous occupancy of the outpost by humans.  More than 196 people have since visited the complex, and by the exact time of the anniversary (5:21 a.m. this morning), the station has completed 57,361 “inhabitated” orbits of the Earth, having travelled some 1.5 billion miles.  Representatives of the five international agencies that built and operate the station have agreed in principle to continuing its use for another decade.  More than 600 different research and technology development experiments have been conducted on the station, many of which are producing advances in medicine, recycling systems and a fundamental understanding of the universe.  Happy Birthday, ISS! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
  
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">L-1 Countdown for      STS-133/ ULF5, Discovery’s last flight, continues nominally toward      liftoff tomorrow at 3:52pm EDT.</li> </ul>  
  At wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Fyodor again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
  
  CDR Wheelock, FE-6 Walker &amp; FE-3 Kelly continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 7<sup>th</sup> for Wheels &amp; Shannon, 2<sup>nd</sup> for Scott, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
  
  Also after wake-up, Wheelock, Walker &amp; Kelly performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift (therefore, for the next sleep shift sequence RST is scheduled twice daily from 11/1 through 5 days after the STS-133 crew lands).  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
  
  FE-2 Skripochka conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~4:05pm EDT before sleep time.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday by Fyodor.     [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days. (Last time done: 10/11-10/12).]
 
  FE-1 Kaleri transferred the new Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal) from Progress 40P to the ISS, set it up and initiated operation, taking documentary photography.    [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS: condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
  Yurchikhin set up pumping equipment with the electric compressor (#41) in the SM (Service Module) and transferred remaining water from the Rodnik BV1 tank of Progress M-07M/39P to an EDV container for condensate water (KAV).  39P is docked at the SM aft port.
 
  Immediately thereafter, Fyodor replaced the usual A-R water transfer hose with a T2-PrU air line, and started the standard bladder compression &amp; leak check of the 39P’s BV1 water storage tank to get it ready for urine transfer.  Flush water was to be transferred to an EDV or caught in a towel.      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
  FE-6 Walker performed the periodic evacuation of the ARED exerciser’s cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.
 
  Afterwards, Walker conducted an IMS (Inventory Management System)-guided audit/inventory of the contents of medical locker D2 in the Lab (loc. D4), except for the IMAKs (ISS Medical Accessory Kits, #1014, #1025, #4012, #4007) which were not audited but consolidated.
 
  In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Shannon serviced the ESA DOSIS (Dose Distribution Inside ISS) payload, swapping DOSTEL (Dosimetry Telescope)-1 and DOSTEL-2 for troubleshooting, monitored by the ground via the VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1).
 
  For use by the Shuttle crew during the docked phase with Discovery/ULF5, Shannon unstowed two BPMSUs (Battery Powered Speaker Microphone Units), equipped them with fresh batteries and configured their dual drag-through cable strings and QDs (quick disconnects), along with video adapter cables.  One BPMSU was located at the Node-3 Cupola RWS (Robotics Workstation), the other near the Node-1 nadir hatch for PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) ops.      [The long dual strings, one going through Node-3 to the Lab, the other further on to Node-1 and its connecting modules, will be plugged in at a drag-through QD assembly at the PMA-2, with one half assigned to the station, the other to the Shuttle.]
 
  FE-3 Kelly had about 3.5h set aside for another research session with the CFE ICF2 (Capillary Flow Experiment/Interior Corner Flow 2) experiment, first setting up and testing the hardware, including HD (high definition) camcorder, in the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) in the US Lab, then running the fluid operations and later tearing the equipment down and putting it back in stowage with MWA and camcorder.      [CFE has applications to the management of liquid fuels, cryogens, water-based solutions and thermal fluids in spacecraft systems.  ICF is one of three CFE experiments, the others being Vane Gap (VG) and Contact Line (CL).  Each of the CFE experiments is represented with two unique experimental units (1,2), all of which use similar fluid-injection hardware, have simple and similarly sized test chambers, and rely solely on video for highly quantitative data.  Silicone oil is the fluid used for all the tests, with different viscosities depending on the unit.  Differences between units are primarily fluid properties, wetting conditions, and test cell cross section.]
 
  Afterwards, Scott worked in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), servicing the JAXA MI IPA (Marangoni Inside / Image Processing Unit)  by removing &amp; replacing 5 hard disks of the VRU (Video Recording Unit).     [The replaced VRU disks were put in a Ziploc bag for return to SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center/Tsukuba).]
 
  Skripochka &amp; Yurchikhin had another ~3h set aside for gathering &amp; preparing tools &amp; equipment for the Russian EVA-26, to be conducted by Fyodor (EV1) &amp; Oleg (EV2) on 11/15, starting at ~9:30am EST and lasting an estimated 5h55m, with Doug Wheelock supporting the airlock ops.      [Objectives are: Installing space experiment “Test” on SM &amp; DC1, installing the URM-D portable multipurpose work station on the SM RO l.d. (large diameter), taking photos of the IPI-SM monoblock unit (accelerator channel) of the IMPULSE space experiment on RO l.d., wiping the KONTUR (“ROBOTIK”) monoblock with dry towels, then deactivating &amp; removing KONTUR from URM-D, and finally installing a gap spanner on DC1, fasteners &amp; SKK #1-M2 cassette on MRM2 “Poisk”, and struts between MRM2 &amp; SM, MRM2 &amp; FGB.]
 
  In ESA’s COL, CDR Wheelock supported ground-executed combined system run-in temperature testing on the BLB (Biolab) rack by inserting 6 medium cartridges in BLB TCU-2 (Thermal Control Unit 2) at +8 degC, then installing the insert and lower insulation in the BLB ATCS-2 (Automatic Temperature Controlled Stowage 2).
 
  With the assistance of Doug Wheelock for cue card printing, hardware setup, readying food items and providing video coverage, Shannon Walker supported the new ESA TIS (Taste in Space) experiment in the SM as test subject, her 2<sup>nd</sup> time.     [EPO TIS is an educational activity that compares the results of a blind tasting of 6 different food items on the ground and in space.  TIS is conducted by a single blindfolded test subject in the RS (Russian Segment), with the help of another crewmember.  During the experiment performance, the test subject is required to answer questions as per experiment script which is recorded using a Lavaliere microphone hooked up to the G1 camcorder.  This activity is not downlinked in real time; cuts can be made in the recording all along the sequences as the final product will be edited.]
 
  The CDR retrieved the WRS (Water Recovery System) high-flow water transfer pump and replaced a damaged roller and roller bolt (partially bent &amp; galled) with new ones from JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment) stowage.
 
  Other activities performed by Wheelock were –

The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained      concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory,      spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are      Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to      Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT      subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed      rest studies.]</li> </ul> 
  Oleg Skripochka unpacked &amp; deployed new Progress 40P- arrived RODF (Russian Operations Data Files) material, updating the books on Technical Experiments (TE), Biological Experiments (BTKh) Geophysics (GF), Science Experiments, Deactivation/Activation Procedures, DC1 EVA Procedures &amp; Cue Cards, Communications Systems (RTO), Atmosphere Revitalization System (SOGS), EVA-26, and 40P Cargo Transfer Ops.  
 
  Shannon conducted the periodic EHS TOCA (Environmental Health System Total Organic Carbon Analyzer analysis of potable water directly from the WRS WPA (Water Recovery System Water Processor Assembly).
 
  Alex Kaleri unpacked &amp; prepared a new cable and diagnostic CD (Compact Disk) delivered on Progress 40P, then used it on a detailed troubleshooting investigation of the failed SPS Analog/Digital Converter of the Soyuz 24S Descent Module’s “Neptune” console (PKSA).    [Preliminary results from the Russian specialists indicate the problem is hardware related, which is preventing the SPS from receiving power.]
 
  FE-6 Walker had ~1h for more cargo prepacking for ULF5.
 
  Yurchikhin completed the daily IMS maintenance by updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  FE-5 also did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Before sleeptime, Fyodor will set up the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 10<sup>th</sup> Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
  FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE-5 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Fyodor at ~8:25am, Alex at ~1:20pm, Oleg at ~1:30pm EDT.
 
  At ~9:30am EDT, the entire crew teamed up for a PAO TV event in observance of the 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the arrival of Expedition 1 on the station and the start of permanent human occupancy of the complex.  NASA Administrator Bolden offered congratulatory comments to the crew and a short exchange with them, followed by the question &amp; answer portion of the event from the media at NASA centers and the international locations in Moscow and Tokyo.
 
  At ~1:55pm, Skripochka &amp; Yurchikhin shot more video footage of the ISS interior and life onboard, for the Roskosmos TV Channel (“Telekanala Roskosmosa”)
 
  Also at ~1:55pm, Shannon powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 2:00pm conducted a ham radio session with students at S.K. Bukit Damansara, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
 
 ARED Rope Repair:    According to crew report, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device was not retracting its exercise rope fully because of the bulge associated with the splice of the exercise rope was “catching” on the pulley system.  Because the fray and splice were getting caught in between the two pulleys and not allowing the exercise rope to fully retract, it caused the detents to become disengaged during bar exercises.  The crew attempted to remove the bulge in the ARED exercise rope.  Due to an unexpected amount of Nomex threading, the crew was unable to improve the splice. The rope repair was aborted and Scott Kelly installed a new rope. recovering the exerciser.  ARED is again GO for nominal crew exercise.  
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Taipei, Taiwan (ISS pass for this target was just off shore over the Taiwan Strait in early afternoon.  This capital city with a metropolitan area population approaching 7 million is situated just inland on northern Taiwan astride Danshui River.  Looking just right of track for this target.  Fair weather was expected, but smog often prevents good views of this target), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (ISS had a near-nadir pass in mid-afternoon light and fair weather for this target as it tracked northeastward over Africa’s Rift Valley in central Ethiopia.  Addis Ababa has a population of more than 3 million.  As the capital of Ethiopia and home of the African Union, it has communities representing 80 nationalities and is growing rapidly.  CEO staff requested an overlapping set of images mapping the urban fringe where change is focused), and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (the capital city of the Dominican Republic with a population of 2.2 million lies on the south coast of the large Caribbean island of Hispaniola.  ISS pass was in the early afternoon with fair weather expected.  As ISS approached the island of Hispaniola from the southwest at this time, looking just right of track for Santo Domingo).
