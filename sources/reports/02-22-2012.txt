ISS On-Orbit Status 02/22/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
After wakeup this morning, CDR Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers &amp; FE-6 Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 30<sup>th</sup> for Dan, the 24<sup>th</sup> for André &amp; Don.   [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Don Pettit had Day 3 of his 3<sup>rd</sup> (FD60) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  After recording his diet input today, Don broke out and set up the equipment for the associated urine collections tomorrow (2/23).  Blood sampling will follow on Friday (2/24).       [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15<sup>th</sup> day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 &amp; 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-6 Pettit serviced the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 4 once every two hours for seven days.  Crew performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike Fossum’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.]
 
CDR Burbank conducted his 2<sup>nd</sup> session with the U.S. HMS VIS (Health Maintenance Systems / Visual Acuity) testing program which uses an eye chart for both far &amp; near visual acuity and an eye questionnaire (DCT/Data Collection Tool), to be filled out with test data and downloaded on a laptop for ground access.
 
FE-2 Ivanishin configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h5m session, his 2<sup>nd</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  FE-4 Kononenko took documentary photography.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
After CDR Burbank had set up the PFA (Portable Fan Assembly) for THC (Temperature &amp; Humidity Control) in the Node-2 vestibule to allow air to flow from Node-2 into COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-5 Kuipers adjusted the VCA2 (Video Camera Assembly 2) for video coverage and undertook the scheduled extensive cleanup of the COL ventilation systems, i.e., CFA1 (Cabin Fan Assembly 1) and ventilation ducts.     [Activities involved removal, inspection with the fiberscope and cleaning with the vacuum cleaner of CFA1, inlet muffler and check valve plus inspecting duct paths ‘A’ and ‘C’.]
 
Burbank, who assisted André in COL with fiberscoping the ducts and tilting the D1 rack forward for cleaning, also removed the rack’s knee braces and replaced them with the spare K-BAR (Knee Brace Assembly Replacement) hardware readied yesterday.  Dan &amp; André then safed COL for overnight and turned off the PFA.
 
In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), with the G1 camcorder taking video, FE-6 Pettit meanwhile worked on the MSPR (Multi-Purpose Small Payload Rack)’s combustion chamber, setting it up on the MSPR work bench and taking off its top plate to inspect the O-rings of 10 QDs (quick disconnects) visually and with the Otoscope, after removing each of their caps.  The chamber configuration was then restored, the Otoscope data were transferred and the MSPR worksite was closed out.      [An Otoscope (or Auriscope), consisting of a handle and a head, is a medical device used to look into the ears (outer &amp; middle ear).]
 
Working in the SM PkhO (Transfer Compartment), FE-1 Shkaplerov disassembled &amp; removed its old air duct and replaced it with a new one, supported by ground specialist tagup.
 
Anton &amp; Anatoly performed several hours of major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the TVIS treadmill, first taking it from its temporary overnight storage, then removing specific components from it and installing them on the new ISS Treadmill Assembly (which essentially replaces the old TVIS chassis).  At the end of the day, TVIS was installed back in the pit.       [The procedure had one crewmember remove the components from the old chassis while the other installed them on the new chassis.  Transferred components were stabilizers, SLD/SPD (Subject Loading Device/Subject Positioning Device) assemblies, the gyroscope, the electronics box with VIS (Vibration Isolation System) controller, and cables).]

Dan Burbank had ~1.5 hrs set aside to return the US EVA tools which were used in the Russian EVA-30 tools, to their stowage sites.
 
Anton Shkaplerov completed his 8<sup>th</sup> data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.         [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Don had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
Before Presleep, Burbank turned on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan was to turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
Before sleeptime, Pettit again closed the protective window shutters in the Lab, Node-3/Cupola and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) in preparation for ground-commanded SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) and SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) activities tonight and tomorrow night to perform surveys of the FGB.
 
CDR &amp; FE-6 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Don at ~11:15am, Dan at ~1:25pm EST.
 
At ~10:00am, Burbank &amp; Pettit supported an Educational PAO TV event, responding to questions from students at the Tri-District Curriculum Consortium, Newton, N.J.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4).    
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Calcutta, India (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  First of three close-spaced targets in South Asia which are obliterated by clouds for months at a time during the monsoon season.  Looking just left for Calcutta [14.1 million] which lies on the east bank of the Hooghly River, a smaller distributary in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta.  The Hooghly is the main visual cue since the city blends into the countryside), Ganges River Delta (the target stretches from under track well right of track.  Looking for the multitude of river channels forming the Mouths of the Ganges.  Dark mainly virgin mangrove forest on the seaward margin of the delta is a protected zone.  Immediately inland intensive croplands appear lighter toned.  Overlapping mapping frames of the current channels and shorelines of the delta were requested), Dhaka, Bangladesh (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  This megacity of 16.6 million lies of the combined Ganges-Brahmaputra waterway.  These waterways are major visual cues compared with the city), Sydney at night, Australia (CITIES AT NIGHT.   Ideal nadir pass―and possible cloud free opportunity―for night imaging of Sydney city lights.  Such images hold high value for the mapping of cityscapes and for quantitative estimates of population), Bridgetown, Barbados (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  Nadir pass.  The city lies on the southwest coast of the island.  Bridgetown is the capital and largest city of this island nation, with the population of the metro area of 96,578 [2006].  Barbados is the easternmost of the Lesser Antilles Archipelago), and Delhi and New Delhi, India, at night (CITIES AT NIGHT.   Looking left for this Indian megacity of nearly 17 million in the combined Delhi-New Delhi metro region.  The brightest zone may be the centrally located government zone (i.e. New Delhi), situated on the south side of the local river, which should appear as a dark strip snaking through the lights).
