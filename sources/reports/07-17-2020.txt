Food Physiology: The crew performed the Food Physiology briefing. The Integrated Impact of Diet on Human Immune Response, the Gut Microbiota, and Nutritional Status During Adaptation to Spaceflight (Food Physiology) experiment is designed to characterize the key effects of an enhanced spaceflight diet on immune function, the gut microbiome, and nutritional status indicators. These factors are interlinked, but diet is the only one that can be easily and meaningfully altered on Earth or during flight. This investigation aims to document the effect of dietary improvements on human physiology and the ability of those improvements to enhance adaptation to spaceflight.

Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: Today, the crew performed EVA activities as a continuation of yesterday’s EVA and the upcoming EVA on Tuesday, July 21st. They configured the BSA batteries for charging, performed a water recharge on the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs) and initiated EMU Metal Oxide cartridge regeneration. The crew also took additional photos of the EVA gloves per Engineering request. Finally, the crew completed their EVA procedure reviews and participated in an EVA procedure review conference.
Post- EVA Periodic Health Exam (PHS): Today the crew completed a health evaluation. During the evaluation, vital signs are obtained and an ear examination is conducted by taking images of the tympanic membranes and the external ear. The data and imagery is then downlinked for review by a medical specialist. PHS exams are conducted within 24 hours of the conclusion of EVA.
Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) Brine Filter:  As part of regular maintenance, the ISS crew opened up the UPA Fill Drain Valve Enclosure and removed the installed/old Brine Filter and replaced it with a new Brine Filter. Brine Filters are replaced every 60 days.
