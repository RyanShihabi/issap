Boeing CST-100 Crewed Flight Test (CFT): The CFT crew performed a variety of systems activities to assist the ISS crew. The crew completed Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) Troubleshooting, Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Airlock Deconfiguring, and an activity to remove the UPA Pressure Control and Pump Assembly (PCPA) Motor from PCPA SN007 in support of the PCPA Motor Remove & Replace (R&R).
Payloads:
Fluid Science Laboratory Soft Matter Dynamics-Compaction and Sound Transmission in Dense Granular Media (FSL-SMD-COMPGRAN): The CompGran-3 Science Sample (FM02) in position 2 and the Reference Sample in position 3 were swapped inside the experiment container moving tray. More information on this experiment can be found here.
Zero Robotics-Astrobee: The crew positioned the Astrobee Free Flyer in the JEM and assisted the ground team in conducting multiple gesture-recognition software test runs. More information on this experiment can be found here.
Systems:
In Flight Maintenance (IFM) PCPA SN007 Motor Removal: This week, in order to ensure a functional PCPA spare exists on-board the ISS, the crew is performing a maintenance procedure to R&R a PCPA Motor. Today, the crew removed the motor from PCPA SN007. In the coming days, the crew will remove the failed motor from PCPA SN002, then install the motor from PCPA SN007 into the housing of PCPA SN002. Another spare PCPA is also planned to arrive in August on the Cygnus NG-21 vehicle.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Troubleshooting: Yesterday’s Radio Frequency Group (RFG) Retrieval 2.5 EVA was terminated shortly following Airlock Hatch opening and prior to crew egress due to an Airlock Service and Cooling Umbilical (SCU) water leak. Today, the crew completed an activity to inspect and troubleshoot the EMU 3003 SCU water leak. The ground team continues to assess forward steps. 
EVA Preparation Operations: The crew performed various activities in preparation for the upcoming EVA. The crew completed EVA Procedure Print, EVA Procedure Review, EVA Tool Configuring, and EVA Battery Removal, Charging, and Installation. These activities are in preparation for the upcoming Common Communications for Visiting Vehicle (C2V2), Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA), and DC-DC Converter Unit (DDCU) (CARD) EVA.
