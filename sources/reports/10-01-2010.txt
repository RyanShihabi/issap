ISS On-Orbit Status 10/01/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
 
  At wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  CDR Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 5<sup>th</sup> for both of them, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Walker was into Day 2 of her current 4-day session on the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 4<sup>th</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  Wheelock had Day 1 of his new Pro K session, his 4<sup>th</sup> on board.      [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
  In the SM (Service Module), Yurchikhin used the Russian FSS “Uragan” (hurricane) hardware for simultaneous spectrometry of the Strelets Steppe Preserve in the vicinity of the City of Kursk and the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant, taking track imagery of the Kursk target area to the Strelets Preserve.     [The FSS system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  The orbital imagery is supported by a field team on the ground in the Preserve till 10/4.  For today’s session, Fyodor last night charged and checked the ME/Electronics Module &amp; MRI/Image Recording Module batteries and also set up the FSS science hardware near window #9.]
 
  Walker &amp; Wheelock wrapped up the T2/COLBERT treadmill IFM (Inflight Maintenance), aligning and centering the rack in its location in Node-3 while taking photography for ground verification of proper rack seating.  Wheels then secured the thumbwheel and Y-axis jam nuts with tie wraps and safety wire.    [The Y-axis jam nuts have been known to come loose after a while.]
 
  Afterwards, the CDR set up video camcorders in Node-1 &amp; Node-3 to record the subsequent unmanned ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout) run of the T2 treadmill from two angles.    [Manned ACO is on schedule for tomorrow.] 
 
  FE-6 Walker &amp; Wheelock then re-installed the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) Kabin enclosure in Node-3.
 
  Other activities completed by Shannon Walker on her very busy job list today were –

Recorded are      the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages,      cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup,      vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and      vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient      intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground      specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly      estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not      need to be tracked daily], and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Performing the regular      weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp;      Stabilization)  [primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs      (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for      fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required,      plus recording time &amp; date values].</li> </ul> 
  Doug Wheelock meanwhile completed the weekly 10-min. CWC inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (24-0007L) lists 122 CWCs (2,792.2 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (24 CWCs with 998.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 712.7 L in 17 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 128.3 L in 3 bags for flushing only with microbial filter, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only; 2. potable water (5 CWCs with 215.4 L, of which 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 1 bag with 42.5 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use;  3. iodinated water (84 CWCs with 1,550.1 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (6.3 L, in 1 bag with 6.3 L to be used only for OGA, plus 6 empty bags; and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (22.2 L, in 1 CWC with 20.2 L from hose/pump flush &amp; 1 bag with 2.00 L from EMU dump).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
  Wheels also broke out and prepared the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware, including MBS (Mixing Bag System), for his 4<sup>th</sup> session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, integrated with Thermolab, scheduled next Monday (10/4).    [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated],
 
  Yurchikhin performed the periodic switch of the two Russian Regul/Paket email (radiogram) channels, today from Regul-OC String 1 to backup String 2.
 
  Later, Fyodor completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  At ~4:02am EDT, FE-5 Yurchikhin led the crew in supporting a Russian PAO TV activity, downlinking messages of greetings &amp; congratulations to 2 events – Mission Control Center-Moscow on TsUP’s 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary, and a World Teacher’s Event at the Kremlin.     [(1)  In October, TsUP will be celebrating its 50-th anniversary.  “We believe that we have the right to call you that because specialists with the TsNIIMash Mission Control Center are a reliable pillar firmly planted in the Earth for the ISS crew. We feel taken care of by you, day or night.  We are connected to you by intangible but strong threads of data streams.  Real-time processing of data coming into the Mission Control Center, data analysis and decision making are a guarantee that the crew will operate as one, that research will bear fruit, and that we will be safe… Dear friends, we are confident of your professionalism, reliability, and responsibility.  We know that when you send us off into flight your heart is light and that when you expect us back, you are as excited about and anxious for our safe return as members of our families.     (2) On 10/5 there will be an event in the Kremlin Palace to celebrate the World Teachers' Day instituted by UNESCO in 1994.  “We offer our most heartfelt greetings to you from Earth orbit and congratulations for this wonderful holiday, Teachers' Day!  A teacher is a very important person in all our lives!  A teacher is greater than simply an occupation. It is a vocation. Doing your work and serving as paragons of wisdom and justice, you lay the foundations for many generations' view of the world. There is no other occupation that requires this degree commitment, patience, steadfastness, and emotional charge.  We know that on this International Teachers' Day educators from all over Russia are gathered in the Kremlin Palace, - gathered to celebrate all the teachers in the country as well as the winner of the annual Teacher of the Year award. We join in all the greetings you will receive this day… Happiness, health, and joy to you!”]
 
  At ~4:30am, Fyodor Yurchikhin held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
  At ~1:05pm, Shannon had her regular IMS (Inventory Management System) stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
  At ~2:45pm, the crew will hold their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston.
 
  At ~3:50pm, Wheels is scheduled for his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-6) and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).
 
  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Dili, East Timor (Timore Leste) (ISS had a nadir-viewing pass over this Southeast Asian capital city, located on the northern coastline of East Timor.  Some scattered clouds may have been present.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural areas were requested), Baghdad, Iraq (ISS had a nadir-viewing overpass of Baghdad.  General context views of the urban area will provide context for higher resolution imagery), Asmara, Eritrea (weather was predicted to be clear over this capital city.  The city is located on the northwestern edge of the Great Rift Valley of Africa.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural areas were requested), Bujumbura, Burundi (some scattered clouds may have been present at the time of this nadir-viewing overpass of this capital city.  The city is located on the northeastern shore of Lake Tanganyika.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural area were requested), Mount Rainier, WA (looking to the right of track for this large stratovolcano located.  Overlapping mapping frames of glaciers on the volcano summit and flanks are of particular interest), and Volcan Colima, Mexico (ISS had a nadir-viewing overpass of this active volcano.  Well-defined debris flows extending from the summit mark the active Volcan Colima.  Another stratovolcano, Nevada de Colima, is adjacent to the north.  Overlapping mapping frames of the Volcan Colima summit and flanks are useful for geologic mapping and geohazard analysis).
