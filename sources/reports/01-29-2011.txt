ISS On-Orbit Status 01/29/11
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Progress 41P arrival.  
 
 Sleep cycle shift:  To accommodate the docking of the new cargo ship Progress M-09M/41P (#409) tonight at ~9:39pm EST, crew wake/sleep cycle changes are in effect, featuring today a 4-hr “nap” &amp; 30-min “snack”, and a low-activity Saturday.
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Wake –  4:30am EST (this morning, delayed 3.5 hrs)</li><li>Lunch – 10:00am-11:00am</li><li>Midday nap – 11:00am-3:00pm</li><li>Snack – 6:30pm-7:00pm</li><li>Sleep –  3:30am (tomorrow morning, 1/30) for a very long “sleep”</li><li>Wake – 1:00am (Monday, 1/31, returning to “normal”).</li> </ul> 
 FE-4 Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Before sleeptime tomorrow morning, Dmitri will inspect the filters again, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 CDR Scott Kelly continued another week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Scott’s 7<sup>th</sup> session, transferring data from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, US crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Also at wake-up, Kelly, FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift (therefore, for the next sleep shift sequence RST is scheduled twice daily. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Scott, Dmitri, Paolo &amp; Cady completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
 Kondratyev completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
 Later, Dmitri also performed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems (UOV) in the SM &amp; FGB, cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
 
 At ~9:30am EST, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
 Cady Coleman initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.    [This was the 13<sup>th</sup> session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 Nespoli unstowed and prepared the equipment for his 3<sup>rd</sup> sessions of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.     [Paolo retrieved controlled diet menu items, assembled daily consumables, and pre-positioned them to ensure successful completion of ProK Controlled Diet.]
 
 Paolo &amp; Cady filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise (for CDR, FE-5, FE-6) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, F-4, FE-5, FE-6) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6).  Exercise for FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE-4 was reduced today due to the Progress docking activities. 
 
 At ~5:25am, Paolo powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 5:30am conducted a ham radio session with students at "Alessandro Cialdi" school in Civitavecchia, Rome, Italy.    
 
 CDR, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Cady at ~7:45am, Paolo at ~8:40am, Scott at ~11:50am EST.
 
 After their 4-hr “midday nap”, the crewmembers make final preparations for the arrival of Progress M-09M/41P, tonight at ~9:39pm, at the DC1 nadir port:
 
 Kelly &amp; Kondratyev set up the Ku-band video “scheme” for covering the Progress docking.      [Scott activates the FGB-based A31p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for the TV conversion to NTSC &amp; Ku-band of the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera via the MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder from FGB &amp; SM (Service Module), in order to downlink “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.  Dima meanwhile sets up and checks out the RSS1 (SSC-1) laptop at the TsP (Central post) for monitoring the imagery during the MPEG-2 channel transmission.]
 
 Coleman shuts down the amateur/ham radio equipment (~4:00pm) to prevent RF interference with the Progress KURS radio control system, while Kelly closes the protective shutters of the Lab, Kibo &amp; Cupola science windows.
 
 Also before docking, Skripochka will activate &amp; verify proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the Progress 41P docking.  The data are later copied to a USB stick, the archive cleared, and the data downlinked to the ground.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
 Automated approach &amp; docking will be monitored from the SM by Kaleri &amp; Skripochka on the TORU manual teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system in case automated control is aborted.
 
 After the cargo ship’s docking, Alex &amp; Dmitri shut off the TORU, and reconfigure the STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to normal ops.     [The "Voskhod-M" STTS enables telephone communications between the SM, FGB, DC-1 and USOS, and also with users on the ground over VHF channels selected by an operator at an SM comm panel, via STTS antennas on the SM’s outside.  There are six comm panels in the SM with pushbuttons for accessing any of three audio channels, plus an intercom channel.  Other modes of the STTS include telegraphy (teletype), EVA voice, emergency alarms, Packet/Email, and TORU docking support].
 
 The crewmembers then conduct the standard one-hour leak checking of the docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and the SM Transfer Compartment.
 
 Later today, the Russian crewmembers –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Open the hatches (~1:30am) and install the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling; </li><li>Perform the standard air sampling inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M air sampler; </li><li>Power down the spacecraft and installing the ventilation/heating air duct; </li><li>Take photographs of the internal docking surfaces for subsequent downlinking, and</li><li>Dismantle the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC1.  [The StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB and DC-1.]</li> </ul> 
 FE-4 will also service the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet, downloading structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer before undocking to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.      [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.]
 
 Afterwards, Dmitri supports the ground-commanded reactivation of the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator by monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.     [Elektron was turned off by the ground during the docking.  The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]
