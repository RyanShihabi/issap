ISS On-Orbit Status 02/11/11
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.        
 
 FE-4 Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Before sleeptime, Dmitri will inspect the filters again, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Also at wake-up, CDR Kelly, FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 9<sup>th</sup> for Scott, the 10<sup>th</sup> for Cady &amp; Paolo.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Cady Coleman concluded her 3<sup>rd</sup> (FD60) NUTRITION w/Repository/Pro K 24-hr urine collection period, with samples deposited in MELFI.  Additionally, Cady underwent the associated generic blood draw, with Paolo Nespoli assisting with the phlebotomy.  FE-6 then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI.     [The operational products for blood &amp; urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
 All six crewmembers took the monthly O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.      [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There has been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.]
 
 Scott Kelly completed his 5<sup>th</sup> onboard session with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.       [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
 Dmitri Kondratyev took his 2<sup>nd</sup> MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) test, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, along with PZEh-MO-8 body mass measurement using the IM device.  Oleg Skripochka shot documentary photography.      [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM (Service Module), the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with Dima’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.]
 
 As part of the regular physical fitness check prior to an Orlan spacewalk, Skripochka undertook a session with the MedOps protocol MO-5, “Cardiovascular Evaluation during Graded Exercises” on the VELO cycle ergometer, a standard Russian fitness test, assisted by Kondratyev as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Afterwards, the two Flight Engineers switched places, with Dmitri becoming the subject and Oleg the CMO.       [The 50-min assessment (per person), supported by ground specialist tagup via VHF and telemetry monitoring from RGS (Russian Ground Site, 12:00pm &amp; 1:33pm EST) uses the Gamma-1 ECG (electrocardiograph) equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels.  For the graded exercise, the subject works the pedals after a prescribed program at load settings of 125, 150, and 175 watts for three minutes each.  Data output involves a kinetocardiogram, rheoplethysmogram, rheoencephalogram and a temporal pulsogram.]
 
 FE-2 serviced the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet, downloading structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer during the HTV2 docking and subsequent transfer operations to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.      [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.]
 
 FE-5 Nespoli worked in the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), performing the periodic changeout of the urine receptacle (UR) and insert filter (IF) with new units.      [WHC was unavailable for use during this activity.]
 
 FE-6 Coleman accessed the WRS (Water Recovery System) and reconfigured the setup for the periodic RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) backfill with a QD (Quick Disconnect) hose, which was then stowed and the RFTA activity closed out,
 
 Afterwards Cady configured the WHC to feed the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) for processing, instead of an EDV-U container.
 
 FE-2 Skripochka &amp; FE-4 Kondratyev continued their preparations for the Orlan EVA-28, performing further Orlan spacesuit activities in the DC1 “Pirs” Docking Compartment.  
 Oleg (Orlan #4) &amp; Dmitri (Orlan #5) today –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Readied Orlan spacesuit replaceable elements &amp; equipment (SMEG),</li><li>Ran leak checks &amp; valve functionality tests on the Orlans and their BSS interface units in the DC1 &amp; SM PkhO (Transfer Compartment) from the EVA support panels (POV);</li><li>Conducted pressure checks on the SM BK-3 O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) tanks and the BNP portable repress O<sub>2</sub> tank in the DC-1 airlock module, and</li><li>Studied EVA-28 procedures.</li> </ul> [Tasks for EVA-28 consist of removal of two Komplast panels (#2, #10) from the FGB, installation of the new RK-21-8 SVCh-Radiometriya experiment system on the URM-D portable multipurpose workstation on Plane II of the SM Work Compartment 2, removal of the Ferrozond foot restraint from its location on the SM Work Compartment 2, and assembly &amp; connection of the Molniya-GAMMA equipment on the URM-D on Plane IV of the SM Work Compartment 2, and launching the Radioskaf-V nanosatellite delivered on Progress 41P.  Two items will be jettisoned; three other items (Molniya MLI and cover) will be brought back inside.]
 
 Paolo Nespoli terminated the maintenance discharge/recharge cycle of the EMU batteries in the US Airlock BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly).
 
 Alex Kaleri meanwhile readied the Progress M-09M/41P (#409) docked at the DC1 nadir port for undocking if required in an EVA-28 contingency.  Steps included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Installing the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC1 nadir port   [the StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB, MRM2 and DC1],</li><li>Activating the spacecraft’s electronics and taking out the ventilation/heating air duct; </li><li>Closing the hatches; </li><li>Removing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) which rigidized the joint,</li><li>Starting the standard one-hour leak checking of the SU docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and DC1, and</li><li>Downlinking the video depicting the close-out activities, for review by ground specialists.   [During hatch closure, leak checking and initial clamp installation, Russian thrusters as usual were inhibited due to load constraints.]</li> </ul> 
 In the Lab, Scott Kelly &amp; Paolo Nespoli continued the routing &amp; installation of the SGANT coaxial cabling for the spare Ku-band started yesterday, completing Part 2 of the outfitting in the Lab Port-Deck Standoff, then closing out the work sites.    [This new cable provides transmit/receive capability to the redundant Ku-Band Antenna installed on ULF4.  Once installed, the redundant Ku-Band Antenna will require two cables to be swapped whenever it is put into service.  A full checkout is planned following ULF5.]
 
 Afterwards, Nespoli repositioned the CMRS (Crew Medical Restraint System) in its nominal place, from which it had to be moved out of the way for the Lab P6, D6, D4 &amp; D2 rack rotations for the cable routing, and replaced the other equipment (e.g., OpsLAN) previously relocated.    [The board-like CMRS allows strapping down a patient on the board with a harness for medical attention by the CMO who is also provided with restraints around the device.  The device can be secured to the ISS structure within two minutes to provide a patient restraint surface for performing emergency medical procedures, such as during ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support).  It can also be used to transport a patient between the station and the Orbiter middeck.  It isolates the crew and equipment electrically during defibrillations and pacing electrical discharges, accommodates the patient in the supine zero-G positions, provides cervical spine stabilization and, for a three-person crew, can also restrain two CMOs during their delivery of medical care.]
 
 Working on the MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2), the CDR removed the failed EU (Electronic Unit) for pre-pack &amp; return to the ground and inserted the spare EU from MELFI-3 instead.
 
 At MELFI-1, Scott removed the failed EU from the MELFI-1 spare location and closed out the empty rack location.
 
 On the CubeLab, the CDR performed the periodic Module data collection session and transferred files of collected data to laptop for downlink.      [CubeLab is a low-cost 1-kg platform for educational projects.  It is a multipurpose research facility that interfaces small standard modules into the ERs (EXPRESS Racks).  The modules can be used within the pressurized space station environment in orbit, with a nominal length, width, and height of 100 mm and a mass of no more than 1 g.  Up to 16 CubeLab modules can be inserted into a CubeLab insert inside an ER.]
 
 FE-6 Coleman filled out her weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 Cady also supported the BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) payload in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) by conducting the periodic camera/flash setup status check without SSC (Station Support Computer) on the running BCAT-5 with Sample 9.     [The checkup includes image transfer, camera battery and camera/flash position.  It is scheduled every other day when possible, starting at INIT + 1 day during automated photography.]
 
 Skripochka serviced the running Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9, downloading the recorded session data for downlink.    [The FSS system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module.]
 
 Paolo Nespoli started the first day of his first SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) session, which entails a series of diet intake loggings, body mass measurements and blood &amp; urine samplings in two session blocks.      [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Mike will have to eat special diet (Session 1: High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level and Session 2: Low salt diet).  Solo Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are being logged on sheets stowed in the PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) Consumable Kit in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  SOLO, an ESA/German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device).  Blood samples are taken with the PCBA.    Background:  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
 Sasha Kaleri handled the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Oleg Skripochka conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
 At ~3:20am EST, the crew held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
 At ~7:40am, Cady powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 7:45am conducted a ham radio session with students at Lillestrom Videregaende Skole, Lillestrom, Norway.
 
 At ~7:45am, Alex Kaleri linked up with TsUP/Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
 At 12:55pm, Coleman &amp; Nespoli participated in a teleconference with ground specialists responding to debriefing questions on HTV2 rendezvous, capture &amp; berthing plus EP (Exposed Pallet) activities.
 
 At ~2:10pm, the six crewmembers were scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director or ISS at JSC/MCC-Houston.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4).
