ISS Reboost: Today, the ISS performed a reboost using the 81 Progress 8 R&D thrusters. This reboost is one of several reboosts setting up phasing for 67 Soyuz 2-Orbit rendezvous and 68 Soyuz landing in March. The burn duration was 12 minutes 3 seconds with a Delta-V of 1.20 m/s and a total of 214kg of propellant was consumed.
Payloads:
NanoRacks Module-9:  Mixing tube assemblies were activated to facilitate Module-9 experiments.  NanoRacks Module-9 is a module containing a complement of Mixture Tubes. These Mixture Tubes each contain a separate experiment that can be activated and deactivated while in zero-G. Tubes are a low-cost, high-return science opportunity for students to send experiments to the ISS and encompass a wide range of science/disciplines. Mixture Tubes are very popular with middle and high school science programs and have also been used by private company research, technical schools, and individual research.
Systems:
USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: Today, the crew reviewed all detailed procedures, tool configurations, and additional references in preparation of the upcoming 3A IROSA (ISS Roll Out Solar Array) EVA on December 3rd. They then participated in a conference with ground teams to further discuss operations and EVA timelines. 
Robotics Operations: Last night, ground teams powered up the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) and translated the Mobile Transporter (MT) from worksite 2 to worksite 4. Ground teams then performed a Dragon trunk survey and checkout of all trunk cameras. Today, the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) grappled and removed the IROSA from the SpX Dragon trunk. Teams then performed a video survey and installed the hardware onto the Payload ORU Accommodation (POA).
