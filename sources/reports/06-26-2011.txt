ISS On-Orbit Status 06/26/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Crew off-duty.  Ahead: Week 15 of Increment 27/28.
 
FE-4 Volkov tended the current experiment with the Russian/German KPT-21 Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall/PK-3+) payload, running in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, by checking the hermeticity of the evacuated EB vacuum chamber after wakeup and before bedtime (any pressure increase above the vacuum should stay within 5 mmHg).  With STTS onboard comm temporarily configured for MRM2 occupancy, Sergei tested the equipment with ground specialist tagup support, then terminated the experiment and reset STTS.      [Main objective of PK-3 is to study wave propagation and dispersion ratio in a dust plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber, at a specified power of HF discharge, pressure, and a varied number of particles.]
 
CDR Borisenko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.      [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
Andrey also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP
 
Before sleeptime, FE-6 Fossum will transfer HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) and EarQ software data files from the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for downlink to the ground.      [Since MEC files cannot be pulled down directly by the ground after the recent SSCv4 software transition, the crew has to transfer the files to a USB drive and from there to an SSC server for subsequent downlink.]
 
For his chosen VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activity, FE-5 Furukawa conducted Part 2 of the current new JAXA life science experiment CsPINs (Dynamism of Auxin Efflux Facilitators responsible for Gravity-regulated Growth and Development in Cucumber) by starting Run 2-3.       [Yesterday’s steps included preparing CsPINs cucumber samples in two CsPINs Chamber As, inserting them in two MEU Bs (Measurement Experiment Units B, #004, #005) for Run 2-3 of the CsPINs experiment and finally attaching these in the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) 1G incubator for ~18 hrs for germination.  Today, Satoshi retrieved three KFTs (Kennedy Fixation Tubes, #401, #402, #902) from MELFI 1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1), detached the MEU Bs from the CBEF IU (Incubation Unit), inserted the samples in the KFTs for fixation in AAE (Acetic Acid Ethanol) and stored them in MELFI at +2 degC.  Background: CsPINs studies the phenomenon of tropism, i.e., the growth or turning movement of a biological organism, usually a plant, in response to an environmental stimulus.  Specifically focusing on gravity, the new JAXA experiment investigates how plants sense gravity as an environmental signal and use it for governing their morphology and growth orientation.  CsPINs plays an important role in the regulation of gravity-dependent redistribution of auxin (a class of plant hormones) and thereby controls gravimorphogenesis (peg formation) in cucumber (Cucmis sativus L.) seedlings.  Gravitropism also interferes with hydrotropism in cucumber roots, in which the dynamism of these facilitators may also play a role.  Cucumber (Cucmis sativus) seedlings are used to analyze the effect of gravity on the expressions of CsPINs and unravel their contributions to peg formation.  Hydrotropism is differentiated from gravitropism in roots, and the expressions of CsPINs are compared to determine the interacting mechanism between the two tropisms.] 
 
At ~9:25am EDT, Andrey, Sasha &amp; Sergei used the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) for the 2<sup>nd</sup> radio session (after yesterday) with the participants of the International Youth Meeting “АТР-2011. Altai. Points of Growth” (about 300 participants, all prospective managers in the area of politics, business, culture and art.
 
The six crewmembers had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Satoshi at ~3:45am, Sergei at ~6:30am, Andrey at ~9:25am, Sasha at ~10:40am, Ron at ~11:30am, Mike at ~3:15pm.

The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).
 
No CEO targets uplinked for today.
