After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops.
 
FE-5 Williams had Day 5 of her 4<sup>th</sup> (FD120) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  In addition to closing out the associated 24-hr urine sample collections, Sunita today also underwent the generic blood draw, assisted by Akihiko Hoshide, then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the JPM MELFI (JEM Pressurized Module Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Later, Suni stowed the equipment used for the urine and blood collections.       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.]
 
Yuri Malenchenko supported the overnight run of the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) in the SM by copying the data collected overnight from the RSE-SLS A31p laptop to the RSS2 laptop for data downlink and log file dump, supported by ground specialist tagup.  Later tonight, before sleeptime, Yuri will activate the RSE-LCS laptop again to commence recording for TEKh-39 LCS.
 
Aki Hoshide serviced the WRS (Water Recovery System) in Node-3, manually transferring urine from an EDV-U container (#1029) to the Recycle Tank, then reconfiguring the QD (quick disconnect) depress hose and filling the UPA WSTA (Urine Processor Assembly / Waste Storage Tank Assembly). The depress hose along with the tank’s vent adapter were then removed for nominal UPA processing and returned to stowage.  Desired offload quantity: 70% of WSTA or until #1029 was empty.       [During such transfers, the crewmember always wears protective safety goggles, dust mask and nitrile gloves.]
 
FE-4 completed the routine daily &amp; weekly servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.      [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SPKU SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings of SM &amp; FGB for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian SGO sanitary &amp; hygienic equipment, POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers as required.]
 
At ~5:00am EDT, Aki Hoshide had a 15-min CDE (Crew Discretionary Event) downlink.
 
FE-4 &amp; FE-6 held their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Yuri at ~6:15am, Aki at ~11:45am EDT.
 
The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [CDR &amp; FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed T2 (interval, 2 min.), with ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.) and T2 (int., 4 min.) for the next 4 days.  Aki’s protocol for today showed ARED/T2 (cont.), with T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/T2 (cont.) and T2 (int., 4 min.) on the following 4 days.]
 
Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –

CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were St. Helena Island, Atlantic Ocean (HMS Beagle Site:  Darwin and the Beagle arrived at St. Helena Island on July 8, 1836 and remained for 5 days to explore its geology. The crew began looking for this target a little early, because due to its remoteness and small size [47 square miles], there are no visual cues of the island during ISS approach.  As ISS progressed on its descending pass from the NW, the crew was to look towards nadir for this small island. There may have been a few clouds in the region, they but tried for detailed shots), Taipei, Taiwan at Night (Cities at Night: ISS pass for this target was just off shore over the Taiwan Strait at night. This capital city, with a metropolitan area population approaching 7 million, is situated just inland on northern Taiwan astride Danshui River.  Looking left of track for this target.  Fair weather was expected, but smog often prevents good views of this target), Beijing, China at Night (Cites at Night: As ISS tracked NE over China and towards the coastline, the crew was to look just left of track to capture night imagery of the city. Beijing is the capital of China and one of the most populous cities in the world. Trying to acquire a shot of the entire city in one frame), and Kingman Reef, Pacific Ocean (Coral Reefs Site: ISS/CEO photography remains a major component in efforts to map, monitor, and study coral reefs worldwide.  The crew had a pass over the Kingman Reef in fair weather and mid-morning light. This 4 mile-long, V-shaped atoll is located in the Equatorial Pacific roughly halfway between the Hawaiian Islands and American Samoa. At this time, as ISS approached it from the NW, the crew was to begin looking for this uniquely shaped and northernmost of the Line Island Archipelago in the central Pacific, which was left of track).
