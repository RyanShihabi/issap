ISS On-Orbit Status 10/31/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.        Underway:  Week 7 of Increment 29 (three-person crew).
 
FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Sergey also conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
At wake-up, CDR Mike Fossum &amp; FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Also early in Postsleep, Furukawa &amp; Fossum undertook their 20<sup>th</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.        [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
The CDR checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera &amp; flashlight battery charge and later in the day performed additional checks on the payload, looking for crystals, changing camera battery, downloading images and restarting the Intervalometer for automated flash photography.  The SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM software is not being used for this run.      [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking a photo of the turbid Sample 1 every hour.  While Sample 1 is running, crystal checks on Samples 6-10 will be performed each day.  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.]
 
In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Mike powered up the SDRM (SpaceDRUMS/Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix) payload on ER-5 (EXPRESS Rack 5) and turned it off again about 5 hrs later after resource tracking by POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center), which is an unattended activity to track power, medium rate data, and analog video usage.      [SpaceDRUMS suspends a baseball-sized solid or liquid sample using 20 acoustic beam emitters during combustion or heat-based synthesis.  Materials can be produced in microgravity with an unparalleled quality of shape and composition.  SpaceDRUMS will support scientific understanding of processes like combustion synthesis and self-propagating high temperature synthesis and also provide direct commercial benefits from materials processing.  Advanced ceramics, polymer, and colloids can be processed in SpaceDRUMS.]
 
Afterwards, Fossum performed regular maintenance calibration on the sensors of the two CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1043 &amp; #1048.
 
Sergey Volkov took documentary photographs in the SM with the Nikon D2Х camera with 17-55 mm lens &amp; flash plus video with the Sony HVR-Z7T camcorder for downlink to the ground.     [Imagery was obtained of equipment and structural elements with a panoramic view of the Central Post, followed by special work areas and attachment points, including any damage if found.] 
 
Later, Sergey prepared the RSS2 laptop for transmitting the SM imagery to TsUP-Moscow via the Russian RSPI high-speed Radio Link Data Transmission System.
 
FE-4 also performed the periodic (every Monday) verification of the automatic IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2, as well as the manual update on the non-network laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.  Before the recent (8/8) installation of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p &amp; RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.]
 
FE-5 Furukawa conducted periodic water sampling activities for Week 7, including –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">The periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose;  [after the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">“Week 7” water sample collecting in Node-3 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient &amp; Hot ports for microbial inflight &amp; TOCA analysis plus a post-flight sample for return on Soyuz 27S;   [from Ambient: 1 TOCA in-flight sample (250 mL), 1 post-flight sample (500 mL) &amp; 1 microbial in-flight sample (125 mL); from Hot: 1 post-flight sample (500 mL).  The in-flight samples were subsequently processed in the MCD (Microbial Capture Device) and CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection.  After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">“Week 7” water sampling from the WRS (Water Recovery System) potable water in the SM for chemical &amp; microbial analysis, using a specific water sample collection packet from stowage;   [collected were one 500 mL post-flight sample from the SVO-ZV port for return on 27S and two 125 mL microbial in-flight samples from the SVO-ZV and SRV-K ports].</li></ul>Sergey Volkov completed his first preliminary orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test session with the Russian Chibis (“Lapwing”) suit by conducting the MedOps MO-4 exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill, assisted by Satoshi Furukawa as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Sergey was supported in his one-hour session by ground specialist tagup via VHF at 6:13am.      [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.] 
 
Afterwards, Sergey collected air samples for return on 27S, using a Russian AK-1M absorber in the SM for air as well as IPD-CO Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (carbon monoxide).
 
Volkov also spent ~2 hrs in the FGB, collecting microflora samples from equipment and structures at 24 different locations.  Samples were taken with swabs, secured in tubes and labeled for location &amp; date for return to the ground on 27S. 
 
Satoshi completed another session with the psychological POMS (Profile of Mood States) experiment, completing his questionnaire for downlink to ground specialist.
 
In the US Lab, Mike set up the EarthKAM (EK/Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload components at the WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack and activated the camera and software.     [This had to be done during orbit day since the crew needs to see the ground for proper camera focusing.  EK is using a Nikon D2Xs electronic still camera with 50mm (f/1.4) lens at the Lab window, powered by 16Vdc from a 28V DC adapter, taking pictures by remote operation from the ground, without crew interaction.  EarthKAM is an education program that enables thousands of students to photograph and examine Earth from the unique perspective of space, integrating the excitement of ISS with middle-school education.  The student requests are uplinked in a camera control file to an A31p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop which then activates the camera (wireless) at specified times and receives the digital images from the camera’s storage card on its hard drive, for subsequent downlink via OPS LAN. This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> use of the NIKON D2Xs camera by EK.  The experiment uses the new EarthKAM software on an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop which replaced the earlier version used for the KODAK DCS 760 camera.]
 
Fossum also performed the periodic transfer of urine from an EDV-U container to the UPA WSTA (Urine Processor Assembly / Waste Storage Tank Assembly) for UPA processing, using the Russian Compressor-M powered by a Ku-band power supply, then tore down the setup.      [During such transfers, the crewmember always wears protective safety goggles, dust mask and nitrile gloves.]
 
Furukawa performed the periodic check of the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) exercise machine’s four isolators for wear &amp; tear, checking for cable stop wear and wire pulling back into cable stop,
 
FE-4 conducted the periodic inspection of the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor’s sediment trap insert (VU) in the SM.      [The VU insert was replaced with a spare on 6/3.  The Russian SRVK-2M converts collected condensate into drinking water and dispenses the reclaimed potable water.]
 
Afterwards, Sergey completed routine preventive maintenance on the SM Rodnik water storage system, opening and closing the KN water &amp; KV pressurization valves from the Rodnik control panel.     [The procedure of activating each valve twice is intended to keep the valves functional during long-term water storage.],
 
Volkov also did the daily routine servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
The CDR conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 &amp; O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.
 
Before sleeptime, Fossum &amp; Furukawa will take turns as subjects for ocular research with a PanOptic eye test which requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination, performed by the two crewmembers on each other as operator with an ophthalmoscope.  Done last time: 10/6.        [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still &amp; video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula &amp; optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.  Prior to the test, Mike sets up the equipment including video camera, and afterwards Satoshi downloads the data, then disassembles &amp; stows the gear.]
 
At ~10:50am, Mike powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 10:55am conducted a ham radio session with students at the Kantonsschule in Zug, Switzerland.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR).
 
Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Continuing the preparation &amp; downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Taking care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Another ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.</li></ul> 
JAXA Marangoni Experiment:   This week, JAXA will perform the Marangoni Experiment each night on 10/31, 11/1, 11/3, and "LONG" liquid bridges will be developed on 10/31 and 11/1. Tonight, at 5:30pm-2:00am, the crew should pay scrupulous attention to not to generate disturbances since taller liquid bridges are much more sensitive to g-jitter. 
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
