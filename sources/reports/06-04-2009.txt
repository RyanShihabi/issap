ISS On-Orbit Status 06/04/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    A short day for the Exp-20 crew due to the early EVA-22 egress tomorrow morning (2:45am EDT).  First Anniversary of the JAXA JPM – happy birthday, Kibo!
 
 EVA-22 sleep cycle shift:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Wake today – 2:00am;      sleep – 9:30am;  </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Wake tonight –      6:10pm; sleep on 6/5 – 1:25pm; </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Wake on 6/6 –      2:00am.</li> </ul> 
  Upon wakeup, FE-3 Roman Romanenko terminated his first experiment session for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/SONOKARD, by taking the recording device from his SONOKARD sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-MED laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [SONOKARD objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
  FE-4 Bob Thirsk &amp; FE-5 Frank DeWinne continued their first session of sleep logging for the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a 7-day-long session.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, Bob &amp; Frank wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, and they use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  FE-1 Mike Barratt set up camera equipment in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) to provide an additional video view to the ground during the subsequent JEMRMS (Robotic Manipulator System) operations preparatory to the arrival and berthing of the JEF (JEM Exposed Facility) and JLE (JEM Logistics Module – Exposed Section).
 
  Working in the Kibo laboratory, FE-2 Koichi Wakata then –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Reconfigured JEMRMS RLT-BU      (Robotics Laptop Terminal Backup) cables for subsequent BU activation, </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Conducted a review of the      DOUG application for the following maneuvers, </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Activated the JEMRMS and      Arm Bus Monitor,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Checked out the RMS by      maneuvering the MA (Main Arm) first to the Bonding Tab Removal position,      then to the JEF Viewing position and finally rotated the MA (Main Arm)      Wrist Roll Joint to the EE Access position;</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Afterwards, JEMRMS systems      were switched to Standby and deactivated.</li> </ul> 
  Also in the JPM, Koichi continued his support of an ongoing micro-G assessment by tapping a portside seat track several times with his fist to provide intentional excitation to the MMA (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus) and SAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System).    [With the crew size doubled, TCQ (Temporary Crew Quarters) for Bob Thirsk were installed in the JPM at loc. JPM1F3, using CWC-I (Collapsible Water Container-Iodine) bags as radiation protection.  Since JAXA has plans to conduct micro-G sensitive science (such as the Marangoni Experiment) during crew sleep later in this Increment, micro-G data gathering is being conducted, using MMA &amp; SAMS simultaneously, to assess the impact on these experiments of crew motions.] 
 
  Barratt &amp; Padalka had their pre-EVA PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Mike at ~6:20am, Gennady at ~7:00am EDT.
 
  In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), it was Frank DeWinne’s turn to activate the EPM LPT (European Physiology/Module Laptop Terminal), installed NES (NeuroSpat) equipment, such as the MEEMM (Multi-Electrode Electroencephalogram Measurement Module) cables, free-floating &amp; low-frequency head box #1, EEG (Electroencephalograph) cap with electrodes, etc., took documentary photography of the EEG cap and then had ~70 min for performing his first NeuroSpat exercise session, assisted by Bob Thirsk who finished his NeuroSpat session yesterday successfully.  Afterwards, the gear was dismantled &amp; stowed, the software closed down and the laptop deactivated.    [The MEEMM is a subsection of the EPM facility and will be used for different types of non-invasive brain function investigations. It can also easily be reconfigured to support research in the field of muscle physiology. NeuroSpat, the first experiment to use the EPM, investigates the ways in which crew members’ three-dimensional visual &amp; space perception is affected by long-duration stays in weightlessness.]
 
  Later in the day, Frank finished the ongoing update of EPM LPT software by launching the concluding file transfer activity.
 
  Preparatory to the Russian Orlan EVA-22 &amp; EVA-23, Thirsk uninstalled a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop (#2209) in the COL and transferred it to the FGB to support the spacewalks.
 
  Also for tomorrow’s EVA-22, CDR Padalka retrieved three “Pille-MKS” radiation dosimeters, recording their dosages and equipping each of the two Orlan-MK suits (in pocket on left calf) with a sensor unit (A0309 &amp; A0310).    [A third &amp; fourth sensor, A0306 &amp; A0308, remain on duty for SM background readings on the Pille Reader tray].
 
  As protection during the spacewalk, the FE-1 closed the external shutters of the Lab window (where AgCam is mounted) and the FE-4 later also the JPM window shutters.
 
  FE-3 Romanenko set up the NIKON D2X camera equipment at the VL2 window of the “Pirs” Docking Compartment and took photographs of the MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) on the SA (Descent Module) and PAO (Propulsion Compartment) of the Soyuz TMA-15/19S spacecraft docked at the FGB nadir port, to support analysis of the MLI’s condition.
 
  Romanenko undertook his first session of the new Russian behavioral assessment MBI-20 TIPOLOGIA, setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.    [The CDR assisted him in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes, applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit and taking photographs.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
  Roman also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  In addition, working off the Russian discretionary task list, the FE-3 conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  Padalka &amp; Romanenko used a NIKON DX2 camera to take photographs of each other holding the Russian “Year of Youth” flag delivered on 19S.    [The photos will be shown on 6/12 in Moscow.]
   
  Continuing the extended leak integrity checking of the spare BZh Liquid Unit (#056) for the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator, Gennady charged the unit once again with pressurized N<sub>2</sub> from the BPA Nitrogen Purge Unit (#23) to 1 atm (1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>).  The last test pressurization test to monitor for leakage was on 5/12.    [Objective of the monthly checkout of the BZh, which has been in stowage for about 2 years, is to check for leakage and good water passage through the feed line inside of the BZh (from ZL1 connector to the buffer tank) and to check the response of the Electronics Unit’s micro switches (signaling “Buffer Tank is Empty” &amp; “Buffer Tank is Full”.  During Elektron operation, the inert gas locked up in the BZh has the purpose to prevent dangerous O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> mixing.  A leaking BZh cannot be used.]
 
  At ~3:30am EDT, Wakata and Thirsk joined in a tagup with the Japanese Flight Control Team at SSIPC/Tsukuba via S-band/audio.   [This conference is scheduled once every week, between the ISS crewmembers and SSIPC.]
 
  Three crewmembers not involved in the EVA-22 completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the ARED (FE-2, FE-4) and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5). 
 
  Later, Wakata transferred the exercise data file to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  Tonight after wake-up (~6:10pm) from the early sleep period, Bob &amp; Frank again will log SLEEP data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 laptop.
 
  Padalka &amp; Barratt will take the standard pre-EVA MO-9 “Urolux” urine biochemistry test before breakfast.   [A second session with the Urolux equipment will be conducted by both crewmembers tomorrow immediately after post-EVA station repress.]
 
  Thirsk will conduct the standard sensor calibration and check on the CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1043 &amp; #1059, delivered on Flight 1J, then take readings in the Lab.
 
  Other preparations leading up to the EVA-22 egress at ~2:45am will include –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">FE-3 Romanenko going      through a special “drill” to familiarize himself with closing      the hatch between the FGB PGO (Instrumentation Cargo Compartment) and the      SM, including air duct dismantling,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Checking the EVA cameras      by “test firing” them and transferred them to the DC1</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Checking out the Orlan-M      spacesuits and their systems, as well as the suit interface control panels      (BSS) in DC1 &amp; PkhO,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Opening the MPEV (Manual      Pressure Equalization Valve) in the Node 1’s overhead hatch to      prevent negative pressure on the hatch after the EVA,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Retesting the BK-3 primary      &amp; backup oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) tanks of the Orlans and DC1, </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Disassembling the DC1 air      duct, but leaving the V3 fan in place, </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Setting up the STTS      communications/telemetry links necessary for the spacewalk from the DC1,      including switching over the caution &amp; warning system from the regular      PSS console to the EVA support panel (POV).

 WRM Update:  A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked last night to the crew for their reference, updated with yesterday’s CWC (Collapsible Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (20-0055A) lists 46 CWCs (~1,285.8 L total) for the four types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (32 CWCs with 868.7 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 283.2 L currently off-limits because used as CWC-I from WPA, 409.3 L for flushing only due to Wautersia bacteria &amp; 176.2 L in 4 clean bags for contingency use, 2. potable water (8 CWCs with 349.6 L, of which 221.3 L (5 bags) are currently off-limit pending ground analysis results), the remainder good for contingency use 3. condensate water (3 CWCs, all empty), 4. waste/EMU dump and other (3 CWCs with 67.5 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 BRI Smart Switch Router Failure:   Yesterday, the Russian Smart Switch Router (BRI) failed to connect OpsLAN (Operations Local Area Network) to the SSCs (Station Support Computers) in the RS (Russian Segment) which prevented such info as radiograms, OCA messages and OSTPV (Onboard Short Term Plan Viewer) to be seen in the SM.  TsUP &amp; MCC-H set up alternate connectivity between RS and USOS (US Segment) via the WAP (Wireless Access Point; Russian: ABP) in the SM, which re-established good comm.  Meanwhile, the BRI is under investigation.
  
  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Irkutsk, Russia (Irkutsk is one of the CEO Capitals and City sites.  This city is one of the largest cities in Siberia and it lies at the Angara River.  Overlapping images were requested.  Looking slightly left of track for the city), Volga - Ural Delta, Russia (the Volga is the longest river in Europe; it drains much of Western Russia and empties into the Caspian Sea.  Since 1978 Caspian Sea level has risen over 2 meters, submerging valuable wetland habitats.  Shallow coastlines like the Volga delta are especially sensitive to sea level rise.  The crew was to take broad context views of the delta which should have appeared to the left of track.  CEO will use these kinds of images to document coastal changes), and Mount Vesuvius, Italy (looking directly below orbit track for this famous volcano, located between modern Naples and the ruins of ancient Pompeii.  Detailed imagery of the volcano's summit and flanks was requested for use with lower resolution satellite imagery).
 
  CEO photography can be studied at this “Gateway” website:
 <a href="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/" title="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/">http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov</a>  (as of 9/1/08, this database contained 770,668 views of the Earth from space, with 324,812 from the ISS alone).
