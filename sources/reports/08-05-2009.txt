ISS On-Orbit Status 08/05/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
  FE-5 Frank DeWinne started the next part (3<sup>rd</sup> of 5) of the periodic acoustic measurement protocol by recording post-sleep data of the crew-worn acoustic dosimeters, later deploying the dosimeters statically (Part 4), one at the SM (Service Module) Central Post, one in Node-2 and the third in an empty rack bay in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), away from air flow, taking photographs of the locations.  Afterwards (~5:10pm EDT), DeWinne will record the data taken by the three static dosimeters during the day (Part 5).   [Acoustic data must be taken twice per Increment, each time for the duration of the 16-hour crew workday.] 
 
  Before breakfast &amp; first exercise, DeWinne also took a full session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis.  Afterwards, the FE-5 closed out and stowed the Urolux hardware.     [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).]
 
  In the RS (Russian Segment), work continued on the SKV1 air conditioner which has been nonfunctional for a very long time.  Today, CDR Padalka &amp; FE-3 Romanenko had several hours set aside to drain the Khladon 218 (Freon) coolant from the SKV1 into a container.  The drain/vent was closed out afterwards.  [Next step will be the removal &amp; replacement of the heat exchanger.]
 
  In addition, Padalka &amp; Romanenko worked in the Soyuz 18S, performing a health check of the KhSA Cooler/Dehumidifier Assembly’s V1 fan in the DM (Descent Module) by toggling it and the V2 fan on/off and checking air flow.    [On 6/25, a planned replacement of the apparently faulty fan in the Soyuz 18S DM with a new unit proved to be not necessary after Padalka configured a jumper bypass which successfully recovered functionality of the air conditioner fan.  Today’s activity was to check up on the fix.] 
 
  FE-4 Thirsk conducted his third ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Exercise Echo session, using the TVIS or CEVIS as per his choice.  Frank DeWinne again assisted with equipment donning and some picture taking.   [The ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, with CCISS (Cardiovascular &amp; Cerebrovascular Control on Return from ISS) Baro Study, is scheduled tomorrow.]
 
  FE-2 Tim Kopra set up the photographic equipment for the moon photography required by the JAXA EPO (Educational Programs Operation) “ISS Moon Score” and afterwards conducted the shooting at pre-set times.    [The purpose of this JAXA EPO is to create a musical score using moon photos taken from the “Kibo” JEM and DC-1 windows at different times in the lunar cycle while the crew is floating naturally under microgravity environment.  Five of the seven sessions required for each different Moon age were taken by Greg Chamitoff and Koichi Wakata.]
 
  Bob Thirsk continued replenishing the Icepacs in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) by inserting two more +4C Icepac belts into MELFI.   [The Icepacs were originally removed as part of 2J/A packing.  Nine additional activities spaced at least 24 hours apart are being planned over the next two weeks, each time inserting two Icepac belts (to prevent temperature increase inside the MELFI.]
 
  After setting up the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) hardware and checking it out, Mike Barratt, Tim Kopra, Bob Thirsk and Frank DeWinne in turn used it for BMM (Body Mass Measurement).  It was Mike’s 5<sup>th</sup> time, Bob’s &amp; Frank’s second time &amp; Tim’s first time.  Later, the hardware was stowed.    [SLAMMD, performed first on Expedition 12 in December 2005, provides an accurate means of determining the on-orbit mass of humans spanning the range from the 5th percentile Japanese female and the 95th percentile American male.  The procedure, in accordance with Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law of Motion, finds the mass by dividing force, generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer, by acceleration measured with a precise optical instrument that detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing.  The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.  To calculate their mass, crewmembers wrap their legs around a leg support assembly, align the stomach against a belly pad and either rest the head or chin on a head rest.  For calibration, an 18-lbs. mass is used at different lengths from the pivot point, to simulate different mass values.  Crew mass range is from 90 to 240 lbs.]
 
  FE-1 Barratt continued R12 software transition on the PCS (Portable Computer System) laptops in the ISS after the C&amp;C (Command &amp; Control) transition to CCS (Command &amp; Control Software) R8 and connecting Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) and A/L (Airlock) laptops.    [The transition consisted of swapping pre-deployed PCS R12 HDDs (hard disk drives) into the SM (Service Module), Lab RWS, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) laptops and stowing the older R11 HDDs.  All laptops were to be powered on when complete so they can be patched overnight from the ground.] 
 
  Mike, Tim &amp; Frank each conducted a session with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows) by logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and performing the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.  It was Mike’s 5<sup>th</sup>, Tim’s 2<sup>nd</sup>, Frank’s 3<sup>rd</sup> session.     [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
  Tim Kopra conducted the periodic status &amp; screen check on the payload CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus), located in the ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2),
 
  The FE-2 also started (later terminated) another 5-hr automatic sampling run, the 20<sup>th</sup>, with the new EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer), also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-4 (Station Support Computer 4) laptop.   [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  Today’s data will again to be compared with VOA and GSC (Grab Sample Container) measurements.  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS hardware.]
 
  Roman Romanenko performed a number of RS service &amp; maintenance tasks, including –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Configuring the pumping      equipment and starting the transfer of fresh water from Progress 34P cargo      ship to the SM Rodnik BV2 tank, monitoring the transfer several times      during the day [SM Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 each contain ~210 L of      potable water.  In addition, EDV containers (~22L each) are used (and      identified) for a number of purposes, e.g., EDV-U for storing urine, EDV      w/disinfectant for flushing Rodnik plumbing, EDV at RP (flow regulator)      with potable water, EDV-SV  for potable water at SVO-ZV, EDV-KOV for      the Elektron apparatus, from US CWC.],</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Using the CMS (Countermeasure      System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for Vinyl      Chloride and Ethanol in the SM  [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips      to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol,      C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde,      Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur dioxide, Hydrogen      cyanide, Phosgene, etc.],</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Afterwards      pre-packing the lifetime-expired Russian AOK GANK-4M Real-Time Harmful      Contaminant Gas Analyzer equipment for disposal,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Conducting the periodic inspection      of the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor’s sediment trap insert [the      Russian SRVK-2M converts collected condensate into drinking water and      dispenses the reclaimed potable water], and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;text-autospace:none">Relocating three IPK-1M gas masks      from FGB stowage to Soyuz 18S plus another three gas masks from SM stowage      to Soyuz 19S, stowing them in each case behind the BNP Portable Air      Repress Bottle.</li> </ul> 
  Romanenko also conducted his fourth data collection for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (Interactions) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.    [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.] 
 
  In the US A/L, Kopra terminated the regeneration process on two METOX (Metal Oxide) CO<sub>2</sub> absorption canisters (#0007 &amp; #0011) from the last EVAs and initiated it on two other used canisters (#0019 &amp; 0020) in the “bakeout” oven. 
 
  In the Lab, DeWinne performed the regular controlled shut-down of the EHS VOA (Environmental Health System-Volatile Organic Analyzer), with the ground power-cycling its RPC-3 (Remote Power Controller 3), part of RPCM (RPC Module) LAD42B_A.
 
  Frank also retrieved EXPRESS IBM 760XD laptop 3GB hard drives and stowed them with SAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System) spare parts.
 
  FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE-5 joined in prepacking &amp; staging cargo for return on STS-128/17A later this month.
 
  CDR &amp; FE-3 meanwhile continued transferring newly arrived cargo from Progress 34P to the ISS, logging moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System).
 
  Roman did the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  Gennady completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Tim Kopra had another hour to himself for general orientation (station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-1), ARED (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-3). 
  
  Later, Mike transferred the exercise data files to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
 New Software Load (On-Orbit X2-R8, PCS R12 &amp; MSS R6.2).    The first two days of the X2-R8 software transition have gone very smoothly.  Today, after a recovery of the JCP computer in the Kibo module, the ground performed a Primary C&amp;C Transition to bring CCS R8 into Primary.  After the transition, the crew was given the GO from MCC-H to connect the R12 PCSs at the Cupola RWS and then in the AL.  Following this they then swapped the prepositioned R12 HDs into the remaining PCS laptops (see above) and powered them all on so they can be patched overnight from the ground.
 
 ATA Isolation Test:   Yesterday, the ground completed a P1 ATA (Ammonia Tank Assembly) Isolation test yesterday which kept the ETCS (External Thermal Control System) Loop B isolated from its ammonia tanks for over 4 days (111 hrs).  All parameters remained within expected ranges while isolated from its tanks.  This information, which will be used to validate engineering models, has increased confidence that the ETCS can operate nominally in support of the ATA R&amp;Rs during 17A(P1) and 19A(S1).
