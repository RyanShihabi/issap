ISS On-Orbit Status 03/29/09
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Crew day: Wake 6:30am EDT; sleep 5:30pm (until 2:00am tomorrow morning).  Day 2 of joint E18/19 operations.  Sunday – light-duty handover day for the ISS crew CDR Fincke, CDR-19 Padalka, FE-1 Lonchakov, FE-1-19 Barratt, FE-2 Wakata, and SFP Simonyi. Ahead: Week 23 of Increment 18 (last).
 
 Koichi Wakata started out in the morning with the fourth day of his first week-long session of the SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) experiment, using payload software for data downloading and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s session file on the HRF-1 laptop.    [To monitor the crewmember’s sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, Koichi wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him as well as his patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days, as part of the crew’s discretionary “job jar” task list.] 
 
 Mike Fincke broke out the equipment for the CCIS experiment and performed Day 1 of his second on-orbit session with the CCISS (Cardiovascular &amp; Cerebrovascular Control on Return from ISS) experiment by setting up and donning the Holter Monitor, donning the CBPD (Continuous Blood Pressure Device), performing the Baro Study, doffing the CBPD, and starting the 24-hr passive heart rate data collection.   [Data are recorded on a PCMCIA memory card, with the HRF (Human Research Facility) rack laptop for control.  Data download and equipment stowage is scheduled tomorrow after the 24-hr period.  Former Flight Surgeon Mike Barratt assisted as Operator, placing electrodes and donning the CBPD, and took documentary photography.  CCISS studies the effects of long-duration spaceflight on crewmembers' heart functions and their blood vessels that supply the brain (= “cerebrovascular”).  Learning more about the changes in cardiovascular &amp; cerebrovascular systems in zero-G could lead to specific countermeasures that might better protect future space travelers.  For the Baro study of CCIS, heart rate and blood pressure are being recorded for resting and timed breathing for 5 min, with no caffeine or food (water is acceptable) allowed two hours before the start of the Baro Study and no exercise prior to the Baro Study.]
 
 Afterwards, Fincke &amp; Barratt spent about an hour on handover activities, getting the new FE-1 ready for Increment 19.
 
 Yuri Lonchakov meanwhile set up the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, including the NIKON D2X camera for Padalka to take documentary imagery, and conducted the session, his fourth, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop, equipped with new software, and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data stowed in the Soyuz TMA-13 spacecraft for return to the ground.     [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.] 
 
 Afterwards, the FE-1 closed out the Matryoshka-R (RBO-3-2) radiation payload which he had deactivated &amp; disassembled on 3/18, and prepacked Kit #7 for return on Soyuz 17S, after taking digital images of the AST spectrometer and the three RBO-3-2 kits in the SM (Service Module).
 
 Working with Padalka, Lonchakov also took photography of the payloads –
 <ul><li>BTKh-14 BIOEMULSION (insertion of Bioreactor in CRYOGEM-03),  <li>BTKh-10 CONJUGATION (RECOMB-K activity),  <li>BTKh-26 KASKAD (deactivation &amp; stowage), and  <li>TEKh-15 DAKON IZGIB (Bend) hardware (closeout activity). 
 </li></li></li></li></ul>In addition, the FE-1 and CDR-19 set up the power packs for the BAR instruments “Kelvin-Video” and TTM-2 for charging for another operational run of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload.  Charging will be terminated tomorrow (3/30), and data taking will be continued in a second session.   [Objective of EXPERT is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  The payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A) and a heat-loss anemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.] 
 
 Mike Fincke performed the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways, including the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Compartment)–PrK–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, FGB PGO–FGB GA, FGB GA–Node-1.    [This checkup is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently six persons, and one of the two Russian SKV air conditioners off (SKV-1) because it is beyond its service life.]
 
 Floating in the Habitation Module of the newly arrived Soyuz TMA-14/18S spacecraft, Gennady and Yuri installed the LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry system and its ROM/read-only memory unit (PZU TA765B), both kept in storage from an earlier Soyuz.
 
 Padalka &amp; Lonchakov also had an hour reserved for replacing and updating RODF (Russian Operations Data File) procedures pages that arrived with 18S, updating five books (VC-16 Emergency, Biotechnical Experiments, Medical Experiments, Biological Experiments, LDM (Long-Duration Missions), and stowing two new ODF CD-ROMs plus two new books (VC-16 Program, E18/19 Crew Handover).
 
 In the SM, Yuri completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Gennady meanwhile performed the regular daily job of IMS (Inventory Management System) “delta file” updating/editing for the weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 FE-2 Wakata set up the NUTRITION w/Repository hardware for his first session, starting tomorrow with the blood draw.   [The 24-hr urine collection starts with the first void of the day tomorrow morning (with Fincke assisting) and continues through the first void on Tuesday (3/31) morning.  Col. Mike’s FD180 NUTRITION collection is also scheduled next week, starting on 3/31.]
 
 Col. Mike, Dr. Mike &amp; Wakata-san worked on the CEVIS cycle ergometer, installing the new control panel (-320) which was delivered on STS-119/15A.    [The new panel, which should restore the CEVIS to nominal operations, allowing data to be stored on the crewmember’s PCMCIA memory cards, differs from the old panel in that it is Windows based.  After installation of the panel and display cable, the crew performed an Activation &amp; Checkout protocol to verify that the control panel is properly commanding the Ergometer in all three modes of operation.] 
 
 Having secured the DomeGene samples in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) yesterday before Soyuz hatch opening, FE-2 Wakata today worked in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) on the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) in the Saibo Rack, turning off and removing the ELT (Experiment Laptop), removing EUs (Experiment Units), rotating the CBEF fan to its startable position and configuring the CB (Clean Bench) for stowage. Koichi also took documentary photography with the D2Xs camera.
 
 Later today, the CDR &amp; FE-2 will have their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Col. Mike at ~1:45pm EDT, Koichi at ~3:33pm.
 
 Simonyi, Lonchakov, Padalka &amp; Barratt were scheduled for their first PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Charles at ~9:30am, Yuri at ~12:20pm, Gennady at ~1:10pm, Dr. Mike at ~2:25pm.
 
 Scheduled VC-16 activities for SFP Charles Simonyi today included –
 <ul><li>Reading accumulated data from one of the “Pille-MKS” radiation sensors,  <li>Conducting the daily comm session with his advisory team at TsUP/Moscow,  <li>Working with his email,  <li>Conducting his IP-Phone call to the ground, and  <li>Performing Earth photography plus copying the pictures to his HDD (Hard Disk Drive) for return. 
 </li></li></li></li></li></ul>Fincke, Wakata &amp; Lonchakov completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-2), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1), and ARED resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2).
