ISS On-Orbit Status 08/24/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Progress M-12M/44P launched nominally this morning at 9:00am EDT at Baikonur/Kazakhstan on a three-stage Soyuz-U.  At about 325 sec into the flight, i.e., just after third-stage ignition, propulsion shut down, and the stage coasted.  Instead of reaching orbit, stage+Progress 44P impacted in Siberia (Altai region) of the Russian Federation.  The supply ship carried a cargo of 2,660 kg, including 1260 kg of dry cargo (maintenance hardware, resupply items, life support system items, experiment equipment), 930 kg propellants, 50 kg oxygen (gaseous), and 420 kg water.</li></ul>The flight manifest lists 257 cargo items for delivery to the ISS, including 161 Russian items (143 logistics cargo items, including Russian FCE for US crew [15 items] and Russian ECLSS equipment [20 items]), 18 cargo items for 13 experiments [Tipologiya, Poligen, Matryoshka-R, Kaskad, Konyugatsiya, BIF, Aril, Membrana, Aseptik, Vynoslivost, Test, OChB, and Plazmennyi Kristall-3 Plus]), and 86 International Partner's cargo items (71 NASA logistics cargo items, including limited-life and consumable items for USOS systems and provisions for Russian and US crewmembers [of these, 24 items belong to transit cargo, and 47 items may have been used on the ISS RS (Russian Segment)], 14 cargo items for 6 US experiments for conducting on the USOS, and one cargo item for a European experiment to be conducted on the USOS).  The most critical loss was a number of Russian laptops loaded with new software (Vers. 8.05).
 
As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, CDR Borisenko performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as well as the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated later today (~4:50pm EDT), followed tomorrow by Bed #2 regeneration.      [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.]
 
After donning their Sokol flight suits, Borisenko, Samokutyayev &amp; Garan, due to return on 9/8, conducted the periodic 20-min. fit check of their Kazbek couches, the three contoured shock absorbing seats in the Soyuz TMA-21/26S spacecraft’s SA Descent Module.      [For the fit check, crewmembers remove their flightsuit cabin apparel and don Sokol KV-2 suit &amp; comm caps, get into in their seats and assess the degree of comfort and uniform body support provided by the seat liner.  Using a ruler, they then measure the gap between the top of the head and the top edge of the structure facing the head crown.  The results are reported to TsUP.  Kazbek-UM couches are designed to withstand g-loads during launch and orbital insertion as well as during reentry and brake-rocket-assisted landing.  Each seat has two positions: cocked (armed) and noncocked. In cocked position, they are raised to allow the shock absorbers to function during touchdown.  The fit check assures that the crewmembers, whose bodies gain in length during longer-term stay in zero-G, will still be adequately protected by the seat liners for their touchdown in Kazakhstan, either emergency or regular return.]
 
After checking out proper communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, Andrey downloaded the science &amp; service data accumulated from the GFI-7 Molniya-GAMMA experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28.       [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.]
 
In the US Airlock, FE-6 Fossum inspected EMU SCU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit / Service &amp; Cooling Umbilical) #1005 to verify that its O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) poppet is secure and torqued to specification.
 
After activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), Fossum disassembled the SHERE (Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment) payload hardware and stowed it.  He also removed the entire SHERE FM (Fluid Module) stowage tray the CGBA (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus) for final stowage.  The MSG was then turned off.     [Background:  Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of an applied stress (“preshearing” = rotation) which might be, for example, a shear stress or extensional stress.  In practice, rheology is principally concerned with extending the "classical" disciplines of elasticity and (Newtonian) fluid mechanics to materials whose mechanical behavior cannot be described with the classical theories.  SHERE is designed to study the effect of preshear (rotation) on the transient evolution of the microstructure and viscoelastic tensile stresses for solutions with long chains of monodisperse dilute polymer molecules in the MSG.  Collectively referred to as “Boger fluids,” these polymer solutions have become a popular choice for rheological studies of non-Newtonian fluids and are the non-Newtonian fluid used in this experiment.  The SHERE hardware consists of the Rheometer, Camera Arm, Interface Box, Cabling, Keyboard, Tool Box, Fluid Modules, and Stowage Tray.]
 
Afterwards, FE-6 spent several hours on MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3), drying &amp; cleaning its Dewars 2, 3 &amp; 4 and interior trays.     [Dewar 1 was dried &amp; cleaned on 8/22.]
 
Ron Garan, Satoshi Furukawa &amp; Mike Fossum each completed their 3<sup>rd</sup> sessions with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.        [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
CDR Borisenko &amp; FE-4 Volkov, as a handover, did the daily routine inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, checking for proper fan operation by testing the air flow from the ventilators BO A04 &amp; BO A05 and verifying that both LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are lit and then watering the root modules KM A32 &amp; A24 to the roper humidity level.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] 
 
Aleksandr Samokutyayev conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Sasha also took on the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
FE-5 opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Satoshi will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
Furukawa conducted periodic water sampling activities including –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">The periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose,  [after the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">“Week 23” water sample collecting in Node-3 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient &amp; Hot ports for inflight &amp; post-flight analysis,   [from Ambient: 1 post-flight sample (500 mL) &amp; 1 iodine in-flight sample (75 mL); from Hot: 1 post-flight sample (500 mL), 1 TOCA in-flight sample (250 mL), and 1 microbiology in-flight sample (125 mL).  The in-flight samples were subsequently processed in the MCD (microbial capture device) and CDB (coliform detection bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection.  After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">“Week 23” water sampling from the WRS potable water in the SM for chemical &amp; microbial analysis, using a specific water sample collection packet from stowage,   [collected were one 500 mL post-flight sample from the SVO-ZV port and one 500 mL post-flight sample from the SRV-K Hot port for return on 26S].</li></ul>Samokutyayev filled two EDV containers with water, one (EDV-SV #946) with US condensate from CWC (Contingency Water Container) #1098, the other EDV #945, on RP flow regulator, with water from Progress 42P’s water tank 2 (which contained ~210 L), using Kompressor–M (#41), an A-R hose and an adapter.
 
In early preparation for their return to gravity on 9/8, Borisenko &amp; Samokutyayev underwent their first preliminary Chibis ODNT exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the T2 treadmill, taking turns as subject and CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  For their 55-min exercise, monitored from the ground via telemetry (6:08am &amp; 7:44am EDT), Andrey &amp; Sasha wore the GAMMA-1 system and the REG ShKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap.      [ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system after his long-term stay in zero-G.  The preparatory training consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -20, -25, -30, -35 mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
The three Russian crewmembers also had ~30 min set aside for reviewing the biotechnical experiments which Progress M-12M/45P was to deliver on 8/26.  Andrey later activated the TBU (Universal Bioengineering Thermostat) and KRIOGEM-3 thermostatic containers for the payloads.  These 13 experiments (Tipologiya, Poligen, Matryoshka-R, Kaskad, Konyugatsiya, BIF, Aril, Membrana, Aseptik, Vynoslivost, Test, OChB, and Plazmennyi Kristall-3 Plus) were all lost with the cargo ship.
 
In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-5 Furukawa set up the medical laptop and 
connected with a medical doctor at SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center) in introducing the ODK (Onboard Diagnostic Kit) by performing a simulation of a remote medical check out of ISS crew.     [After today’s rehearsal, including configuration check, and the first conference (Demo 1), an open press session is scheduled on 9/6 (Demo 2).]
 
Afterwards, Furukawa completed the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their Lab ERs (EXPRESS Racks).
 
Satoshi also powered on the USND-2 (Ultrasound 2) and transferred data from ICV session performed on 8/23 from the USND-2 hard drive to the USND-2 USB drive.  FE-5 then turned off the hardware, decabled the VPC (Video Power Converter) from HRF Rack 1, and stowed the hardware.     [Yesterday’s attempt at data transfer was unsuccessful, probably due to a loose cable connection.]
 
Ron Garan undertook the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics.  At the end, FE-3 completed a self-assessment questionnaire.  Answers were then provided at test conclusion.     [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.]
 
Garan also collected air samples with the GSC (Grab Sample Container) in the SM, Lab and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), using three regular samplers.     [GSC #2072 – SM; GSC #2071 – Lab; GSC #2073 – COL.]
 
Later, Ron set up the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware including MBS (Mixing Bag System) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for his 3<sup>rd</sup> VO<sub>2</sub>max session tomorrow.     [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.]
 
Furukawa &amp; Garan conducted the 7<sup>th</sup> onboard JAXA HAIR experiment, with Satoshi collecting hair samples of Ron (his first), then inserting them into MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), Dewar 1/Tray A at -95 degC and closing out the activity.
 
In preparation for the arrival of Progress 45P, Furukawa &amp; Volkov set up the (now no longer required) Ku-band video “scheme” for a communications test of converting the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band from FGB &amp; SM, for downlinking “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.
 
Borisenko supported the ground-commanded reactivation of the Elektron-VM O<sub>2</sub> generator, first performing the usual buffer volume compression, then monitoring the external temperature of its BD secondary purification unit for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.      [The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause dangerous overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]
 
Continuing the current round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Andrey spent ~40 min in the DC1 Docking Compartment cleaning the VD1 &amp; VD2 air ducts.
 
Afterwards, the CDR completed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, DC1–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
Garan had an hour each set aside for personal crew departure preparations; these are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
FE-3 also deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.      [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
With its battery recharged overnight, Sergei Volkov set up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM window #2 for another sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with the coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloaded the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.  The equipment was then torn down and stowed away.      [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere],
 
Samokutyayev &amp; Borisenko continued loading the Descent Module of Soyuz TMA-21/26S (#231, docked at MRM2), with cargo slated for return to Earth, based on an uplinked itemized stowage list.
 
Sasha &amp; Andrey also used another hour for handover activities with FE-4 Volkov, passing RS responsibilities to Sergei.
 
Volkov again had time reserved for shooting more “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7 #2 high-definition camcorder as part of the ongoing effort to create a photo &amp; video documentary database on the flight of ISS-28 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.      [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz &amp; Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.]
 
FE-3, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Ron at ~12:00pm, Mike at ~12:45pm, Satoshi at ~1:35pm EDT.
 
At ~5:00am EDT, Satoshi held a teleconference with SSIPC management, and at ~7:15am the regular weekly crew conference with SSIPC staff.
 
Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron turns on the MPC and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC was to be turned off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-1, FE-5).  No exercise reported for FE-3.  FE-6 recorded video of his ARED workout.
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Dushanbe, Tajikistan (this capital city with a population nearing 750,000 is located in an agricultural area of the western part of the country at the confluence of the Varzob and Kofarnihon Rivers.  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass in clear weather over this target.  Looking nadir for the city as ISS tracked northeastward towards high ranges of Tajikistan), Amman, Jordan (the Jordanian capital of about 2 million sprawls over a high, desert plateau just northeast of the Dead Sea.  On this clear-weather, mid-afternoon pass, the crew was to look nadir for this target immediately after noting the sea), Major Hurricane Irene (DYNAMIC EVENT:   Hurricane Irene is expected to become a major [Category 3] storm by the time of this mid-afternoon pass to the SE.  At this time as ISS tracked northeastward over the island of Hispaniola, the crew was to look well left of track for views of Irene.  Short lens views probably worked best for context views, but if a well-defined eye was visible long lens views may have been appropriate), and Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (this LTER [Long-Term Ecological Research] study area is a barrier island and marsh complex located on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island and the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the United States.  ISS had a mid-afternoon, nadir pass in fair weather that should be ideal for a detailed mapping strip from Brunswick to Savannah as it tracked northeastward along the coast).
