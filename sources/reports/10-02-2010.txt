ISS On-Orbit Status 10/02/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – crew rest day.
 
  At wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  CDR Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 5<sup>th</sup> for both of them, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Walker completed Day 3 of her current 4-day session on the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 4<sup>th</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
  Wheelock had Day 2 of his new Pro K session, his 4<sup>th</sup> on board.
 
  As part of the crew’s regular morning inspection tour, Fyodor Yurchikhin conducted the routine checkup of circuit breakers &amp; fuses in the DC-1 Docking Compartment.     [The monthly checkup in the “Pirs” module looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.]
 
  The three station residents completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays but pulled forward a day because of the pending Progress arrival, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  Fyodor completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  After setting up the KODAK DSC 760 video cameras for two standard definition views and the G1 camcorder for one HD (High Definition) view, Doug Wheelock &amp; Shannon Walker each took the refurbished T2/COLBERT treadmill in Node-3 through a manned AOC (Activation &amp; Checkout) session.     [The runs had been approved by ground engineers after yesterday’s unmanned ACO.] 
 
  Wheels filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  Before her sleeptime, Shannon sets up the equipment for her next 24-hour urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol, starting tomorrow.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood &amp; urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
  At ~9:25am EDT, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR/ACO, FE-6/ACO).
 
  Jobs listed for Fyodor on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list today were –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another ~30-min. run of      the GFI-8      "Uragan"      (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the FSS      hardware for simultaneous spectrometry of the Strelets Steppe Preserve in      the vicinity of the City of Kursk and the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant,      taking track imagery of the Kursk target area to the Strelets Preserve  [the      FSS      system consists of an image recording module with lens and a      spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  The orbital      imagery is supported by a field team on the ground in the Preserve till      10/4.  For today’s session, Fyodor last night charged and      checked the ME/Electronics Module &amp; MRI/Image Recording Module      batteries and also set up the FSS      science hardware near window #9.] and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for      Russia's EKON      Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography      of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.</li> </ul>
