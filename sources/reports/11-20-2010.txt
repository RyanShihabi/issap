ISS On-Orbit Status 11/20/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday --- Crew rest day.
 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Today 12 years ago (1958), the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok) “Zarya”, of Almaz legacy, was launched on a Proton rocket at Baikonur, becoming the first element of the ISS.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
 At day’s begin, FE-1 Kaleri conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Alex will again inspect the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-6 Walker continued her current 4-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 5<sup>th</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  Before sleeptime tonight, Shannon also set up the equipment for her last (FD180) NUTRITION/Repository/Pro K 24-hr urine collections starting tomorrow.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 Wheelock, Kaleri, Skripochka, Kelly &amp; Walker completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
 At ~9:00am EST, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
 FE-1 Kaleri performed another STTS comm test over the currently active backup string on VHF1 &amp; 2 over RGS (Russian Groundsite) from the SM (Service Module) at ~3:08am-3:34am EST.
 
 Afterwards, Alex had ~30 min for the standard Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) onboard familiarization training, his first, using a NIKON D2Xs digital still camera with 400mm &amp; 800mm lenses and taking practice shots of CEO (Crew Earth Observation) ground features from SM windows #6 or #8, with images having 40-50% overlap and about 20 images in each sequence.  Afterwards, Sasha transferred the shots to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for subsequent downlink for ground analysis.     [The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the next Shuttle (STS-133/Discovery/ULF5), to be launched NET 11/30.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Discovery, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
 Kelly configured the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) for using the internal EDV-U container, and reported the flush counter.
 
 With video monitoring of his activity via MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), Scott also transferred all CFE (Capillary Flow Experiment) tapes from the “Return to Houston” bag to the CFE CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag).     [The tapes no longer need to be returned to the ground since the CFE PD (Payload Developer) has determined that the quality of the high definition downlink is in general acceptable for their scientific analysis.]
 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin had another ~90 min to continue the stowage process on Soyuz 23S, arranging return cargo in the SA Descent Module (spuskayemyy apparat) for transfer to a representative at the landing site, and trash &amp; other discarded stuff in the BO Orbital Module.
 
 Fyodor also spent ~2h in the MRM1 “Rassvet” module, inspecting and cleaning the MGK cover sealing mechanism of the hatch between MRM1 &amp; Soyuz 23S.     [After removing the protective covers with its fasteners, Fyodor performed a visual and photographic inspection of the MGK mechanism, its internal gear and the entire MGK.  With new filters installed in the vacuum cleaner, the system was then cleaned and the MGK drive cover re-installed nominally.] 
 
 FE-6 Walker performed the periodic camera setup status check on the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) with Sample 8 (done at Days 1, 3 &amp; 5 after initialization).
 
 Shannon &amp; Wheels filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 At ~6:50am, Oleg Skripochka, Fyodor Yurchikhin &amp; Alex Kaleri supported a Russian PAO TV interview exchange for the NAUKA 2.0 science documentary project by Yedinaya Media Gruppa TV Studios.    [The project’s features will be broadcast on Rossiya 2, Rossiya 24 &amp; Moya Planeta channels. With documentaries such as ‘Space. One Step To The Launch’, ‘Evolution of a Space Suit’, ‘A Launchpad In French Guyana’ already being familiar to the TV viewers, the production team is now in the middle of shooting of a new feature on space food and meals arrangement.]
 
 Doug Wheelock had two PFCs (Private Family Conferences), at ~1:15pm &amp; 2:50pm, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3), and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
