All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday – off-duty day for CDR Fincke, FE-1 Lonchakov &amp; FE-2 Magnus.    Ahead: Week 11 of Increment 18.
 
 Sandy Magnus conducted the T+2d inflight microbiology analyses for the samples collected on 1/2 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient plus SVO-ZV and SRV-K Warm taps, using the MCD (Microbial Capture Device) and CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for visual analysis and data recording.
 
 CDR Fincke meanwhile completed the T+5 day visual analysis &amp; data recording of air and surface samples with the surface slides an d Petri dishes of the MAS (Microbial Air Sampling) &amp; SSK (Surface Sample Kit) collected on 12/30.
 In the SM (Service Module), FE-1 Lonchakov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the Service Module (SM), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow. Additionally, the FE-1 today checked up on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM's SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP-Moscow.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and performing US condensate processing (transfer from CWC to EDV containers) if condensate is available.]
 
 For troubleshooting the Russian RSK-1 laptop, the FE-1 had ~90 min set aside at 9:00am EST, supported by ground specialist tagup.
 
 The FE-1 also had a number of discretionary tasks on his “time permitting” job list for today –
Conducting the frequent status check on the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-1 ("Plants-1") experiment, verifying proper operation of the BU Control Unit and MIS-LADA Module fans (testing their air flow by hand).  [Rasteniya-1 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-14 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)], 
Running a session of the DZZ-2 "Diatomeya" ocean observations program, using an HDV camcorder for nocturnal observations of the ocean to detect and record bio-luminescent glows in high production water areas, and  
Another ECON KPT-3 session, making observations and taking aerial photography for Russia's Environmental Safety Agency (ECON) using the D2X with SIGMA 300-800mm telephoto lens. 

 The station residents conducted their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-2, FE-1), RED resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2) and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
 
 The crew also have their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Yuri at 6:00am, Sandy at 12:30pm, Mike at 2:30pm EST.
