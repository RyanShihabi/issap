Light Microscopy Module (LMM) Configuration: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy completed the LMM reconfiguration for the next use of the Fluids and Combustion Facility (FCF) for the Advanced Colloids Experiment (ACE) payload. Cassidy bent a pin on the microscope to reduce the clearance issues in the Z-axis, installed the LMM X-Y Stage, LMM objective lenses, Preliminary Advanced Colloids Experiment (PACE) Light Emitting Diode (LED) Base, ACE Sample, and Constrained Vapor Bubble (CVB) Surveillance Camera inside the LMM AFC (Auxiliary Fluids Container). Following ground checkout of the microscope configuration the crew will install the ACE sample on Tuesday.
ISS Emergency On-Board Training (OBT): The entire Expedition 36 crew as well as Mission Control Center (MCC)-Houston and MCC-Moscow performed an Emergency OBT. The scenario was based on a simulated rapid depress event. The ground teams subsequently debriefed the Emergency OBT with the Crew.
51 Progress (P) Hatch Closure and Leak Checks: CDR Vinogradov and FE-4 Yurchikhin removed the clamps then closed the hatches between 51P and SM Aft. They also performed vestibule and hatch leak checks. These activities were in preparation for undock scheduled for tomorrow at 8:59 a.m. CDT.
Russian GPS Receiver [ACH-M] Failure: Ground controllers received a notification that SM [ACH-M] Navigation Receiver Module-3 [НПМ-3] failed and was confirmed by Russian specialists. Only one НПМ is needed for docking Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)-4, however for redundancy and to ensure that at least one НПМ is available, two working units are required per the Flight Rule. On May 21, НПМ-4 was reported failed. The crew recabled the system such that НПМ-1 and НПМ-3 were available for use for ATV4 docking, scheduled for Saturday, June 15. Russian specialists and designers are working on troubleshooting steps and developing forward plans.
