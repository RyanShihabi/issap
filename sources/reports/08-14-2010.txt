ISS On-Orbit Status 08/14/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – crew off duty.   Happy Birthday, Tracy!
 
  At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  The three Russian station residents completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home.     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the uborka house cleaning, the crewmembers conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  Fyodor Yurchikhin also performed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems (UOV) in the SM &amp; FGB, cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson conducted the routine maintenance on the prime CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) unit (#1058), first replacing the battery, then zero-calibrating the instrument.    [The CSA-CP is a passive cabin atmosphere monitor that provides quick response capability during a combustion event (fire). Its collected data are stored on a logger. Following zero calibration, the prime unit was re-deployed at the SM Central Post.]
 
  Caldwell-Dyson, Wheelock &amp; Walker later joined up for a ~2-hr procedures review for the next contingency spacewalk, EVA-17, on Monday (8/16).
 
  After FE-2 terminated the regeneration of METOX (Metal Oxide) canisters #16 &amp; #19 in the A/L (Airlock) bake-out oven and restowed them in a bag (#1038), Tracy &amp; Doug installed METOX cans #22 &amp; #21 plus EMU batteries #2087 &amp; #2086 in their EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units), 3005 (EV1) &amp; 3009 (EV2), resp.  Tracy then also installed REBAs (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assemblies) #1008 &amp; #1012 in the spacesuits.
 
  A teleconference by Doug, Shannon &amp; Tracy with EVA specialists at MCC-Houston wrapped up preps at ~12:10pm.
 
  FE-6 Walker completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router, FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) and ISS FS laptops (required to mitigate the problem of iPV and OSTPV not opening up procedures due to a memory leak in the “Tomcat” software).  After a period of no less than 10 min later, Shannon also rebooted the two ISS network servers (SERVER1 &amp; 2).
 
  Walker filled out her weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  In preparation for EVA-17, Shannon charged the two batteries for the EVA D2Xs cameras.  About 3 hrs later, she configured the cameras for the spacewalk.
 
  At ~6:10am EDT, the Russian crewmembers downlinked a Telebridge TV message showing crewmembers exercising in orbit, on the occasion of today’s Day of the Athlete in Russia.     [The history of the oldest sports festival began on August 16, 1939, when the decision of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR established the Union Athlete’s Day.  During these years, physical education and sport that engulfed the country, resulted in the creation of numerous voluntary sports and sports societies, the adoption of the All-Union Physical Culture Complex "Ready for Labor and Defense of the USSR”, the development of the powerful “spartakiadnogo” movement which created a unique system of physical education of citizens.  Today’s downlink went to leaders of the Ministry of Sport, Tourism &amp; Youth Policy of the Russian Federation, pupils junior sports school of Olympic reserve, and representatives of the media.]
 
  Wheels completed the periodic inspection of the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), particularly its four isolators for their condition.      [“Corner 'A' Isolation Mount:  10 of 12 cables are attached, with 2 cables noticeably frayed; on the other side of the mount, adjacent to the CEVIS frame, there are 12 of 12 cables attached, with 1 cable frayed.  In corner 'A', 2 of the 12 cables are broken, and the ends taped.  Corner 'B' Isolation Mount:  On the side adjacent to the rack mount, there are 11 of 12 cables attached, with 3 cables frayed; on the other side of the mount, adjacent to the CEVIS frame, there are 12 of 12 cables attached, with 1 cable frayed.  In corner 'B', 1 of the 12 cables are broken, and the end taped.  Corner 'C' Isolation Mount:  On the side adjacent to the rack mount, there are 10 of 12 cables attached, with no cables noticeably frayed; on the other side of the mount, adjacent to the CEVIS frame, there are 12 of 12 cables attached, with 1 cable frayed.  In corner 'C', 2 of the 12 cables are broken, and the ends taped.  Corner 'D' Isolation Mount: On the side adjacent to the rack mount, there are 10 of 12 cables attached, with 2 cables frayed; on the other side of the mount, adjacent to the CEVIS frame, there are 12 of 12 cables attached, with 1 cable frayed.  In corner 'D', 2 of the 12 cables are broken, and the ends taped.  Photos were of all of the frayed cables and stored on SSC-15.”]
 
  FE-4 also performed the periodic maintenance &amp; visual inspection of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), checking out VIS (Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization) rails &amp; rollers, and greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails &amp; rollers.
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3, FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
  At ~10:30am, Alex, Mikhail &amp; Fyodor also engaged in a PAO phone interview via S-band with Ekaterina Beloglazova, Editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos Magazine and an old friend of ISS cosmonauts.     [“Mikhail, Fyodor, our last conference took place before your space walk.  Please, tell us about your impressions.”; “You can see everything from above.  What damage did fire cause to forestry?”;  “Now the smog almost dissipated, there are fewer fires; how many fires are still burning and in what regions?  How does this anti-cyclone, which caused so much misery, look like?”;  “Are there any changes in atmosphere?”;  “You, or rather the USOS, are also dealing with off-nominal situation, the cooling system has failed.  Did it somehow impact your life conditions?”;  “Your US colleagues have already carried out several EVAs to install the new pump.  What was your participation in these tasks?”;  “Please pass our happy birthday wishes to the intrepid Tracy Caldwell-Dyson on behalf of our magazine!!!”;  “Do you stay in radio contact with HAM radio operators?”  “Who are these people? What do you talk about with them?”  “Tell us about your plans for the next month.”]
 
  CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4 &amp; FE-6 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Alex at ~7:15am, Shannon at ~1:50pm, Tracy at ~3:30pm, Wheels at ~5:00pm EDT.
