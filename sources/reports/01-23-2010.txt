ISS On-Orbit Status 01/23/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – full-duty day.
 
  FE-4 Kotov began his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  CDR Williams &amp; FE-6 Creamer continued their current week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), donning their Actiwatches, from which to log data to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Maxim Suraev had 2h50m for undertaking his 4<sup>th</sup> onboard session with the Russian biomedical MBI-15 "Pilot-M"/NEURO signal response experiment after setting up the workplace and equipment, with Kotov acting as Operator.  Later, the Pilot-M &amp; Neurolab-2000M gear was disassembled &amp; stowed away, and Max reported to TsUP-Moscow on his run.    [MBI-15 requires the Multipurpose Hardware Bench as a table, ankle restraint system, eyeball electrodes for an EOG (electrooculogram), and two hand controllers (RUO &amp; RUD) for testing piloting skill in “flying” simulations on a laptop (RSK1) with software (v. 2.0) under stopwatch control, as well as for studying special features of the psychophysiologic response of cosmonauts to the effects of stress factors in flight.]
 
  Oleg Kotov conducted a session with the Russian science payload BIMS (MBI-22) which included otoscopic, nasal, dental and dermatological exams for evaluating the skin and mucous membranes for any changes over long-duration space missions, based on video and digital photography to capture areas of skin, gums, nasal passages and the ear canal.     [BIMS objective is to conduct several experimental sessions in the RS (Russian Segment) for filming skin portions and mucous membranes of crewmembers.  It is part of a comprehensive research into using telemedical technologies for getting information from distant space crews for medical support of human space missions and information for life science flight studies.  The BIMS experiment uses image capturing (video &amp; still photo), an otoscope (or auriscope - the familiar medical device for visualizing the outer &amp; middle ear, nose and upper throat area), the RSE-med laptop and PCMCIA memory cards, with data files downlink via BSR-TM to study small skin sites, conduct otorhinolaryngologic examinations (external acoustic meatus, eardrums, nasal passages), and do stomatologic (i.e., medical study of mouth and its diseases) examination of gums and teeth.]
 
  CDR Williams &amp; FE-6 Creamer, assisted by FE-5 Noguchi, spent several hours on successfully relocating the PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3).  Activities, which went very well, included –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Checkout of both Lab &amp;      Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) laptops,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Final PMA-3 internal      pressure check for leaks, then tearing down the 5-ft ISA/VAJ (Internal Sampling      Adapter / Vacuum Access Jumper) used for the leak test,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Setting Node-1 Port &amp;      Node-2 Zenith hatches to unlatch position (to minimize probability/effects      of a hatch mechanism jam which would preclude opening hatch for ingress of      PMA-3 on Node-2 Zenith, or Node-3 on Node-1 Port during STS-130/20A),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Powering up &amp; checking      out the CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System) in Node-2 for the PMA-3      berthing.</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Grappling PMA-3 with the      SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) at the Node-1 port      location,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Demating PMA-3 from the      Node-1 Nadir CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Maneuvering PMA-3 to      pre-install position at Node-2 Zenith port,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Installing PMA-3 on the      Node-2 Zenith port,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Capturing with the CBM      &amp; tightening ABOLTS (Acquire Bolts),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Ungrappling SSRMS and      maneuvering to Lab PDGF (Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture) for 20A Base      checkout, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Deinstalling and removing      the CBCS.</li> </ul> 
 [PMA-3 needed to be relocated from Node-1/Port to Node-2/Zenith in order to make way for STS-130/20A to install Node-3 in its place on Node-1/Port.] 
 
  The FE-1 completed the routine task of shooting two photos of the docking cone of the passive docking assembly (ASP-B) of the MRM2 port occupied by the Soyuz TMA-16, a standard practice after Russian dockings.  These images are used to refine current understanding of docking conditions.  Suraev subsequently downlinked the pictures via OCA assets.     [The objective is to take photo imagery of the scratch or scuff marks left by the head of the docking probe on the internal surface of the drogue (docking cone, ASP) ring, now rotated out of the passageway.  Before shooting the picture, the cosmonaut highlights the scuffmark with a marker and writes the date next to it.  As other crewmembers before him, Maxim used the Nikon D2X digital still camera to take two pictures with the hatch partially closed.]
 
  Afterwards, Suraev conducted the periodic collection of air samples, including checking for Freon, in the SM (Service Module) &amp; FGB using the AK-1M adsorber, recording date, time &amp; location.   FE-1 also used the Russian IPD-NH<sub>3</sub> Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (Carbon Monoxide).  The samplers were stowed for subsequent return to Earth.
 
  With the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system temporarily turned off, Kotov deinstalled the BKGA Gas Analyzer Calibration Assembly in the SM.
 
  The Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator was then reactivated by ground commanding, with Oleg monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.    [The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.  Elektron had to be turned off while BITS &amp; VD-SU were off.]
 
  In the Soyuz TMA-17/21S, the FE-4 removed and replaced the BlP Console Logic Unit for the BVN Air Heater Fan.
 
  Oleg also had ~2.5 hrs to perform IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the RS EPS (Electrical Power System), taking out unit #2 of the six 800A batteries in the FGB and replacing it with a new 800A battery from FGB stowage.     [The activity involved working with wrenches, screwdriver, tweezers and gray tape, plus demating &amp; remating five cable connectors.]
 
  Creamer had Day 2 with the Nutrition/Repository/Pro K protocol, today executing the FD30 (Flight Day 30) blood draw session, after stowing the samples from the 24-hr urine collections started yesterday in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Noguchi assisted as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  TJ also captured a photo of the pH log sheet and the diet log sheet and transferred it to the SSC (Station Support Computer) in preparation for downlink.  His next Nutrition/Repository/Pro K activity is the FD60 session.     [The operational products for Blood &amp; Urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads have been revised, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
  Jeff retrieved &amp; stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies, deployed on 1/21 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.     [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
  In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Soichi Noguchi serviced the Dewey’s Forest science payload, which requires periodic watering for the cultivation of its PUs (Plant Units).     [Dewey’s Forest, one of the Japanese educational payloads, is intended to show how gravity controls the laws of nature and influences our ways of thinking. The project is “a catalyst to rediscover our relationship with plants on the ground and the age-old history of our gardens.”]
 
  Also in the Kibo module, Soichi supported Japanese payload ops by turning on the Argon gas supply of the CGSE (Common Gas Support Equipment).
 
  Later, the FE-5 downlinked a playback of the 63-min miniDV video tape recorded on 1/16 of his onboard activities for JAXA.
 
  In the SM, FE-1 Suraev did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Maxim also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).
 
 Reboost maneuver:   CDR Williams closed the protective shutters of the Lab &amp; JPM science windows in preparing for the ISS reboost maneuver #2 scheduled for early tomorrow morning (4:01am EST), to be performed for 2min 34s by the SM Main Engines.  The combination of this reboost and the prior 1/22 reboost will set up phasing for 36P launch and several FD3 rendezvous launch opportunities for STS-130/20A.  Expected delta-V: 2.85 m/s; delta-h increase: 4.93 km.
