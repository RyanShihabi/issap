ISS On-Orbit Status 09/26/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Day 73 for Williams, Malenchenko &amp; Hoshide.
 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">ATV3 “Edoardo Amaldi” undocking, planned for 6:31pm last night, was called off when the ATV Control Panel test &amp; laptop command test failed due to a communications error between the SM’s MBRL/PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment) and ATV avionics.  Undocking has been postponed to (at least) Friday, 9/28, because of a conjunction of ISS with debris from an Indian PSLV rocket with a TCA (Time of Closest Approach) tomorrow at ~10:42am EDT.  A DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver), if required, would be conducted at 8:12am tomorrow morning, using the ATV3 OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters for a delta-V target of about 0.3 m/s.</li></ul> 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Crew Sleep Cycle Shift:  Due to yesterday’s late sleeptime (10:30pm), crew wake-up this morning was shifted by 5 hrs, to 7:00am.  Tonight, sleep/work cycle returns to “normal” (5:30pm-2:00am). </li></ul> 
After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
Yuri also completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops.
 
CDR Williams began her 4<sup>th</sup> suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of pH testing.  After recording her diet input today, Sunita will begin the urine collections on Day 4, Saturday (9/29) and blood sampling (fasted) on Day 5, Sunday (9/30), with Pro K photography.       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.]
 
FE-6 Hoshide conducted another sampling run with the AQM (Air Quality Monitor), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.      [Consisting of the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
Afterwards, Akihiko set up the first of four Makita power tool batteries for recharge, following with the other three during the day, for his next ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session, scheduled on 9/28.
 
In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Aki later configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware with power, data, front panel, and gas connections plus MBS (Mixing Bag System), and then conducted his 3<sup>rd</sup> session with the Sprint VO<sub>2</sub>max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake &amp; Submaximal Estimates of VO<sub>2</sub>max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, including software &amp; instrument calibrations, checking instruments, exercise protocol, cessation, and data downlink.  These activities were executed several times.  After the session, FE-6 powered down, cleaned up &amp; partially stows the equipment, then downloaded the data to a PCS laptop.        [The experiment Sprint VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  Sprint VO<sub>2</sub>max is a test that measures oxygen uptake, ventilatory threshold, and other physiological parameters for evaluation of Sprint exercise prescription. The in-flight exercise protocol consists of multiple stages.  Both the VO<sub>2</sub>max and Sprint experiments require monthly max tests in-flight, but each use a different protocol to obtain the data.  Joint VO<sub>2</sub>max/Sprint subjects use the VO<sub>2</sub>max protocol.  Suni is performing the VO<sub>2</sub>max protocol, Aki the Sprint Max protocol.  Suni is the last VO<sub>2</sub>max subject.  Aki is the first Sprint subject not also participating in VO<sub>2</sub>max.  The Sprint protocol requires less Portable PFS accessory hardware than the VO<sub>2</sub>max protocol. However, for consistency, both crew will complete the full hardware setup.]
 
Yuri Malenchenko configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 3<sup>rd</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
Next, Yuri had ~1h for transferring cargo (trash, excessed equipment, etc.) to Progress M-16M/48P for disposal.     [48P is scheduled to undock in February next year.]
 
Williams powered up the ISS amateur/ham radio stations and re-opened the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola &amp; JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).
 
Sunita also spent about 1h15m on prepacking cargo for return to Earth on the SpaceX-1 Dragon capsule.
 
In the Kibo JPM, Aki depressed the JEMAL (JEM Air lock) for upcoming ground-controlled SSOD (Small Satellite Orbital Deployer) operations.
 
FE-4 performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Working next in the Soyuz TMA-05M/31S spacecraft, docked at MRM1 Rassvet, Yuri performed the periodic cleaning of the screen of the spacecraft’s BVN air heater.
 
Sunita made preparations for the upcoming (9/28) R&amp;R (removal &amp; replacement) of a failed RPCM (Remote Power Controller Module) at loc. Lab P5, gathering equipment and a spare RPCM for temporary stowage.
 
Afterwards, Suni conducted the periodic inspection of the PEPs (Portable Emergency Provisions) and their locations, checking PFEs (Portable Fire Extinguishers, PBAs (Portable Breathing Apparatus) and HTKs (Extension Hose Tee Kits).     [PFEs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in A/L (Airlock), 2 in Lab,1 in Node-2, 1 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM.   PBA O<sub>2</sub> Bottles:  3 in FGB, 5 in A/L, 6 in Node-1, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM.  QDMAs or Prebreathe Masks: 3 in FGB, 8 in A/L, 3 in Node-1, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL, 1 in PMM.  EHTKs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 1 in Node-3.]
 
The CDR also completed the standard 30-day inspection of the AED (Automated External Defibrillator) in the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) rack.       [AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient.  It then can treat them through defibrillation, i.e., the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.]
 
Yuri completed his 5<sup>th</sup> collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.      [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Aki used the pumping equipment to transfer the water from the degassed CWC-I #2052 &amp; #2020 to the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) Potable Water tank using a “tee” hose and a freshly installed MRF (Microbial Removal Filter) cartridge as gas trap.  To be continued tomorrow.    [During the day, with MCC-H monitoring, Aki checked transfer progress and purged gas from the MRF, as required, to allow water to flow from CWC-I to the Potable Water tank.]
 
FE-4 supported the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 by downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.]
 
Yuri Malenchenko supported the overnight test of the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) in the SM by copying the test data collected overnight from the to the RSS2 laptop for data downlink and log file dump, supported by ground specialist tagup.
 
Before sleeptime, Malenchenko started the RSE-SLS A31p laptop for running the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) overnight during crew sleep.   [Purpose: To conduct another LCS space experiment session (no transmitter activation) of the external BTLS-N (LCS terminal) between 10:09pm-10:42pm and dump the log file.] 
 
After her successful R&amp;R of the three ASVs (Air Selector Valves) 102, 103 &amp; 104 of the Node-3 CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) on 9/24, Suni restowed the removed valves.
 
Later, the CDR performed the periodic maintenance of the ARED advanced resistive exercise machine of evacuating its cylinder flywheels to re-establish proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.
 
The crew worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-6) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR).     [CDR &amp; FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.]
 
At ~10:50am, Sunita configured the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 11:00am conducted a ham radio session with students at Sacred Heart School of Halifax, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.
 
Before exercising on the ARED, Aki Hoshide set up and checked out the G1 video camera for it to record her workout session on the machine, meeting the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.
 
Before Presleep (~3:30pm), the CDR powers up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Suni turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
Tasks listed for FE-4 Malenchenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Taking situational photography behind panels 327 &amp; 428 in the SM to assess the feasibility of installing a KL-108/109Ts “Klest” unit (to be delivered on Progress 51P) for downlinking digital TV from the RS (Russian Segment).</li></ul> 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Buenos Aires, Argentina (Capital Cities Collection:  ISS had an early afternoon pass with clear weather expected for this sprawling capital city of nearly 3 million located on the SW shore of the broad estuary of the Rio de la Plata. At this time the crew was to begin looking left of track for this target and try to acquire the entire urban area within a single frame), and Woollya Cove, Chile (HMS Beagle Site:  This challenging target is located well right of track among small islands south of Tierra del Fuego. Charles Darwin visited here in 1834 as one of the first stops in his journey through this region. ISS had a late afternoon pass with the potential for some clouds in the sky. At this time, as ISS tracked eastward over extreme southern Patagonia, the crew was to look obliquely right of track and try for overlapping frames of the islands and inlets of Tierra del Fuego).
