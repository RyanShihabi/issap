ISS On-Orbit Status 12/04/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
After wakeup, FE-2 Tarelkin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection and also completed the daily reboot of the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops.
 
FE-1 Novitskiy rebooted the Russian RS1 &amp; RS2 laptops.
 
Afterwards, Oleg performed the routine verification of yesterday’s automated refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2.     [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the SSCV4 software update some time ago.  Before the installation on 8/8/11 of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.]
CDR Ford performed regular maintenance on the JAXA MOST (Medaka Osteoclast [killifish]) AQH (Aquatic Habitat) Aquariums 1 &amp; 2, testing their water quality using nitrate &amp; nitrite test strips from the Lab MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) Dewar 4 to measure the concentration of ammonium, nitrate and nitrite in water samples from the WCU (Water Circulation Unit) and supplying fresh water to the WCU. The test strips were then returned to MELFI-3.
 
Ford also reviewed OCBT (Onboard Computer-Based Training) for accessing the NanoRacks platforms, reconfiguring modules and operating the NanoRacks and Microscope-2, preparatory to work scheduled tomorrow.
 
Evgeny Tarelkin used the NIKON D3 digital camera with NIKON SB800 flash to take pictures of the IWIS (Internal Wireless Instrumentation System) accelerometers in the FGB and SM and later downlinked the photographs via RSPI (High-Speed Data Transmission Radio Link).     [To gain access, FE-2 had to open panels 226 (portside) in FGB and 234 (portside) in SM, then temporarily clear all cargo items stowed behind the panels. IWIS uses radio-linked accelerometers (RSUs) in SM, Lab, Node, FGB, Airlock and Nodes, controlled by a network control unit (NCU) to take structural dynamics (vibratory) measurements, particularly during docking and undocking events. Its software runs on an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop. There is also an EWIS (External Wireless Instrumentation System) on ISS.]
 
Working in the SM, Novitskiy installed and mated a payload patch cable at the two NVM-1,2 navigation computer modules of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System behind panel 228.
 
After setting up the Lab G1 camcorder for live coverage of his activities from the Node-1 side, Kevin supported POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center/Huntsville) by performing manifold bottle swaps on one of four manifolds (B) on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in front of the Optics Bench.    [Steps included opening the upper doors, removing CIR manifold bottle F #2001 with 30% O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) and 70% He (helium) remaining and replacing it with manifold bottle B #2017 containing 40% O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) and 60% He (helium), then placing the manual vent valve in VENT position, GIP valve lever in Up (open) position, closing the upper rack doors again, turning on two switches, and notifying POIC of rack readiness for remote commanding.]
 
Novitskiy continued the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok) where he replaced its PF1 &amp; PF2 dust collector filter cartridges with new spares, discarding the old units, and later cleaned filter &amp; fan grille of the TsV1 central circulation ventilator using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush.
 
Evgeny undertook the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from a CWC (Contingency Water Container) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container (#100). Once filled, the EDV is connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.]
 
Oleg completed the periodic calibration &amp; adjustment test of the O<sub>2</sub> sensor of the SM SOGS (Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System) IK0501 gas analyzer (GA), using the BKGA/Gas Analyzer Calibration Assembly and IGZ/Analyzer Status Indicator (constituent meter).      [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2,</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed. Result for O<sub>2</sub> channel output should be 2.8 volts.]
 
With STTS communications configured for work in MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2), FE-1 Novitskiy conducted another session with the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), activating the hardware with electromagnet and video camcorder and completing the experiment run, which FE-2 Tarelkin video-recorded with the SONY HVR-Z1J for subsequent downlink via RSPI.       [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in a magnetic field (trap), investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS (Russian Segment): condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
Working ~2.5 hrs in the SM, Evgeny first took acoustic background &amp; noise level measurements with the SLM (Sound Level Meter), then replaced the SOTR (Thermal Control System) ventilators VPO7 &amp; VGZhT2 with new low-noise fans. Afterwards, FE-2 again measured the acoustics with the new fans activated and then took documentary photography.  The outfitting was supported by ground specialist tagup.
 
In the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Kevin Ford had ~2h45m set aside for configuring the FSL (Fluid Sciences Laboratory) Rack for upcoming RIC ASW (Rack Interface Controller Application SoftWare) testing and GEOFLOW2b experiment runs.      [Activities consisted of removing &amp; stowing the video by-pass connector, removal &amp; stowage of the Optical Target 2, and installing the GEOFLOW EC (Experiment Container) instead. Next, the SAMS SE (Space Acceleration Measurement System Sensor Enclosure) and its associated cable had to be mounted onto the FSL ODM (Optical Diagnostics Module) seat track and the four AVM brackets installed to prevent the unwanted extraction of the FCE (Facility Core Element) from the FSL Rack. Before experiment start, the locking bolts of the FCE need to be unlocked to improve the micro-G condition.] 
 
Tarelkin took on the daily routine job of servicing the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Novitskiy completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Before Presleep (~2:30pm EST), Ford powers up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and started the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Kevin turns MPC routing off again.    [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
FE-1 &amp; FE-2 had their standard weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Oleg at ~12:25pm, Evgeny at ~1:20pm EST.
 
The three crewmembers worked out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).

CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Storm Bay, Tasmania (HMS BEAGLE SITE:  ISS had a partly cloudy pass for this target in mid-afternoon light with its approach from the SW. Charles Darwin and the Beagle visited this part of Australia in 1836. At this time as ISS tracked just south of the island of Tasmania, the crew was to look just left of track for a mapping pass of this feature), Kunene River Fan, NAM-AGO (ISS had a fair weather pass in clear weather and mid-morning light with all of this target area to the left of track. This large alluvial fan lies between the Kunene River in Angola [north] and Namibia’s Etosha Pan [south] and is subject to periodic flooding from the north. At this time, as ISS tracked southeastward just inland from the Atlantic, the crew was to begin a mapping strip of the area of the fan. Recent floods reached down the length of the fan to Etosha Pan, the low point of the basin. Open water may still have been visible in many parts of the fan), Kerguelen Islands, Indian Ocean (summer is slow to come to this remote glacier-capped archipelago in the southern Indian Ocean but there may have been a break in the weather at the time of the ISS pass. Cook Glacier, on the high west side, is the focus of interest. With an area of ~403 km2 it is quoted as "France's largest glacier," since the islands are a French possession. ISS had a midday pass with your approach from the W. Looking just left of track for views of this target area), Matavai Bay, Tahiti (HMS BEAGLE SITE:  As ISS approached from the NW in early morning light and partly cloudy weather, the crew was to begin looking just left of track for the north coast of Tahiti, the largest island and Matavai Bay. Darwin stopped here in November 1835 near the present capital city, Papeete. In Darwin's words: " …we landed to enjoy all the delights of the first impressions produced by a new country …  Crowds of men, women &amp; children were collected on the memorable point Venus ready to receive us…".  Darwin climbed a narrow river gorge heading towards the central peak of the island, remarking, "These precipices must have been some thousand feet high; the whole formed a mountain gorge far more magnificent than anything I had ever beheld."), and Foelsche Impact, NA-AUS (ISS had a fair-weather, early afternoon pass for this target located just inland from Australia’s Gulf of Carpentaria. Its approach was from the NW with this 6-km-diameter impact crater just right of track. Although the crew may not have been able to spot it at the time, it stands out as a lighter-toned, circular feature. Ages of the surrounding rocks show that the impact occurred more than 545 million years ago.
