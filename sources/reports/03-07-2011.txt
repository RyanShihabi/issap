ISS and STS-133/Discovery are flying in separate orbits again.     [After a total docked time of 8d 16h 49min, Discovery undocked from PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 2) in darkness (local sunset 6:48am EST) at 7:00am.  Sunrise: 7:24am.  After separation, PLT Eric Boe completed a 360-deg station flyaround, and the Orbiter crew obtained photo/video imagery of the ISS.  Final sep burn (Sep 2) was at ~8:43am, retrograde (as for 12 of the last 14 flights).  Discovery returns to Earth on 3/9 (Wednesday) after its 14-day mission.  First landing opportunity at KSC is at 11:58am.  Weather predictions are quite favorable.]
 
FE-4 Dmitri Kondratyev started the day by undertaking the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-6 Cady Coleman undertook her 12<sup>th</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for her last night.       [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
CDR Scott Kelly started another week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Scott’s 9<sup>th</sup> session, transferring data from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, US crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
FE-1 Alex Kaleri &amp; FE-2 Oleg Skripochka completed their 3<sup>rd</sup> preliminary orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test run with the Russian Chibis suit in preparation for their return to gravity on 3/16 with Soyuz 24S (along with Scott Kelly).  They conducted the ODNT exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure ODNT device (US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill.  Each crewmember took turns as Subject and CMO (Crew Medical Officer).   Oleg was supported in his one-hour session by ground specialist tagup via VHF at 6:31am, Alex at 8:02am EST.     [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by one cycle of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -30, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG SHKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
Kondratyev completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated later tonight (~3:28pm EST) before sleeptime, followed tomorrow by Bed #2 regeneration.     [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days. (Last time done: 2/14-16.]
 
Kaleri had ~45 min set aside for personal preparations for his return on 24S next week.
 
Skripochka performed the periodic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary (non-network) laptops RSS1, RSS2 &amp; RSK2 which are not loaded from the ground, from a special software program working with Norton AV on the FS (File Server) laptop.     [After first scanning the FS laptop, the virus database was transferred by flash-card to the other computers, which were then scanned one by one.   Background:  Regularly on Mondays, automatic virus definition file updates are verified on the RSS2, RSS1, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2 laptops, while the non-networked laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1 are manually updated.  Antivirus scans are then started &amp; monitored on RSS2 &amp; RSE-Med.  Results of the scans on RSS1, RSK1-T61p, RSK2 &amp; RSE1 are verified on Tuesdays.  Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p &amp; RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.]
 
FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE4 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Oleg at ~10:18am, Dima at ~10:43am, Sasha at ~1:48pm EST.
 
At ~9:03am, Paolo Nespoli had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).        [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is done regularly after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
No CEO targets uplinked for today.
