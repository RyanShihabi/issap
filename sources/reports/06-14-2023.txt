Systems:
ISS Roll Out Solar Array (IROSA) 1B Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation Activities: In preparation for Thursday’s IROSA 1B EVA, the crew completed EVA procedure reviews and prints, robotics procedure reviews, and an EVA procedure conference with the ground. The crew also performed Equipment Lock (E-LK) preparation, EVA tool configuration and audit, Pistol Grip Tool (PGT) Battery Installation, and Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) Setup. IROSA is a modification to the existing Solar Array Wings (SAWs), providing additional power to the station.
Environmental Health Systems (EHS) On-Orbit Sampling: The crew deployed two Formaldehyde Monitoring Kits (FMKs) in designated sample locations for post-flight analysis of on-orbit formaldehyde levels. The crew also used a Grab Sample Container (GSC) to collect instantaneous air samples for post-flight analysis. Sampling is performed every 45 days.
