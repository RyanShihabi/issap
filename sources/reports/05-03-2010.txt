ISS On-Orbit Status 05/03/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Underway: Week 7 of Increment 23. Crew is back on normal wake/sleep cycle (2:00am – 5:30pm EDT).
 At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the currently running Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Before breakfast, FE-6 Creamer continued his current medical protocol of Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), his 4<sup>th</sup> onboard run, performing the urine pH spot test (not sampling) and later logging his dietary intake.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 Both Timothy and Tracy started out on a new week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s 5<sup>th</sup>, Tracy’s 2<sup>nd</sup>, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Afterwards, FE-6 completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Later, TJ ended the 24-hr urine collections for his Nutrition/Repository/Pro K protocol and undertook the associated generic blood collection protocol, with FE-5 Noguchi assisting with the phlebotomy as operator.  TJ then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).
 
 All crewmembers started out with the periodic before-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement, using the IM mass measurement device.  Kotov set up the IM and later stowed it away.  The three Russian crewmembers, Kotov, Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko, also completed the PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement protocol.     [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IM "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ].
 
 FE-3 Kornienko continued the integration of the newly arrived Progress M-05M/37P into the station systems by installing the LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry system and its ROM/read-only memory unit (PZU TA765B) in the spacecraft, both kept in storage from an earlier Progress.
 
 Afterwards, Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko replaced/updated RODF (Russian Operations Data File) books with new procedural material delivered on 37P.    [The updates, separate sheets and cards, involve 18 books – on MO Medical Experiments, TE Technical Experiments, BTKh Biotechnology, SOTR Thermal Control System, RK Deactivation/Activation, SPPZ Fire Protection System, RSU Manual Controls, SUDN Guidance, Navigation &amp; Control System, BVS Computer System, SEP Electrical Power System, RTK Communications System, ViA Video &amp; Audio, GF Geophysics, TORU, PTO FGB IVA IFM Part 1, PTO MRM2 IFM IVA, and RPR Progress 37P Cargo Transfer Ops.]  
 
 FE-1 &amp; FE-3 spent several hours with the transfer of equipment &amp; supplies from the cargo ship to the ISS.
 
 Kotov transferred excessed equipment &amp; trash to Progress M-04M/36P for stowage prior to its separation on 5/10.
 
 Skvortsov also unloaded the new RBO-3-2 Matryoshka-R hardware from Progress 37P and transferred its SPD kits to the station for installation.      [Background:  The Matryoshka facility has been used on the ISS for radiation science experiments since 2004, as follows:  MTR-1 was performed outside the ISS/SM with active &amp; passive detectors 2/26/04 – 8/18/05; MTR-2A was performed inside (DC-1), with passive detectors only, 1/5/06 – 12/7/06); MTR-2B was conducted inside the Russian part of the ISS (DC-1 &amp; SM) with active &amp; passive detectors from 10/18/07 – 3//09.  The new Matryoshka-Kibo is the fourth experiment performed with the Matryoshka facility onboard the ISS; it covers for the first time measurements made inside the Japanese Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), complementing the earlier Matryoshka results by adding radiation data acquired during a different phase of the solar cycle.  For Matryoshka-Kibo, a new set of passive dosimeters will be delivered to the ISS on Progress and shortly thereafter installed in the “Phantom” which then will be transferred to its stowage location inside Kibo.] 
 
 In the SM, Kotov checked up on the KRIOGEM-03M container which he had switched to +4 degC temperature yesterday.
 
 In preparation for the relocation of the Soyuz TMA-17/21S spacecraft on 5/12 (from FGB Nadir to SM Aft), its three crewmembers, Kotov, Noguchi &amp; Creamer, donned their Sokol spacesuits and conducted the standard suit leak checks in Soyuz TMA-17/21S.  Afterwards, Oleg set up the Sokol suits for drying out, followed by their gloves. 
 
 Also for the 21S relocation, FE-3 Kornienko configured and ran a test of the STTS communications system’s VHF/Channel 2 (Very High Frequency, Russian: UKV2, for ultra-shortwave) with an RGS (Russian Groundsite). 
 
 For the arrival of STS-132/Atlantis/ULF4 with the Russian Rassvet MRM1 module on 5/16, the six crewmembers conducted a joint 50-min training/review of the ULF4 flight plan and timeline, followed at ~10:50am by a 30-min teleconference with ground specialists to discuss the ULF4 docked period.   (Flight Plan see below.)
 
 Caldwell-Dyson equipped the two VTRs (Video Tape Recorders) in the Lab with fresh tape.     [VTR1 is at loc. P(Port) 5, VTR2 at S(Starboard) 5.]
 
 Caldwell-Dyson spent several hours with the new IV Gen (Intravenous Fluids Generation) payload.  Tracy first configured the Lab camcorder for providing a live view &amp; activating/inspecting the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), then familiarized herself with IV Gen procedures and set up the payload with its associated SAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System) in the MSG.  Before powering the MSG down again, Tracy also performed leak tests on the GN<sub>2</sub> (gaseous Nitrogen) hose and QDs (quick disconnects).    [IV Gen will demonstrate a prototype system to produce SWI (Sterile Water for Injection) in a zero-G environment.  Fluid physics data will allow for appropriate system scaling to meet advanced requirements of medical treatment and care capabilities for exploration missions to remote places.  Operating within the MSG, the experiment will produce bags of purified water from potable water, preferably the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) output or from CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine) stores.  GN<sub>2</sub> will be used to push the water into the Purifier.  After purification, the water is mixed with NaCl (Sodium Chloride, i.e. common table salt) to produce a normal saline solution for intravenous infusion.  This solution will be returned to Earth for testing.] 
 
 TJ Creamer configured the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) for regular service on the science payload APEX-Cambium (Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit-Cambium), then harvested Run 2B plants of the TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System) experiment using Chamber 1, chemically preserving the GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) reporter gene plants for post-flight analysis and inserting “2C” Petri plates.  Documentary photography was also taken.     [When completed, the APEX-Cambium payload will help in resolving two scientific questions: First, the CSA-sponsored Cambium experiment will determine the role of gravity in Cambium wood cell development (providing the pulp &amp; paper and construction industries insight into the fundamental mechanisms of wood cell formation), and secondly, the NASA-sponsored TAGES will demonstrate non-destructive reporter gene technology &amp; investigate spaceflight plant stress. APEX-Cambium provides NASA &amp; the International ISS community a permanent controlled environment capability to support growth of various organisms (i.e. whole plants).]
 
 FE-6 also started another sampling run (the 91<sup>st</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 With the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) again running nominally, producing water from urine, FE-2 performed another fill of the UPA WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly), from a Russian EDV-U (urine collector-water container), using the EDV transfer hose, instead of PTU (Pretreat Urine) T-valve, and an electric compressor.
 
 Kornienko &amp; Skvortsov spent ~30 min checking out and familiarizing themselves with the CMRS (Crew Medical Restraint System).  They also performed the periodic inspection of the HMS RSP (Health Maintenance System Respiratory Support Pack).     [The board-like CMRS allows strapping down a patient on the board with a harness for medical attention by the CMO (Crew Medical Officer) who is also provided with restraints around the device.  CMRS can be secured to the ISS structure within two minutes to provide a patient restraint surface for performing emergency medical procedures, such as during ACLS (advanced cardiac life support).  It can also be used to transport a patient between the station and the Orbiter middeck.  It isolates the crew and equipment electrically during defibrillations and pacing electrical discharges, accommodates the patient in the supine zero-G positions, provides cervical spine stabilization and can also restrain two CMOs at the same time during their delivery of medical care.]
 
 Additionally, FE-3 Mikhail Kornienko –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Conducted the periodic update of the IUS AntiVirus program in the Russian VKS auxiliary (non-network) laptops RSK1, RSK2, RSE1, RSE2, which are not loaded from the ground, from a new uplinked program copy of Norton AV on the FS (File Server) laptop, first scanning the latter, then transferring the database by flash-card to the other computers and scanning them one by one  [only the RSS2 laptop is automatically updated (once a week on Fridays from MCC-Houston)],</li><li>Performed another photography run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera (with SIGMA AF 300-800mm telelens) of specific targets,</li><li>Completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers], and</li><li>Did the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.</li></ul> 
 FE-1 Alexander Skvortsov meanwhile –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), and</li><li>Performed another photography &amp; video session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining data on color bloom patterns of ocean surface areas, then copying the images &amp; audio files of his commentary to the RSK-1 laptop.</li></ul> 
 Soichi &amp; Traci had 30 min reserved for studying SSRMS / SPDM (Space Station Remote Manipulator System / Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) grapple procedures, then set up a JOCAS (Joint Operator Commanded Auto Sequence) for moving the robot arm to pre-grapple position, after which they took over manually for maneuvering in and grappling the SPDM, followed by connecting umbilicals and clean-up.
 
 Later, Noguchi set up the SLM (Sound Level Meter) and performed the periodic extensive 2.5-hr. acoustic survey which is required once every two months in all ISS modules.  The subsequent data download to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) was a separate timeline activity.    [There were 36 measurements (6 locations @ 6 readings) in Node-2, nine measurement locations in Node-3.]
 
 FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their regular PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Soichi at 8:00am, TJ at ~2:05pm EDT.
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1). 
 
 No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
 
 STS-132/Atlantis/ULF-4 Flight Plan Preview:
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Atlantis’ 12-day mission will deliver the Russian-built MRM-1 (Mini Research Module-1) that will provide additional storage space and a new docking port for Russian Soyuz &amp; Progress spacecraft.  MRM-1, also known as Rassvet, which means Dawn in Russian, will be permanently attached to the nadir port of the station’s FGB module.  MRM-1 will carry important hardware on its exterior including a radiator, airlock and a European robotic arm.  Atlantis also will deliver additional station hardware stored inside a cargo carrier.  Three spacewalks (by Reisman, Bowen &amp; Good) are planned to stage spare components outside the station, including six spare batteries, a Ku-band antenna and spare parts for the Canadian Dextre robotic arm.  Shuttle mission STS-132 is the final scheduled flight for Atlantis. </li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Launch:       5/14, 2:20pm EDT</li><li>Docking:      5/16, 10:20am</li><li>Undocking:  5/23, 11:12am</li><li>Landing:      5/26, 8:36am.</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Atlantis, on its last flight, is crewed by</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>CDR – Ken Ham (Prime Loadmaster) </li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>PLT  – Tony Antonelli </li><li>MS1 – Garrett Reisman (EV1)</li><li>MS2 – Mike Good  (EV3)</li><li>MS3 – Steve Bowen (EV2) </li><li>MS4 – Piers Sellers</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>MRM-1 Main Activities:</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>FD2: Ku Scheme/Video Test for MRM-1 Docking </li></ul> <ol style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 108pt; "> <li>Setup and testing will be similar to Soyuz Docking video</li><li>Equipment left in place until FD5</li></ol> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>FD5: MRM-1 Docking (performed by STS crew)</li></ul> <ol start="3" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 108pt; "> <li>SRMS unberth MRM-1 from PLB</li><li>SRMS handoff MRM-1 to SSRMS</li><li>SSRMS will berth to FGB Nadir</li><li>RS laptop deployed in USOS for docking ops</li></ol> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>FD7:  MRM-1 Hatch Open/Leak Check </li></ul> <ol start="7" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 108pt; "> <li>Initial ingress to scrub air</li><li>Hatch will be left “ajar”</li><li>Final, full ingress to occur TBD date post flight </li></ol> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Other Main Activieties:</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>FD3: Docking and ICC Unberth</li><li>FD4: EVA1</li><li>FD5: MRM-1 Docking to FGB Nadir and Focused Inspection</li><li>FD6: EVA 2</li><li>FD7: STS Water Dump and MRM-1 Hatch Open</li><li>FD8: EVA 3</li><li>FD9: ICC Berthing in PLB and Reboost</li><li>FD10: Undocking</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Focused inspection is nominally planned for FD5, though due to limited time availability this activity may be scheduled on its own flight day, if required.
