STS-133/Discovery (ULF-5) lifted off yesterday from Pad A at 4:53:23 pm EST, with only 2 seconds remaining in the launch window.  The launch was delayed due to issues that arose late in the count with the Range Safety System.  Prelaunch activities through the day proceeded with minimal problems and all vehicle systems worked as designed.  Rendezvous with the ISS is on 2/26, with docking at 2:16pm.  At launch time, ISS was well ahead (over the South Pacific at ~43.0 deg S, ~152.9 deg W), but Discovery is catching up.  We are off to another great mission!   This is the last flight for OV-103/Discovery.  Two planned Shuttle missions remain (STS-134 &amp; STS-135).        [The Orbiter is carrying the six-member crew of CDR Steve Lindsey, PLT Eric Boe, MS1 Alvin Drew, MS2 Steve Bowen, MS3 Michael Barratt, MS4 Nicole Stott,- all of them Shuttle veterans.  STS-133 is the 133<sup>rd</sup> space shuttle flight in history, the 39<sup>th </sup>for Discovery, and the 35<sup>th</sup> Shuttle flight to the ISS.  Primary payloads for Discovery are the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), converted from the former Italian-built MPLM (Multipurpose Logistics Module) Leonardo, the first human-like robot in space, Robonaut-2 (or R2), critical station hardware and the ELC4 (EXPRESS Logistics Carrier 4).  The mission includes two spacewalks, each about 6 hours in length, to be conducted on FD5 &amp; FD7 by Bowen (red stripes) &amp; Drew (no stripes).  Mission duration is 12 days with the possibility of a one-day extension if a Soyuz 24S Flyabout for documentary station photography is inserted on 3/5.]
 
FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-1 Kaleri &amp; FE-5 Nespoli focused most of their work today on accessing the newly arrived European ATV-2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2), docked at the SM (Service Module) aft port:
 
After Nespoli reviewed an OBT (Onboard Training) drill covering ATV APO (Attached Phase Operations) procedures to refresh his proficiency, –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">FE-1 &amp; FE-5 conducted the one-hour leak check on the SM PrK (Transfer Tunnel)/ATV vestibule (timing critical at 10:39am EST),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Alex &amp; Paolo installed the BZV quick release screw clamps of the SSVP docking mechanism,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Oleg sampled the air with the Russian AK-1M and Draeger IPD-CO sampling equipment,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Alex installed &amp; started the Russian air cleaner to scrub the ATV atmosphere (~11:00am; timing critical because the scrubbing may take up to 8 hrs), followed later tonight by</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Paolo completing final Ingress (wearing dust respirator &amp; vacuum cleaner) with Oleg repeating air samplings.</li></ul> 
Time-sequenced with Oleg’s AK-1M sampling, Scott Kelly used the US GSC (Grab Sample Container) equipment to collect air samples in the center of the ATV.
 
The CDR also initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer) and deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [This was the 20<sup>th</sup> session with the replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
Kelly, Nespoli &amp; Coleman spent part of their time on preparations for the RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) at tomorrow’s Shuttle arrival.    [Using NIKON D2Xs still cameras with 400mm &amp; 800mm lenses, Paolo (800 mm) &amp; Cady (400mm) will conduct the photographic bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of STS-133/Discovery/ULF5.  Scott will serve as Timer, with a stopwatch.   During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Discovery, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
Specifically, Scott started charging five batteries for the D2Xs cameras to be used for the RPM throughout the day.    [Batteries must be charged for at least three hours. Three batteries will be used for the D2Xs camera configuration and checkout in preparation for the RPM documentation. The 4th &amp; 5th batteries will be reserved as backup for the actual RPM.]
 
Also for the RPM, Cady Coleman configured the NIKON still cameras.
 
Later tonight, Kelly, Coleman &amp; Nespoli will join up in a one-hour review of RPM refresher videos and a final crew conference before Discovery’s arrival.
 
Using special wipes and sampling tubes, Oleg Skripochka had ~3 hrs for collecting surface samples from FGB structures &amp; equipment for microbial analysis on the ground.      [Oleg was to take documentary pictures if he found stains, mildew or dirt on cargo, equipment or structural elements.]
 
Later, Skripochka serviced the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet, downloading structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer during ATV docking to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.    [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.]
 
In the A/L (US Airlock), Scott Kelly removed the suspect HDD (Hard Disk Drive) #1069 from the A/L’s T61p laptop (shell #1040) and replaced it with a new HDD (#1056) which he ghosted (image-loaded) from a DVD with PCS R13.002 load.  The old disk was stowed.
 
Cady Coleman supported the DECLIC (Device for the Study of Critical Liquids &amp; Crystallization) experiment in ER4 (EXPRESS Rack 4) by removing the DSI (Directional Solidification Insert) from the DECLIC EXL (Experiment Locker), which required disconnecting a water hose.
 
In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), after retrieving a Ziploc bag with MDS (Microbial Detection Sheets) for the JAXA Microbe-2 experiment from MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) at 4 degC, Cady took surface samples in the JPM.     [The sampling used MDS spread out at specific sampling locations (Saibo Rack wall, Node-2/JEM hatch handrail, JPM OA1 diffuser) with moistened cover film open.  After taking documentary photography, the sampling sheets were transferred to MELFI-3 and the white packing tubes were trashed.]
 
Later, Cady Coleman set up the equipment for her saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol scheduled first thing tomorrow morning.       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmember soak a piece of cotton inside their mouth and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI.  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
Dmitri Kondratyev had ~2 hrs set aside for more cargo transfers from Progress M-09M/41P at DC1 nadir to ISS, moving cargo bags to the station for stowage and updating the IMS (Inventory Management System) with the BCR (Bar Code Reader).
 
CDR Kelly supported the ground in STS-133 preparations by pressurizing &amp; leak-checking the PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 2) for ingress, hatch opening and stowage after the Shuttle’s arrival.      [PMA-2, at the ISS bow, will be the docking port for Discovery tomorrow.  The VAJ/ISA (Vacuum Access Jumper / Internal Sampling Adapter) remains connected to MPEV (Manual Pressure Equalization Valve) for PMA-2 leak check after the docking.]
 
Scott also performed another regular module data take on the CubeLab and transferred files of collected data to laptop for downlink.     [CubeLab is a low-cost 1-kg platform for educational projects.  It is a multipurpose research facility that interfaces small standard modules into the ERs (EXPRESS Racks).  The modules can be used within the pressurized space station environment in orbit, with a nominal length, width, and height of 100 mm and a mass of no more than 1 g.  Up to 16 CubeLab modules can be inserted into a CubeLab insert inside an ER.]
 
Later, the CDR conducted routine service on the WRS (Water Recovery System) by offloading the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) storage tank from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary port to a CWC-I (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine) bag.  The PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) could not be used during the offloading.      [Estimated offload time: 23 min.]
 
Sasha Kaleri completed his 6<sup>th</sup> session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.       [Dmitri Kondratyev assisted in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes, applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit and taking documentary photography.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
Dima also performed the periodic inspection, photography and sample collection in the space behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM and around a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
Later, FE-4 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Kaleri handled the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
At ~9:53am EST, FE-4 Kondratyev downlinked, for TsUP taping, a special Russian PAO TV message, describing and demonstrating the small “Kedr” (Cedar) spacecraft delivered on Progress 41P in late January.  Showing it along with a UNESCO sign, Dmitri explained the spacecraft.      [“…The small satellite was named Kedr in honor of the call sign of Yuri Gagarin.  We are going to activate it onboard the station on April 12, 2011, on the day the whole world will celebrate the anniversary of our countryman’s flight.  Development, manufacturing and launch of Kedr is the first phase in Russia’s integrated program approved by UNESCO, with the goal to create and operate mini-satellites with a mass less than 100 kg by combined efforts of students across the world.  Once we activate Kedr, it will start transmitting 25 greetings in 15 languages, pictures of Earth, and telemetry data from science hardware and support systems, and historical audio recordings.  Thanks to Kedr, 50 years after Gagarin’s flight all ham radio operators across the world will have a unique opportunity to hear the famous “Poyekhali” (Let’s Go!) from Earth orbit.]
 
At ~6:23pm EST, all six crewmembers are scheduled for a 15-min Post-ATV Arrival Additional Emergency Steps Drill, supported by specialist tagup via S-band.     [Objectives of the OBT (Onboard Training) are to familiarize everyone with the location of ATV hardware to be used in emergencies, and to review the main features of ATV emergency response.  Focus is on leak isolation, fire in ATV and setting maximum power consumption mode.]
 
The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1/2x, FE-2/2x, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).        [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is done regularly after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
ATV Reboost Update:   A one-burn reboost of ISS was performed successfully this morning at 5:33am EST using the ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters.  Burn duration was 3 min 18 sec; delta-V: 0.5 m/s (1.6 ft/s); mean altitude gain: 0.86 km (0.43 nmi).  Purpose of the reboost was to test the ATV OCS thrusters as well as set up phasing for 24S landing and 26S launch.
 
Soyuz 24S Flyabout:    Roskosmos is still at work determining the feasibility of the postulated Flyabout of Soyuz 24 on 3/5 for one-of-a-kind historical &amp; documentary photography of the ISS from unique aspects and with all international transport ships attached. 
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Chiloe Island, southern Chile (HMS Beagle Site:  Darwin first arrived at Chiloe Island on June 12, 1834 and visited several places there.  It is 190 km in length, the largest of its group of coastal islands, and one of the wettest places South America.  ISS had a late morning pass with fair weather expected.  Approach was from the SW.  Looking just left of track for this rugged, forested island and trying for context views of the island as a whole), Dakar, Senegal (the capital city of Senegal has a population estimated at just over 1 million and dominates the promontory known as Cape Verde, Africa’s westernmost point.  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass in clear weather for this target with its approach from the SW.  As it approached the coast, the crew was to look nadir and try for a view of the entire urban area within a single frame), and San Salvador, El Salvador (it is the dry season for Central America and the crew had a near-nadir pass today with an approach from the SW in fair weather and mid-afternoon light.  The capital city of El Salvador with a metropolitan population of over 2 million is located in an interior valley, immediately to the west of Lake Llopango.   As ISS approached the coast, the crew was to begin looking for this target just inland.  CEO is seeking views of the entire urban area within a single frame).
