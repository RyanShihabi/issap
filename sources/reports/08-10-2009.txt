ISS On-Orbit Status 08/10/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Underway:  Week 11 of Increment 20.
 
  Upon wakeup, FE-1 Barratt, FE-2 Kopra, FE-4 Thirsk &amp; FE-5 DeWinne started a new session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), logging data from their Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a week-long session.    [To monitor the crewmember’s sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  For Thirsk, the day began with the extended “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment for which Bob ingested an Alendronate pill before breakfast.    [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  Early in the morning, FE-3 Romanenko performed the periodic checkup behind ASU panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
  Barratt &amp; DeWinne made preparations for and began a series of proficiency training sessions (OBT/Onboard Training) for Exp 20 on the HTV (H2 Transfer Vehicle) mission profile, the HTV Rendezvous crew procedures, and the HCP (Hardware Command Panel) for controlling the HTV.    [There are five HTV1 OBT events this week.  The first event, today, was a new HTV computer-based training OBT. The lesson walked through the H1 steps in the rendezvous procedures and provided representative RWS (Robotics Workstation) and PCS (Portable Computer System) screenshots for each step.  In addition, the lesson gave an overview of the HTV commands that are available to the crew and explained how to execute the commands via both the HCP and the HTV PCS pages.  The second event, also today, was a crew conference to discuss any questions remaining from the HTV OBT.  The next session, tomorrow, will be a ROBoT session; it will be supported by Robotics training and will focus on the 30m-through-capture timeline.  The next event, 8/12, is a conference with Frank DeWinne and Nicole Stott.  Finally, the last event, 8/14, is a ROBoT “mini-Sim” with a subset of the FCT (Flight Control Team), focusing on the integrated objectives and timeline from ~300m through capture.]
 
  FE-5 DeWinne installed and checked out the CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System) at the Node-2 nadir hatch in preparation for the arrival of the MPLM (Multipurpose Logistics Module) on Mission STS-128/17A.    [The electronics cable from the Lab plug-in was then disconnected and stowed to avoid hatch dragthrough.]
 
  FE-2 Kopra cleaned out EVA (Extravehicular Activity) gear stowed in the JLP (Japanese Experiment Logistics Module-Pressurized Section).
 
  FE-1 Barratt worked in the US A/L (Airlock), performing the regular midterm checkout on EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) 3011, including cycling the EMU’s PPRV (Positive Pressure Relief Valve).
 
  Afterwards, Barratt set up EMUs 3005 &amp; 3006 with their SCUs (Service &amp; Cooling Umbilicals) and initiated the standard one-hour scrubbing process on the spacesuits’ cooling water loops, filtering ionic and particulate matter (via a 3-micron filter), then reconfigured the cooling loops and started the ~2hr biocide filtering.  Scrubbing termination, disassembly of the EMU water processing kit and stowing the equipment followed.     [Loop scrubbing, incl. iodination of the LCVGs (Liquid Cooling &amp; Ventilation Garments) for biocidal maintenance is done to eliminate any biomass and particulate matter that may have accumulated in the loops.]
 
  Joined by FE-2 Timothy Kopra, FE-4 Bob Thirsk &amp; FE-5 Frank DeWinne, Mike then reviewed an overview package with STS-128/17A EVA tasks in preparation for a subsequent EVA task conference with ground specialists at ~11:50am EDT.
 
  Later, Tim deconfigured EMUs 3005 &amp; 3006 from loop scrub, checked out two SAFER (Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue) units, #1003, #1004, to be used during the upcoming EVAs, and “degassed” (removed air from) two EMU PWRs (Payload Water Reservoirs, #1024, #1025).
 
  Kopra also supported the JAXA MS (Marangoni Surface) experiment by removing &amp; replacing IPU VRU (Image Processing Unit/Video Recording Unit) hard disks.
 
  After all cargo delivered by Progress 34P was transferred to the ISS, with moves logged in the IMS (Inventory Management System), CDR Padalka &amp; FE-3 Romanenko began stowing excessed hardware in 34P for disposal.
 
  Roman used the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for Vinyl Chloride and Ethanol in the SM  [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur dioxide, Hydrogen cyanide, Phosgene, etc.],
 
  Supported by ground specialist tagup, Gennady Padalka transferred new TsVM (Central Computer) &amp; TVM (Terminal Computer) software images Vers. 8.03 to the KTsP2 (CPC2) Central Post Computer 2.
 
  Afterwards, Gennady updated the SUBA auxiliary laptop with a fresh antivirus load.
 
  The FE-2 removed the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) “Kabin” enclosure, then reconfigured the ITCS LAB1S2 RFCA (Internal Thermal Control System LAB1S2 Rack Flow Control Assembly) from MTL (Moderate Temperature Loop) to LTL (Low TL) and afterwards re-installed the “Kabin” around the WHC.
 
  Bob Thirsk initialized three Actiwatches, two for ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) and one for CCISS (Cardiovascular &amp; Cerebrovascular Control on Return from ISS), formatted two Holter HiFi CF Cards, and charged four power tool (Makita) batteries in preparation for tomorrow’s start of Ambulatory Monitoring for the ICV and CCISS experiments.
 
  The FE-4 accessed &amp; serviced the OGS (Oxygen Generation System) rack, first removing equipment on its right side, then configuring the OGS equipment for activation by the ground.  After the OGA (Oxygen Generation Assembly) had been powered for 20 minutes, Bob was to reconnect the H<s><sub>2</sub></s> sensor QDs (Quick Disconnects), close the rack door, re-attach the WDS (Water Delivery System) and replace the equipment on the right side.    [After starting the OGA at a processing cycle at the 25% production rate to check offnominal operation (unusual pressure drop), ground controllers moded the unit to 100%.  At this point, the OGA water pump delta pressure approached the FDIR (Failure Detection, Isolation, &amp; Recovery) upper limit shutdown criteria (a problem which has occurred previously) which caused ground controllers to deactivate the unit again.  Specialists will develop a forward plan.] 
 
  In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Thirsk reconfigured the AVCO (Air Volume Closeout) hard dummy panel and soft dummy panel, swapping them to support 17A rack transfer and stowage optimization in the JPM and taking photos of shell heaters and harnesses before soft dummy panel installation.
 
  The FE-4 performed the periodic inspection and cleaning of the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) in the US Lab.
 
  Bob Thirsk also started (later terminated) another 5-hr automatic sampling run, the 21<sup>st</sup>, with the new EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer), also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-4 (Station Support Computer 4) laptop.   [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  Today’s data will again to be compared with VOA and GSC (Grab Sample Container) measurements.  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS hardware.]
 
  In the Soyuz 18S, Padalka performed another health check of the KhSA Cooler/Dehumidifier Assembly’s V1 fan in the DM (Descent Module) by toggling it and the V2 fan on/off and checking air flow.    [On 6/25, a planned replacement of the apparently faulty fan in the Soyuz 18S DM with a new unit proved to be not necessary after Padalka configured a jumper bypass which successfully recovered functionality of the air conditioner fan.  Today’s activity was to check up on the fix.] 
 
  Continuing the extended leak integrity checking of the spare BZh Liquid Unit (#056) for the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator, Gennady charged the unit once again with pressurized N<sub>2</sub> from the BPA Nitrogen Purge Unit (#23) to 1 atm (1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>).  The last test pressurization test to monitor for leakage was on 6/30.    [Objective of the monthly checkout of the BZh, which has been in stowage for about 2 years, is to check for leakage and good water passage through the feed line inside of the BZh (from ZL1 connector to the buffer tank) and to check the response of the Electronics Unit’s micro switches (signaling “Buffer Tank is Empty” &amp; “Buffer Tank is Full”.  During Elektron operation, the inert gas locked up in the BZh has the purpose to prevent dangerous O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> mixing.  A leaking BZh cannot be used.]
 
  Frank DeWinne continued replenishing the Icepacs in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) by inserting two more +4C Icepac belts into MELFI.   [The Icepacs were originally removed as part of 2J/A packing.  Nine additional activities spaced at least 24 hours apart are being planned over the next two weeks, each time inserting two Icepac belts (to prevent temperature increase inside the MELFI.]
 
  The FE-5 also relocated items from the 5MLE stowage bag (at NOD2D5) to new stowage locations.  The empty 5MLE will be used to hold 17A Prepack items planned for MDDK (Middeck) return.   [As per Frank’s report, the 5MLE contained CWC-I (Collapsible Water Container-Iodine) units 2023, 2034, 2003, 2004 &amp; 2006.  A Ziploc bag taped to the PUMP ORU foam box also contains a Pump ORU Filter SV828518-1.]
 
  Roman completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Gennady did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  Mike Barratt completed the third day of his first six-day SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) session, which entails a series of diet intake loggings, body mass measurements and blood &amp; urine samplings in two session blocks.     [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Mike will have to eat special diet (Session 1: High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level and Session 2: Low salt diet).  Solo Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are being logged on sheets stowed in the PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) Consumable Kit in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  SOLO, an ESA/German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device).  Blood samples are taken with the PCBA.  Background:  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
  FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE-5 had their periodic PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Mike at ~1:45pm, Timothy at ~1:20pm, Frank at ~10:00am EDT.
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-4, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-2, FE-3), ARED (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR). 
 
  Later, Bob Thirsk transferred the exercise data files to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  Before sleeptime, Romanenko turned the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> scrubber off, to be restarted later on software upgrade Vers. 7.05.
 
 WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment):   Yesterday, more troubleshooting to investigate the “WHC Check Separator” indicator light annunciation, which included providing additional flow through the unit, cleared the  indication and the unit was returned to nominal operation.  It appears there is an intermittent sensor in the system which will be monitored for analysis.  A review of the two incidents is underway to determine whether they are related.
