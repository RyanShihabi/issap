ISS On-Orbit Status 02/18/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sleep shift in effect:  The ISS crew’s workday began last evening at 4:14pm and ended this morning at 7:14 EST, i.e., 30 min earlier than yesterday (see time table at bottom).
 
 At wake-up last night, FE-4 Kotov did the regular daily “early-morning” check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-4 again inspected the filters this morning before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 In the “morning”, Noguchi, Creamer &amp; Hire completed their first MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air) Body Sample collection session.     [The experiment investigates samples from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crewmembers during pre/in/post flight periods for carrying out a detailed study of these samples, focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in a living environment.  Microbiota of these samples is thought to be strongly reflected by that of the ISS environment, which has a completely closed orbital living space under microgravity.  The Myco experiment is one in a series of studies on exposure biology.   A number of microorganisms have already been detected in space stations such as the Russian Mir and the ISS.  Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. have been dominant fungal species in both of these space stations.  Both act as strong allergens in our living environment, and allergies that are caused by these molds are recognized as a serious problem from the medical point of view. Many researchers are studying the correlation between environmental microbiota and allergic reactions caused by an exposure to a living environment.]
 
 Also at wake-up, CDR Williams, FE-5 Noguchi &amp; FE-6 Creamer completed another Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  A total of 121 RST runs are assigned to Jeff for the duration of his orbital stay.]
 
 Timothy Creamer started another round of the NUTRITION/Repository/Pro K protocol with the 24-hr urine collections and diet logging.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 Maksim Suraev completed a periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 The FE-6 activated the new bioscience experiment ASEPTIC (BTKh-39) in the MRM2 Poisk module, took surface &amp; air samples, followed by sterilizing the equipment, then monitoring the auto shutdown of the evacuation pump, and then taking samples from the transport box and placing them in the thermostat.  The FE-1 took documentary photographs and video of the activities.
 
 With ISS O<sub>2</sub> being replenished from the Shuttle via the ORCA (Oxygen Recharge Compressor Assembly), FE-6 Creamer conducted the standard cycle check, i.e., reading off the number of cycles performed at the ORCA counter and reporting it to MCC-H.
 
 CDR Williams set up the photo equipment to take pictures of the 2A solar array mast.
 
 After relocating ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts) hardware from the Lab P1 &amp; O2 locations (without deactivating the system), William, Creamer, Zamka &amp; Robinson spent several hours with relocating the OGS (Oxygen Generator System), WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), WRS 1 (Water Recovery System 1) and WRS 2 Racks from the Lab to Node-3, installing them in Tranquility, making umbilical connections and running checkouts.
 
 As part of the relocations, FE-5 temporarily removed &amp; stowed the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer) fort WRS2 relocation, then temporarily uninstalled the CEVIS cycle ergometer, removed the four CRABs (CEVIS Rack Attachment Brackets), re-installed CEVIS and replacing the WHC Kabin privacy enclosure.
 
 Noguchi also made sure that the SODF (Station Operation Data File) Procedures Book for the OGS Rack were updated after completion of the transfer and relocation.
 
 In addition, the relocations required a location update of available fireports, and TJ Creamer took care of that task.
 
 Later, Soichi and Terry Virts deactivated &amp; removed the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) from its temporary Lab location and transferred it to its final place at the Cupola, powered it up for a checkout, then deactivated it from the UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) and disconnected its DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) power cable.
 
 Kotov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Suraev completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur),
 
 The FE-1 Suraev also had his 5<sup>th</sup> session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.     [Kotov was available to assist in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
 Oleg continued the extended leak integrity checking of the spare BZh Liquid Unit (#056) for the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator, recharged on 1/16 with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to 1 atm (1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), by conducting the usual pressure check and repressing it to verify the unit’s hermeticity.    [Objective of the monthly checkout of the spare BZh, which has been in stowage since March 2007, is to check for leakage and good water passage through the feed line inside of the BZh (from ZL1 connector to the buffer tank) and to check the response of the Electronics Unit’s micro switches (signaling “Buffer Tank is Empty” &amp; “Buffer Tank is Full”.  During Elektron operation, the inert gas locked up in the BZh has the purpose to prevent dangerous O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> mixing.  A leaking BZh cannot be used.]
 
 Noguchi initiated (later terminated) another 5-hr sampling run (the 70<sup>th</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer).  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.    [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1/2x, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5).
 
 ISS Reboost:   This morning at 2:31am EST, the Shuttle successfully performed the planned reboost of the ISS stack using VCRS (Vernier Reaction Control System) thrusters.  Burn duration was 33min, delta-V 1.3 m/s (4.2 ft/s), with a mean altitude gain of 2.28 km (1.23 nmi).  A second stage reboost is scheduled for 2/20 (Saturday), 4:14am, after Shuttle departure, with an expected delta-V of ~3.5 m/s and burn duration of ~25 min.  Both reboosts will set up proper phasing for 20S landing, 22S launch, and STS 131/19A.
