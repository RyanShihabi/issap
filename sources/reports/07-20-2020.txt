S6 Battery Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #4 Preparations:  Today, the crew continued preparations for the final EVA in the S6 battery upgrade series by performing their equipment lock preps for Extravehicular Activity Mobility Units (EMU) 3004 and 3006.   The crew also completed the EVA tool audit, pre-EVA periodic health status (PHS) exams and installed batteries into the pistol grip tool (PGT). Finally, the crew completed EVA procedure reviews and participated in a pre-EVA procedure review conference.  The EVA will include several getaheads as a result of the crew working ahead of the timeline and completing all battery changeout tasks during last week’s successful EVA. The crew is scheduled to egress the Quest Joint Airlock tomorrow shortly after 6:40 am CT.
