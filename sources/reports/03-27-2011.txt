ISS On-Orbit Status 03/27/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sunday –  Ahead:  Week 3 of Increment 27.
 
Upon wake-up, CDR Kondratyev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 16<sup>th</sup> for them.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
The CDR tightened the BZV quick release screw clamps of the SSVP docking mechanism on the MRM1/FGB StA docking interface, a periodic task.
 
Afterwards, Kondratyev set up the Russian “Shumomer” sound level meter to conduct tests of the equipment, taking sound measurements in two locations in the SM (Service Module) – in the starboard &amp; port QC (Crew Quarters) with doors closed.     [Objective of this activity was a health check of the sound meter and its software, to check for possible deviations against the Russian Operations Data File (RODF), which cannot be duplicated with ground support equipment, to calibrate the Shumomer measuring channel, and to take reference measurements for downloading on the RSE-Med laptop.]
 
Paolo Nespoli &amp; Cady Coleman spent most of their time preparing the HTV2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle) for its unberthing tomorrow.  
 
Cady’s activities involved –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Activation &amp; video documentation of the REBR (Re-Entry Breakup Recorder) payload in the HTV  [REBR is a kind of “black box” for reentry vehicles with a mass of 2 kg and a diameter of about 12 inches, containing GPS, temperature sensors, accelerometers, data recorder &amp; an Iridium modem for taking reentry data and “phoning” them “home”, to be activated just before hatch closure.  A second REBR is to be installed in ATV2 “Johannes Kepler”], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Moving a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop and its power/data cabling from the A/L (Airlock) to the Lab,</li></ul> 
Paolo meanwhile –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Removed any R&amp;MA (Restraint &amp; Mobility Aid), and also the PFE (Portable Fire Extinguisher) &amp; PBA (Portable Breathing Apparatus) from the HTV,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Removed the SD (Smoke Detector) from the HTV, to be used as a spare on ISS,  [since SD removal required turning off the HTV cabin fan by the ground, the crew was to watch for CO<sub>2</sub> symptoms or use portable fans] and</li></ul><?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>After vestibule de-outfitting was complete, set up a camcorder to view the Lab RWS (Robotic Work Station) to provide a live view of RWS monitor #2 during HTV departure tomorrow.
 
Cady &amp; Paolo together –
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Closed the HTV hatch (~10:30am EDT) and installed the Node-2 Nadir CBM CPAs (Common Berthing Mechanism / Controller Panel Assemblies),
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Completed Part 1 of HTV vestibule de-outfitting by taking out the IMV (Intermodular Ventilation) supply jumper &amp; ARS (Atmosphere Revitalization System) jumper, two 1553 data cables and the secondary power cable from HTV, and then 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Partially installed the HTV thermal blankets, leaving the primary power jumper installed until tomorrow.
 
In preparation for STS-134/ULF6, due to arrive on 4/21, FE-6 Coleman set up and configured the laptop for the AMS (Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer) in the Lab and took documentary photography for ground inspection.
 
Paolo Nespoli had another hour reserved for unpacking US cargo delivered in Progress 41P.
 
Dmitri Kondratyev conducted the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness).
 
After spending some time on preparing tools &amp; equipment for the subsequent maintenance activities on the SM ventilation system, Kondratyev one by one removed &amp; replaced 4 frames of the PF1-4 dust collectors as well as the covers of the two lower collectors (PF3 &amp; PF4), discarding the old units.
 
Afterwards, Dmitri replaced the PF1-4 filter cartridges with new spares, discarding the old units and updating the IMS (Inventory Management System).
 
Kondratyev also performed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1].
 
Later, the CDR conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
Dima also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
At ~4:00pm EDT, Cady is scheduled for her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
