ISS On-Orbit Status 10/22/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – Crew off duty.
 
FE-4 Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
The Russian flight engineer also completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 &amp; A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]
 
CDR Mike Fossum, FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa &amp; Sergey Volkov joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the Potok Air Purification System pre-filters in SM &amp; FGB.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection.
 
Furukawa &amp; Fossum filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
Mike &amp; Satoshi also performed their 5<sup>th</sup> session each with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.       [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.        [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Sergey also tended the current experiment with the Russian/German KPT-21 Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall/PK-3+) payload, running in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, by checking the hermeticity of the evacuated EB vacuum chamber after wakeup and before bedtime (any pressure increase above the vacuum should stay within 5 mmHg).        [Main objective of PK-3 is to study wave propagation and dispersion ratio in a dust plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber, at a specified power of HF discharge, pressure, and a varied number of particles.]
 
At ~8:45am EDT, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
At ~10:25am, Sergey Volkov had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
At ~11:25am, Volkov supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking congratulatory greetings to the Science and Research Institute of Long-Range Radio Communication (NIIDAR) at the Moscow Preobrazhensky Outpost on the occasion of their 95<sup>th</sup> anniversary, to be celebrated on 11/16 in Moscow.       [NIIDAR Science and Production Facility is one of the oldest Radio Industry facilities in Russia in the area of design and operation of extremely complex radio systems, design and manufacturing of scientific and engineering products, software products, and industrial engineering products.  Their key science and technology activities are: Designing high performance and high data rate facilities, radio electronic equipment, high information technology, telecommunication, and control systems.]
 
At ~2:15pm, Sergey will conduct a second R-PAO downlink, addressing the participants of the Fifth World Science Forum in Budapest, organized by the Hungarian Academy of Science in partnership with UNESCO, European Commission, ICSU (International Council for Science), and AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science), to be held on 11/17-11/19.           [Topic of the Forum: “The Changing Landscape of Science:  Challenges and Opportunities”.  The forum will focus on world science achievements in the last two years, discussion of strategic areas of scientific development in global community of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and associated political and economic issues.  Nearly two thousand participants representing 48 countries: scientists, politicians, members of international organizations, financial institutions, government agencies involved in science research, will be taking part in the forum.  Reports of the UNESCO General Director, Pál Schmitt, the President of Hungary, József Pálinkás, the President of the Hungarian Academy of Science, representatives of European Commission, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and World Bank, are included in the event agenda.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).
