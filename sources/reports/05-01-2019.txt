Crew Off-Duty:  The crew was off-duty today in preparation for SpaceX (SpX)-17 arrival scheduled on Sunday at 6:00 AM CT. SpX-17 launch is scheduled for Friday, May 3 at 2:11 AM CT. 
Main Bus Switching Unit (MBSU) Status: Following Monday’s MBSU 3 failure, team discussions led to the recommendation to Remove & Replace (R&R) the unit robotically. This morning the Mobile Transporter (MT) was translated from Work Site (WS)3 to WS6 and the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) is currently in the process of unstowing the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) from Mobile Base System (MBS) 2.  Once complete, the Mobile Servicing System (MSS) will be in a good config to replace the failed MBSU 3 on the S0 truss with the spare unit on External Stowage Pallet (ESP) 2 tomorrow morning.
