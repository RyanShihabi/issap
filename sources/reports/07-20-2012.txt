ISS On-Orbit Status 07/20/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Today 43 years ago Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. Congratulations - Neil, Buzz &amp; Mike!
 
Tonight, HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle) Kounoturi-3 will be launched at 10:06:18pm EDT at Tanegashima on an H-IIB rocket.
 
At wakeup, Sergei Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
FE-4 Malenchenko terminated his first experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
FE-3 Acaba began his 2<sup>nd</sup> (FD30) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording his diet input today, Joe will begin the urine collections for pH value on Monday (7/23) and blood sampling on Tuesday (7/24).      [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15<sup>th</sup> day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 &amp; 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
After setting up the necessary equipment, Joe later also was the subject for his 2<sup>nd</sup> session with the periodic 30-min US PHS (Periodic Health Status)/Without Blood Labs exam, with Sunita Williams acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  FE-3 then logged the data and stowed the equipment.  A subjective evaluation was part of the test.    [The assessment used the AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack), stethoscope, oral disposable thermometer and ABPC (Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff) from the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack).  All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.  The PHS exam is guided by special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.]
 
FE-2 Revin conducted his 3<sup>rd</sup> session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.       [CDR Padalka stood by to assist Sergei in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit plus taking documentary photography.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
FE-3 Acaba underwent his 3<sup>rd</sup> session with the U.S. PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol as subject, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on BP (blood pressure) &amp; ECG (electrocardiogram) during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with BP/ECG equipment and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.  Aki Hoshide assisted as Operator/CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  The BP/ECG recordings were later transferred from the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) via USB thumb drive to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for downlink to the ground.        [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.] 
 
Acaba also relocated CWCs (Contingency Water Containers) from Node-2 nadir (D2) hatch to make room in preparation for HTV3 berthing.  Afterwards, Joe unlatched the Node-2 nadir hatch to hardstop.
 
Gennady worked in the Progress M-15M/47P cargo vehicle, disconnecting &amp; taking out the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit, for stowage and recycling in a future vehicle.
 
In preparation for the cargo ship’s undocking on Sunday (7/22; ~4:22pm EDT), CDR Padalka, assisted by FE-4 Malenchenko �C

[During hatch closure, leak checking and initial clamp installation, Russian thrusters as usual were inhibited due to load constraints.]</li></ul>With the RS (Russian Segment) STTS audio comm systems temporarily configured for crew research in the MRM1 Rassvet module, Sergei Revin removed &amp; replaced two SD1-7 light units and their power supplies in the mini research module.  STTS was later reconfigured to nominal.
 
Afterwards, FE-2 performed standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1, downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.       [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.]
 
Joe also deployed new RAMs (Radiation Area Monitors) throughout the ISS.
 
FE-4 Malenchenko had another 2.5 hrs on his schedule for unloading the 31S spacecraft and transferring equipment to the ISS for stowage, guided by the IMS (Inventory Management System) database.
 
Suni Williams took over the RFx (Reversible Figures) experiment payload from Yuri and set it up in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), first adjusting the VCA1 (Video Cameras Assembly 1) for coverage, then connecting the RFx hardware to the ESA MPLT (Multipurpose Payload Laptop), followed  by performance of the science protocol in free-floating position.  Session data were then copied to PCMCIA memory card, and the hardware stowed.      [RFx is an ESA experiment designed to investigate the adaptive nature of the human neuro-vestibular system in the processing of gravitational information related to 3D visual perception. The Reversible Figures (Reversible Figures) investigation involves comparisons of pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight perceptions with regards to ambiguous perspective-reversible figures to assess the influence of micro-G.  The question is whether the perception of ambiguous perspective-reversible figures (figures that can normally be seen in 1g to change in perspective or orientation in two different ways) is affected by micro-G.  A comparison of the perceived reversals during visualization of the figures in crewmembers occurs before, during and after long-term exposure to microgravity.  It is expected that measurable, perceptual differences can expand our understanding of human cognitive-perception dynamics by examining the differences that exist between the micro-G environment of the ISS and that of the Earth’s surface.  The hypothesis that the perceived reversal of 2D figures is not affected in micro-G is to be verified by determining for all phases of the spaceflight: (1) the time for first reversal and the number of perceived reversals of 3D and 2D reversible figures in a given time frame; and (2) the probability for seeing each view/reversal within a figure.]
 
In COL, FE-5 Williams configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring experiment and then began her first session, after preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres with the assistance of Joe Acaba who also took photographs.  At ~7:05am EDT, Sunita observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about her business.          [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist &amp; ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Suni started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment, switching Makita batteries for the Cardiopres as required.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.]
 
With Lab window shutters closed and the CCR (Cupola Crew Restraint) installed at the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation), Joe Acaba &amp; Aki Hoshide performed another grapple training session with the MSS (Mobile Servicing System) ROBoT system for the HTV-3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle) capture and berthing, supported by ground specialist teleconferences at ~7:50am.  Afterwards, the CCR was taken down again, the CUP RWS UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) was disabled and the Lab RWS DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) power was turned off. 
 
FE-6 Hoshide, FE-5 Williams &amp; FE-3 Acaba joined up for another OBT (Onboard Training) session for the HTV-3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3) arrival, today using the ROBoT (Robotics On-board Trainer) simulation program to practice HTV rendezvous tracking &amp; capturing for about 25 minutes, covered by video camcorder for the ground.  The session was followed by an MSS (Mobile Service System) tagup with ground specialists.
 
Hoshide had ~1hr set aside to access and consolidate the Consumables Kit of the VO<sub>2</sub>max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake &amp; Submaximal Estimates of VO<sub>2</sub>max before, during &amp; after long-duration space station missions) experiment, i.e., removing &amp; discarding expired items from the kit and replacing them with fresh items from the VO<sub>2</sub>max resupply kit.
 
FE-3 undertook the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 15 min, a partial fill during which WHC was not available.
 
Acaba also completed his 3<sup>rd</sup> regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.   The video-based proficiency drill today focused on a review of all topics.  At the end, Joe completed a self-assessment questionnaire.  Answers were provided at test conclusion.       [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.]
 
Aki Hoshide completed his 3<sup>rd</sup> session with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.      [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
FE-5 &amp; FE-6 filled out their regular FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop).  It was the first for Aki &amp; Suni.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
FE-4 Malenchenko completed his first collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Yuri also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Gennady took care of the daily IMS maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Sergei completed another 30-min. session for the DZZ-13 (Distantsionnoye zondirovaniye zemli/Remote Sensing of Earth-13) “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining SONY HDV-Z7E camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic and coastal Africa, then copying the images to the RSS-2 laptop
 
At ~12:30pm, Sunita Williams had her post-launch PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
The 31S crew of Malenchenko, Williams &amp; Hoshide had another hour of free time each for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
Suni &amp; Joe had another time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
Before Presleep, FE-3 will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
At ~3:55am EDT, Padalka, Revin &amp; Acaba held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Main Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
At ~4:10am, Gennady, Sergei &amp; Yuri linked up with TsUP-Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
At ~4:50pm, the crew held their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-Houston.
 
Both Suni &amp; Aki retrieved their CEVIS USB sticks from SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop after the ground had uplinked their CEVIS protocol.
 
Williams brushed up on her T2/COLBERT exercise by watching Joe using the machine, while Malenchenko observed Sergei working out on the ARED resistive exerciser.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-4).
