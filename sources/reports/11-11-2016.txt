Group Combustion Leak Check: The crew performed additional Group Combustion Experiment Module (GCEM) troubleshooting today, and completed a leak check of the Gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) supply line and associated Quick Disconnects (QDs). The International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR) valves and QDs for the gas supply line were connected and reconfigured then underwent a five hour leak check of the Combustion Chamber (CC). Ground teams are assessing the data. The Group Combustion investigation tests a theory that fuel sprays change from partial to group combustion as flames spread across a cloud of droplets. In the Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack in the Kibo module, droplets of decane, a component of gasoline or kerosene, are arranged randomly on thin-fiber lattice points, and the flame and droplet positions and temperature distribution are measured as the flame spreads. Microgravity blocks convection, which on Earth would quickly disperse the droplets and combustion products before such measurements could be made.
Oxygen Generation System (OGS) Maintenance:  After running nominally overnight, the Oxygen Generation Assembly (OGA) was put in a safe configuration this morning to allow the crew to inspect the H2 ORU QD.  This inspection was due to the not fully mated configuration the QD remained in after yesterday’s activities.  No water was noted on the QD or tape during the inspection.  The rack was closed and OGS was reactivated and moded to operate at 22% producing approximately 2 kg of Oxygen (O2) per day.
