ISS On-Orbit Status 07/22/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sunday – Crew off duty.  Ahead:  Week 4 of Increment 32 (six-person crew).
 
At wakeup, Yuri Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Upon wakeup, FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Williams &amp; FE-6 Hoshide completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 23<sup>rd</sup> for Joe, the 2<sup>nd</sup> for Suni &amp; Aki.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Acaba had Day 3 of his 2<sup>nd</sup> (FD30) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording his diet input today, Joe broke out the equipment for the associated urine collections for pH value, beginning tomorrow, followed by the blood sampling on Tuesday (7/24).      [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15<sup>th</sup> day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 &amp; 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
FE-6 Hoshide began his first (FD15) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording his diet input today, Akihiko will begin the urine collections for pH value on Wednesday (7/25) and blood sampling on Thursday (7/26).
 
Sergei Revin completed the routine daily &amp; weekly servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.     [This included the weekly collection of the ASU toilet flush counter (SPKU) and water supply (SVO) readings of SM &amp; FGB for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers as required.]
 
Joe closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola &amp; Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows to prevent their contamination from thruster effluents during this afternoon’s Progress 47P undocking (~4:22pm EDT).
 
At ~6:30am, FE-4 Malenchenko conducted his weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-and/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
At ~1:20pm, Acaba powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 1:25pm conducted a ham radio session with participants at the ESA Space Camp in Dublin, Ireland.
 
At ~4:10pm, CDR Padalka will start monitoring the Progress M-15M/47P undocking from the DC1 nadir port, taking photographs of the cargo ship’s SSVP StM docking system interface and its Kurs-NA АО-753А antenna from SM window #7, then manually close the KVD/PEV (Pressure Equalization Valve) between the DC1 “Pirs” module and its nadir docking port vestibule,
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-4). 
 
Tasks listed for Revin &amp; Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A 10-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of Central-Eastern Atlantic and coastal Africa, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">EKON Earth photography of the current flooding conditions in Russia’s Kuban region, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).</li></ul> 
Progress 47P Undocking:   All activities are on schedule for the (first) 47P undock.  In order to perform a KURS-NA test, 47P will undock from ISS at ~4:22pm EDT, redock on 7/23, and undock again on 7/30.
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
