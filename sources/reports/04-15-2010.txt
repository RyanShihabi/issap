ISS On-Orbit Status 04/15/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FD11 (Flight Day 11) of STS-131/19A. Crew sleep shifting in effect – see below.   Happy Birthday, Misha Kornienko and Soichi Noguchi-san!
 
 At wake-up (12:21pm this morning), FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued their current week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s fourth, Tracy’s first, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 In support of the new JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), body samples were collected by FE-5 Noguchi, FE-6 Creamer, MS4 Yamazaki, MS1 Mastracchio &amp; PLT Dutton.     [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson again transferred the VCA-1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) camcorder from the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to the Node-2, mounting it on the zenith “ceiling” for monitoring closeout activities in the MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module)/Node-2 area.    [Afterwards, Tracy returned it to the COL at the end of the crew day and installed on its seat track at the Port Endcone, aft side.]
 
 FE-3 Kornienko terminated the overnight charging for the KPT-2 TTM-2 battery, and then he &amp; FE-1 Skvortsov spent the third 2.5-hr session of the current activity with the Russian BAR experiment (#23/24), taking background environmental parameters in the RS (Russian Segment).  Misha &amp; Sasha used the AU-1 Ultrasound Analyzer, UT2-03 Leak Indicator and Iva-6A Thermal Hygrometer to identify potential condensation areas.  Afterwards, data were downloaded to the RSE1 laptop, log tables filled out for OCA downlink and the equipment restowed.  Sasha Skvortsov later initiated recharge on the Kelvin battery before sleeptime.      [The Iva-6A, TTM-2 and Kelvin-Video probes took air &amp; dew point temperatures in SM (Service Module) sampling areas behind Panels 411, 413 &amp; 415, later behind panels 316 &amp; 317.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  The payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
 FE-6 Creamer worked on the old WPA (Water Processor Assembly) Catalytic Reactor ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) which he had removed from the WRS-1 (Water Recovery System 1) on 4/11, today preparing it for return to Earth on 19A by introducing air into the locked water volume to prevent ORU damage during descent.
 
 Working in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, CDR Kotov removed the damaged seal insert from the ASP Passive Docking Assembly and inserted a new spare in its place in the ASP ring groove, straightening it out with the finger and cleaning the sealing surface with wipes.
 
 Later, Oleg moved into the Soyuz TMA-18/22S spacecraft, docked at the MRM2, to perform a visual inspection of the LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry system and its ROM/read-only memory unit (PZU TA765B) in the spacecraft’s Orbital Module (BO), which Alex Skvortsov had installed on 4/5.
 
 The CDR also upgraded the Kardiomed software application for the Holter ECG (electrocardiogram) monitor on the RSE-Med laptop, used for the Russian MedOps MO-2 protocol of standard 24-hour ECG recording.
 
 FE-6 Timothy Creamer worked on several SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops.  Specifically, TJ –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Performed recovery on the SSC-4 by replacing its HDD (Hard Disk Drive) with an HDD from the old SSC-6 machine before a T61p laptop took its place  [After connection to the ISL (Integrated Station LAN) network, the SSC-4 was to be configured by ground commanding with the latest service packs and then programmed for IWIS (Internal Wireless Instrumentation System) data taking during MPLM unberthing],</li><li>Reconnected the SSC-6 to the network after duplicating the IP address from the previous HDD [The laptop was then reconfigured by the ground],</li><li>Built an Ultrabay Hard Drive for the SSC-5 laptop, to be used for downlinking late inspection LDRI (Laser Dynamic Range Imager) video on FD12, then inserted the Ultrabay Adapter with the 60 GB HDD in place of the old A31p SSC-5 floppy drive [MCC-Houston afterwards formatted the drive, readying it for Orbiter TPS (Thermal protection System video downlinking], and</li><li>Assembled a new SSC-12 laptop, using the stowed HDD, shell and wireless network card of the old SSC-12 machine [The A31p laptop #1080 received HDD #1306 and the wireless network card from SSC-12, then was connected to the air quality monitor USB cable and re-labeled as SSC-12.  The ground then configured the laptop remotely.]</li></ul> 
 Before MPLM deactivation, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson uninstalled six handrails in Leonardo and stowed them at a temporary location in the US Lab.
 
 Working in Node-3 on the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly), FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson &amp; TJ Creamer corrected the malfunctioning UPA T-valve by replacing its failed retaining ring with a new one.     [The original retaining ring was a right-handed coil that allowed for the ring to be “screwed off” when turning the handle counter-clockwise. The new retaining ring is left handed coil to avoid this problem.]
 
 The FE-6 had ~1 hr for replacing old storage compact disks in the CD/DVD Library with new ones for the 19A Stage and stowing the old CDs/DVDs in the CD transfer case for return to Earth.
 
 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson completed her first session with the BISE (Bodies in the Space Environment) experiment, with Soichi Noguchi taking documentary photos of her during the operations.     [The CSA (Canadian Space Agency)-sponsored BISE experiment studies how astronauts perceive Up and Down in microgravity, investigating the relative contributions of internal &amp; external cues to self-orientation during and after micro-G exposure.  BISE data collection must be performed at least one hour after any exercise.  The specific objective of the BISE project is to conduct experiments during long-duration micro-G conditions to better understand how humans first adapt to micro-G and then re-adapt to normal gravity conditions upon return to earth.  This experiment involves comparisons of preflight, flight, and post-flight perceptions and mental imagery, with special reference to spaceflight-related decreases in the vertical component of percepts.  The test involves having subjects view a computer screen through a cylinder that blocks all other visual information. The astronauts are being presented with background images with different orientations relative to their bodies.]
 
 Afterwards, Tracy conducted the visual T+2 Day microbial (bacterial &amp; fungal) analysis of the periodic water samples collected by TJ on 4/13 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Hot and Ambient lines from each port.
 
 FE-2 later unpacked her 19A-delivered IMAK (ISS Medical Accessory Kit, #4014), stowing its contents, including personal medical items, ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack) emergency surgery resupply, AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack) dental pack, surgical supply, and Pallet 2 &amp; Pocket 1 resupply. 
 
 Additionally, Tracy completed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.    [The current card (23-0003C) lists 97 CWCs (2,341.5 L total) for the five types of water now identified on board: 1. technical water (20 CWCs with 759.1 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 432.1 L in 12 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 149.4 L in 4 bags still requiring sample analysis,  2. potable water (9 CWCs with 366.7 L, of which 1 bag with 23.0 L contains Wautersia, 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 4 bags with 170.8 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use,  3. iodinated water (58 CWCs with 1068.7 L),  4. condensate water (8 bags with 122.7 L, including 2 empty ones and 2 CWCs with 43.4 L that are to be used with microbial filter, and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (2 CWCs with 24.3 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 Upgrading the emergency NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia) respirators in the ISS, Caldwell-Dyson replaced the current Fresnel lenses with straight line pattern in all 12 respirators with new Fresnel lenses with circular line pattern.
 
 In the Lab, FE-5 Noguchi continued outfitting of the WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) Rack by hooking up its TCS (Thermal Control System) umbilical line connections.
 
 In the Airlock, Timothy terminated the recharge on the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) batteries.
 
 Oleg Kotov completed the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways. [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 Skvortsov did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Sasha also completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 The CDR performed the functional check of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the docked period.  Afterwards, Kotov copied the data to a USB drive, cleared the archive and downlinked the files.  The hardware was then restarted to continue taking data.     [Data calldown to TsUP/Moscow must be done once a day during joint flight of 19A with the ISS, the file downlink and restart every third day.  IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
 The three Russian station residents, FE-1, FE-3 &amp; CDR, joined up for another 1-hr crew handover period in the RS (Russian Segment).
 
 Sasha, Misha &amp; Tracy again had free time to themselves for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
 The crew completed today’s physical workout regime on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).  
 
 Kornienko set up the video equipment to cover his and Skvortsov’s ARED workout for real-time (live) biomechanical evaluation by ground specialists, and later tore it down for stowage.
 
 At ~3:36am EDT, Mikhail Kornienko had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
 MPLM Unberthing Deferral:   In the morning, the crew egressed the MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) Leonardo and deactivated it, disconnecting all jumpers &amp; ducting, plus reinstalling thermal covers.  However, due to continuing troubleshooting of an anomaly with the CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism) and its CPA (Control Panel Assembly) electronics, vestibule depressurization has been deferred, which did not leave sufficient time in the remaining nominal crew workday for the originally scheduled unberthing of Leonardo.    [All CBM connectors &amp; cabling have been verified and CPA checkouts re-performed.  System data so far look good after one set screw was found to be damaged and a workaround was implemented.  Ground specialists want to analyze the situation before pressing through the MPLM demate procedure.]
 
 NTA R&amp;R Waived:   The decision has been made not to replace the NTA (Nitrogen Tank Assembly) with the stuck GPRV (Gas Pressure Regulating Valve) during the remaining 19A docked period and instead defer the necessary R&amp;R to a Stage EVA (i.e., a spacewalk conducted at a later time by ISS crew).     [Analysis has shown that the current solar Beta angle range provides sufficient heat influx to maintain enough pressure head on the pump, via the PMA (Pump Module Accumulator), normally to be supplied by N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) from the NTA to prevent voids (bubbles) and pump cavitation.]
