ISS On-Orbit Status 05/23/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
&gt;&gt;&gt; SpaceX Falcon 9/Dragon:  According to this morning’s IMMT (ISS Mission Management Team) meeting, “the vehicle is performing nominally and all planned demonstration objectives have been successfully completed to date.  There are currently no known issues that would prevent proceeding with the planned ISS fly-under demonstration, currently scheduled for early tomorrow morning.  During the fly-under, Dragon will briefly approach to within 2.5 km of the ISS to perform another series of demonstration objectives.”&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
After wakeup, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Upon wakeup, FE-5 André Kuipers &amp; FE-6 Don Pettit completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 42<sup>nd</sup> for both.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
FE-1 Gennady Padalka terminated his first experiment session, started last night for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
FE-3 Acaba started Part 1 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the Soyuz 30S crew, i.e., Gennady (#1003), Sergei (#1004) &amp; himself (#1005), for a 24-hr data take.
 
Before breakfast &amp; exercise, FE-1 Padalka &amp; FE-2 Revin each completed a 10-min session with the periodic Russian MedOps test MO-10 "Hematokrit", which measures the red cell count of the blood, with one of them acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer, Russian: “Examiner”).  Sergei then stowed the equipment.  It was the first session for both of them.       [The blood samples were drawn from a finger with a perforator lancet, then centrifuged in two microcapillary tubes in the M-1100 kit's minicentrifuge, and its Hematocrit value was read off the tubes with a magnifying glass.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.  After the exam, the data were saved in the IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).]
 
Afterwards, Gennady completed his first session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.    [Kononenko stood by to assist FE-1 in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit plus taking documentary photography.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
In Node-3, FE-6 Pettit completed the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (Condensate Container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 21 min, a partial fill during which WHC was not available.
 
Acaba, Kuipers &amp; Pettit joined up for a 30-min. computer-based OBT (Onboard Training) review of upcoming SpX Dragon operations on an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop.
 
Afterwards, André &amp; Don engaged in the final 2-hr Free Flyer Rendezvous &amp; Capture drill on the robotics ROBoT simulator, focusing on
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Refreshing rendezvous operations from 30 m through capture,
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Practicing roles &amp; responsibilities for rendezvous and capture,
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Executing the Back-away Cue Card, and
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Practicing good hand controller techniques and successful captures with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System).
 
Sergei Revin meanwhile conducted a 2-hr audit/inventory of Russian SSVP docking &amp; internal transfer systems in the RS (Russian Segment), verifying contents of stowage kits and noting compliance or discrepancies in the uplinked relevant part of the IMS (Inventory Management System) database.
 
Oleg Kononenko performed the periodic task of tightening (re-torqueing) the BZV quick release screw clamps of the SSVP docking mechanism on the MRM1/Soyuz 29S docking interface, on the MRM1 side.
 
For a test of the TBU-V (Universal Biotech Incubator), Oleg set it up in the MRM1 and activated it at +2 degC.  Later, after a temperature check and photography, the CDR reset it to +37 degC, followed about 4.5 hrs later by another temp check plus photography and then hardware deactivation.
 
FE-1 started his first session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2-1 protocol which monitors human cardiovascular performance in the space flight environment.       [After 24 hrs of ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed (CDM) system, Gennady will doff the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads and recorded on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results will then be downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data will be downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]
 
Joe Acaba completed his first session with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.      [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
At ~10:30am EDT, Joe concluded his first (FD14) Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Alternate experiment after exercising on CEVIS to reach 120 bpm heart rate for 10 min, then doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2).    [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.]
 
“Knowledge handover” activities by the Russian crewmembers today included �C
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Conducting the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways, by Oleg, Gennady &amp; Sergei;  [inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)�CRO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)�CRO, PkhO�CDC1, PkhO�CFGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO�CFGB GA, and FGB GA�CNode-1],
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Conducting the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit, by Oleg &amp; Sergei;  [the AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO<sub>2</sub> during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP)], and
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Setting up the A-R water transfer hose with BP pumping equipment and transferred water from Tank 1 of the ATV-3 WDS (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3 Water Delivery System) to a KOV EDV container (#572), by Oleg &amp; Sergei.      [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed for gas/liquid separation, i.e., to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the Elektron’s BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.]
 
André completed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (31-0005C) lists 9 CWCs (36.4 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (no CWCs);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (2 CWCs with 22.4 L; and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
Working in the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), André replaced the GDS (Gas Delivery System)’s tank bottle #1008 and installed tank #1009 instead.  Used equipment will be returned on SpaceX Dragon.
 
FE-6 Pettit re-installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) at Lab bay S3, engaged the snubber pins and locked safety pins to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances).
 
Afterwards, Don enabled power to the Node-3/Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) by connecting the DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) bypass cable to UOP (Utility Outlet Panel).  Next, FE-6 also connected DCP power for the Lab RWS. 
 
Acaba unpacked and organized five new IMAK (ISS Medical Accessory Kit) units delivered on Soyuz 30S, some containing crew personal medical items, and others requiring piece-parting into medical kits.
 
Before Presleep tonight, Kononenko, Kuipers &amp; Pettit will jointly review documentary material explaining the changes made to the Emergency Medical Treatment Pack by Joe during the 30S IMAK unpacking.
 
Sergei Revin completed his first data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
For handover, Joe Acaba observed Don Pettit in the periodic maintenance of the ARED advanced resistive exercise machine, evacuating its cylinder flywheels to reestablish proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.
 
FE-2 completed the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
The CDR took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
30S crewmembers Padalka, Revin &amp; Acaba again had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
Pettit had again a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
At ~9:30am EDT, André had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).  
 
Before Presleep, Pettit will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-1).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day. Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic), with CEVIS (interval) following tomorrow.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] 
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Etosha Pan, Namibia (looking right for this long-term monitoring site.  Last December ISS30 imagery documented water flow into the NW corner of this usually dry lake.  Namibia is an arid country, but rainfall in Angola hundreds of miles to the north, brings water into northernmost Namibia most years. However, this water seldom reaches as far south as Etosha Pan), Santa Barbara Coast, California (looking right for the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER [Long Term Environmental Research].  Coastal zone ecology, including the effects of urbanization on natural vegetation and nearby coastal waters, is the topic of interest.  Shooting a mapping strip along the south-facing coast opposite the Northern Channel Islands, including offshore water color), Volcan Colima, Mexico (near nadir pass over this massive, 3,850-meter volcanic complex in southwestern Mexico.  Detailed images were requested to reveal structure, including possible fault lines, of this twin-peaked volcano), and Tropical Storm “Bud,” Eastern Pacific Ocean, Mexico (DYNAMIC EVENT.   Opportunity to track the life of a hurricane in the next few days.  TS Bud is growing more slowly than originally forecast, and will probably reach full hurricane strength by the time of landfall in southern Mexico).
