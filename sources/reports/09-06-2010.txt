ISS On-Orbit Status 09/06/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Crew rest day – US Labor Day, Canada Labour Day.   Underway: Week 14 of Increment 24.
 
  At wake-up, CDR Alex Skvortsov conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  FE-3 Kornienko’s morning inspection today included the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
  Upon wake-up, Shannon Walker performed a new session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, FE-4 Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker began another week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 4<sup>th</sup> for Doug &amp; Shannon, 8<sup>th</sup> for Tracy, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the standard STTS VHF communications test from Soyuz 23S to the ground, on UKV2 (VHF2) from SM via MRM1 Rassvet.  The test was conducted at ~6:40am EDT over RGS (Russian Ground Site).    [The backup opportunity 2 hrs later (~8:15am) was not required.]
 
  Later, during overflight of RGS-21 at 11:25am-11:35am, Alex Skvortsov conducted a functionality test of the STTS UKV2 radio channel, similar to the check performed on 8/31.   [RGS-21 Djusail (DJS) is located at 45.7N, 63.5E.]
 
  Fyodor completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Wheelock &amp; Walker continued their second six-day SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) sessions, which entails a series of diet intake loggings, body mass measurements and blood &amp; urine samplings in two session blocks.  Doug is now on the High Salt diet, with daily diet log entries, Shannon on Low Salt.
 
  Tracy conducted the T+5 day visual microbial (bacterial &amp; fungal) analysis &amp; data recording of surface samples collected by Shannon on 9/1 on SSK (Surface Sample Kit) slides from the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment).     [The colony growth on the sampling slides is inspected visually after five days of incubation, using a special procedure to analyze the SSK media slides for bacterial &amp; fungal colony growths.  Tomorrow, Doug is scheduled for the T+5 analysis of the 24 nominal samples collected by Tracy on 9/2 in Lab, SM, Node-1, Node-3 &amp; Kibo JPM.]
 
  In the Lab, FE-2 also worked on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), removing the alignment guides to allow activation of the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) by the ground for FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility) operations requiring a micro-G environment,
 
  Mikhail Kornienko was up for the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.
 
  At ~10:05am, Wheels had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR/2x, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after the last T2 session of the day; it is now being done only once a week after the last T2 session.]
