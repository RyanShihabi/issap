ISS On-Orbit Status 11/21/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Flight Day 6 of STS-129/ULF3.
 
 Crew sleep cycle:  Wake 4:00am; Sleep 6:30pm EST.
 
 Mission ULF3’s EVA-2 was completed successfully by EV1 Mike Forman &amp; EV2 Randolph Bresnik in 6h 8m, accomplishing all objectives plus four get-aheads.  Beginning this morning at 9:31am EST, the spacewalk ended at 3:39pm.    [EV1 &amp; EV2 began their “campout” yesterday evening in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, until the recurrence of a false fire alarm from the A/L SD (Smoke Detector) and subsequent SD cleaning to prevent further events resulted in the A/L returning to stack pressure.  After crew wake-up the EVA crew completed their prebreathe protocol via a prescribed exercise regimen.  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-1 began at 9:31am.  Due to the Campout disruption, the EVA was shortened by approximately 30 min.  It lasted 6h 8m).]
 
  During EVA-2, Forman &amp; Bresnik –

  With MS1 Leland Melvin &amp; CDR Charlie Hobaugh operating the Shuttle RMS (Remote Manipulator System) and FE-5 Jeff Williams &amp; Hobaugh on the Canadian SSRMS (Space Station RMS), ELC2, the second of two ExPRESS Logistics Carriers, was lifted out of the Atlantis PLB (Payload Bay) at 6:40am EST and transferred to the ISS (handoff to SSRMS ~7:17am) where FE-2 Stott supervised its installation on the Upper Outboard PAS (Payload Attach System) on the S3 (Starboard Segment 3) of the main truss.  The mating was accomplished at 9:14am.

  As of last night, cargo transfers were 37% complete.
   
  FE-1 Suraev did the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which he had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-1 again inspects the filters tonight at bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  CDR De Winne, FE-2 Stott, FE-4 Thirsk &amp; FE-5 Williams continued the current week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), donning their Actiwatches, from which to log data to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Frank De Winne began the second day of his FD180 session with the NASA/JSC experiment NUTRITION w/Repository, after the 8-hr overnight fast.  This was an all-day session, starting with the usual blood draw and continuing with urine sample collections for both several times until termination tomorrow after 24 hrs.  Bob Thirsk assisted with the blood draw as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).     [After the phlebotomy, Frank’s samples were first allowed to coagulate in the Repository for 20-30 minutes, then spun in the HRF RC (Human Research Facility/Refrigerated Centrifuge) and finally placed in MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  No thruster activity was allowed during the blood drawing.  The RC was later powered off after a temperature reset to limit wear on the compressor, and cleaned. The NUTRITION project is the most comprehensive in-flight study done by NASA to date of human physiologic changes during long-duration space flight.  It includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, nutritional assessments, and hormonal changes, expanding the previous Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) testing in three ways: Addition of in-flight blood &amp; urine collection (made possible by supercold MELFI dewars), normative markers of nutritional assessment, and a return session plus 30-day (R+30) session to allow evaluation of post-flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation.]
 
  FE-3 Romanenko continued outfitting activities in the MRM2 module, i.e.,-
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Installing the BVN Fan &amp; Air      Heater Adapter set, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">Removing protective covers      from the DTG      temperature sensors installed on the three MRM23 hatches (BP).</li> </ul> 
  FE-1 Suraev started a new round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, working in the SM (Service Module) to clean the V1 &amp; V2 fan screens and replace the PF1 &amp; PF2 dust filter cartridges, then moving to the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok) to replace its PS1 &amp; PS2 dust collectors and clean the mesh screen of the central ventilation fan TsV1 and the detachable VT7 fan screens of the three SOTR gas-liquid heat exchangers (GZhT4), plus the fixed GZhT4 grill.
 
  Also in the SM and FGB, Maxim completed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems by cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
 
  Suraev did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  Afterwards, Maxim completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  In the FGB, Romanenko took photographs of a scuffmark on the internal surface of the FGB -Y axis port’s ASP-B Passive Docking Assembly.     [The scuffmark was left by the head of the Soyuz TMA-15 docking assembly probe.  The photography was performed again because the pictures obtained earlier showed only the lower segment of scuff mark on the cone circled by a marker and noted as “ТМА 15”.]
 
  Working with Bob Thirsk &amp; Frank De Winne, Roman performed the usual leak checks of the Sokol spacesuits to be worn by the three crewmembers during their return in Soyuz TMA-15/19S on 12/1, then let the Sokols and their gloves dry out from the leak check pressurizations.
 
  Williams &amp; De Winne cleaned up after their extensive Node-1 Alcove “renovation” and stowed the Node-1 Mod Kit.     [Jeff &amp; Frank were commended by ground controllers on their work performed in the last two days: “You’ve once again stepped up and done an outstanding job preparing Node-1 for the installation of Node-3 in February.  Starting early and working hard, you completed a four-day task in just two days.  We especially appreciated the camera views yesterday, as it was nice to follow along with you from the ground.  Just as a heads-up, there is one small piece of the activity remaining; the connection of the Video/Audio Bus A jumper above the Node- Forward Hatch.  Because this requires closure of the Node 1 forward hatch and the proper positioning of crewmembers relative to their home vehicle, we will timeline this after ULF3 undock.”]
 
  Bob Thirsk had several hours to work on the new APEX (Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit)-Cambium payload, starting out with a procedures review, setting up for historical video recording of operations, then performing the activities.     [Activities included clearing an internal cooling loop air bubble in the ABRS (Advanced Biology Research System), retrieving TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System) spares kit from MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), performing Harvest 1A of both GUS reporter genes plants &amp; GFP reporter gene plants and initiating grow-out for 1A Prime harvest.  This first harvest was time critical since it represents the effects of stress incurred during ascent.  In Part 2, Bob configured MWA work surface area and retrieved ABRS root tray from stowage and APEX-Cambium Replant Kit from MELFI for initiating plant grow-out for Willow plants, followed by the first on-orbit potable water re-supply operation on APEX Willow plants.]
 
  The FE-4 also started (later terminated) another 5-hr automatic sampling run, the 47<sup>th</sup>, with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer), also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-4 (Station Support Computer 4) laptop.     [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  Today’s data will again to be compared with VOA and GSC (Grab Sample Container) measurements.  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
  Frank De Winne uninstalled 10 DOSIS Passive Detector packs plus one Triple Detector pack from COL with new dosimeters, documenting the installation afterwards with two photographs per detector.
 
  The CDR also filled out the regular weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  Roman, Bob &amp; Frank again had an hour set aside for regular crew departure preparations, working on the standard end-of-increment cleanup preparatory to their return to Earth on Soyuz TMA-15/19S.     [It is usual for crewmembers to be granted reduced workdays for making their departure preparations, as their return date approaches.]
 
  The crew performed their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR, FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-3/2x, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), and T2 treadmill (CDR, FE-2, FE-5).
 
  Afterwards, De Winne transferred the exercise data files to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
 False Alarm Recurrence:   False ISS dP/dt (depressurization) alarms sounded again last night, and it is now known that the MRM2 Poisk is triggering the depress response, but the root cause of why or how is still unknown.  The false depressurization alarms caused the ISS ventilation system to shut down, which triggered a false fire alarm due to dust settling in smoke detectors when the IMV (Intermodular Ventilation) went down.  The first night, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) sensors were the culprit, and last night the A/L sensor.  All systems have been returned to nominal configuration.  Shuttle did receive the ISS alarms this time.  RSC-Energia engineers at TsUP-Moscow are working hard on a solution to prevent MRM2 from causing further disruptions, having already sent up inhibits to the three manual alarm commanding for MRM2 (dP/dt, fire &amp; toxic atmosphere) to minimize the possibility for false alarms from MRM2.  The new MRM2 control panel is currently off limits.  During the dP/dt, the US A/L (Airlock) also had a fire indication that terminated O<s><sub>2</sub></s> flow to the PBA (Prebreathe Assembly) masks.  Since it would have taken too long to recover the A/L to continue the Campout at 10.2 psi, it was decided to proceed using the EVA exercise prebreathe protocol for EVA-2 instead. 
 
 WPA Update:   The Water Processing Assembly processed about 26 liters yesterday (FD5).  There is enough potable water to supply ISS needs for the remainder of the docked mission.  WPA automatically shut down as a result of the alarms and there is no plan to activate again until Monday.
