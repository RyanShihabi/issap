ISS On-Orbit Status 10/29/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty.
 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:#444444;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Progress M-10M/42P undocked nominally this morning at 5:04am EDT from the DC1 (Docking Compartment) nadir port after hooks open command at 5:01am.  An automated 15-sec separation burn with DPO-K2 thrusters followed at 5:07am (delta-V 0.67 m/s).  The cargo ship, loaded with trash, performed its 3-min. deorbit burn (99.7 m/s) at 8:10:30am, entered the atmosphere at ~8:48am and burned up at ~8:54am.  Surviving debris impacted in the Pacific Ocean at ~9:00am. </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:#444444;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Meanwhile, Progress M-13M/45P is being readied for tomorrow’s liftoff (see below).</li></ul> 
FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
At wakeup, CDR Fossum checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera &amp; flashlight battery charge and later in the day performed additional checks on the payload, looking for crystals, changing camera battery, downloading images and restarting the Intervalometer for automated flash photography.  The SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM software is not being used for this run.      [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking a photo of the turbid Sample 1 every hour.  While Sample 1 is running, crystal checks on Samples 6-10 will be performed each day.  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.]
 
Mike Fossum, Satoshi Furukawa &amp; Sergey Volkov joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection.
 
After 42P departure, Fossum also opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
As is standard practice after Russian undockings, Sergey took photographs of Progress 42P’s docking interface ring during separation to verify that no rubber seals were missing on the Progress docking interface, and to assess seal integrity.  The JPEG images were downloaded to the RSK1 laptop for subsequent downlink via OCA.     [If a rubber seal is found to be missing, it could be stuck on the SM aft port interface and interfere with the next docking, Progress 45P.  This has happened before, requiring intervention via EVA.]
 
After 42P departure, FE-4 also switched the DC1 nadir port hatch pressure equalization valve (PEV; Russian: KVD) to the Closed position on TsUP/Moscow Go.
 
FE-5 Furukawa powered up the amateur/ham radio stations in the SM which had been turned off to prevent RF (radiofrequency) interference with Progress proximity operations.
 
Also as part of uborka, FE-5 Furukawa used the vacuum cleaner to remove any dust and debris from the vents of the OpsLAN Server T61p SSCs (Station Support Computers) located in Lab bay O1 (LS1 &amp; ISS-SERVER1) to ensure their optimal performance.
 
For his chosen VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) program, Satoshi set up the G1 video camcorder and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), gathered the necessary equipment, then conducted several experiments on List 3 of the JAXA EPO (Education Payload Operation) “Try Zero-G” demo, taking video imagery.  Later, the educational footage was downlinked via MPC HRDL (high-rate data link).
 
Sergey Volkov set up, activated and monitored the TV signal downlink from the SM of the new KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall-3 plus) Telescience payload recorded in the last few days.  The Ku-band OCA downlink of the RS (Russian Segment) video via MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoded stream as usual went from MCC-Houston through the ESA Gateway and COL-CC (Control Center) to TsUP-Moscow.  The transmission was terminated by Sergey about 2h50m later.     [Main objective of PK-3 is to continue previous plasma crystal experiments, aimed at studying features of plasma including the critical points, where the temperature and pressure at which the liquid and gaseous phases of a substance become identical.  Plasma, or collections of charged particles, is the most common state of matter in the universe.  In microgravity, large 3-dimensional plasma crystals can be grown, allowing better observation of their structure and basic processes, which will provide a better understanding of plasma.  Under Earth conditions, gravity “squeezes” the plasma crystal and it becomes 2-D, not 3-D.  Experiments in space aboard the ISS allow researchers to see the real property of the crystals.]
 
Volkov also completed the daily routine servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
At ~8:35am EDT, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
At ~3:36pm, Mike Fossum is scheduled for an amateur/ham radio exchange with the amateur club of Texas A&amp;M University in Aggieland, Texas.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5).
