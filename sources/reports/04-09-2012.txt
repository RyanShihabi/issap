ISS On-Orbit Status 04/09/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Underway:  Week 20 of Increment 30 (six-person crew).
 
After wakeup, FE-4 Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
FE-4 also completed the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
FE-6 Pettit started his workday with Day 4 of his 4<sup>th</sup> (FD120) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  In addition to recording his diet input, Don began the associated 24-hr urine collections and later set up the equipment for the blood sampling which follows tomorrow.       [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15<sup>th</sup> day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 &amp; 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
FE-5 Kuipers began a 5-day program of shooting North Pole aurorae and night views of Japan with the Japanese SSHDTV (Super Sensitive HDTV) from the Node-3/Cupola, today setting the camera up and starting recording for the next 4 hrs with a single focus 4.8mm lens with IR Cut Filter 3 before exchanging the 32GB memory card and continuing shooting.     [Recording is done once a day for the next four days, powered from UOP2 (Utility Outlet Panel 2) in the Cupola.]
 
CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov &amp; FE-2 Ivanishin donned their intravehicular Sokol pressure suits and performed the standard fit-check in their body-contoured Kazbek couches in the TMA-22/28S spacecraft (#232, docked at MRM2), a 20-min job.
 
Later, Anatoly Ivanishin completed his 7<sup>th</sup> session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.    [Shkaplerov stood by to assist Anatoly in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
Several hours after initiating recharge on the GFI-1 battery in the morning, FE-4 Kononenko installed &amp; started the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 for another run, using it to measure UV (ultraviolet) emissions in Earth’s upper atmosphere during global electromagnetic events (2:25pm-2:45pm EDT).   Later, FE-4 dismantled the equipment and dumped the data from Laptop 3 via the RSS1 terminal.       [By means of the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
FE-2 Ivanishin used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 and the freshly charged FSS photo spectrograph battery, taking pictures of targets along the flight track during a 30-minute segment.       [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module.]
 
FE-2 also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Afterwards, Anton took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
André Kuipers performed his 4<sup>th</sup> session with the MedOps psychological evaluation experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.       [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
Working in the Lab on ER-1 (EXPRESS Rack 1), Kuipers performed the 2<sup>nd</sup> data file collection from the NanoRacks Modules which he had installed on 4/4.
 
In support of Don Pettit’s subsequent sessions with the BASS (Burning and Suppression of Solids) experiments, Dan Burbank early in the morning performed visual inspection of the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) facility and activated it.
 
Don later set up the video camera and continued with the BASS experiment by conducting two test points, exchanging samples and burner tubes prior to each test point.  Finally, he performed a fan calibration to evaluate the air flow with the new fan flow constrictor installed, in preparation for the next BASS session, and also exchanged the digital tapes in the MSG VTR1 (Video Tape Recorder 1) &amp; VTR2.        [BASS uses SLICE equipment but burns solid fuel samples instead of gaseous jets.  Each sample will be ignited several times for study.  BASS examines the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity.  It will also guide strategies for extinguishing accidental fires in micro-G.  Results will contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in space and on Earth.]
 
In support of ESA’s EPO (Education Program Operation) MISSION X, André recorded a video announcing the winners of participating teams of the Mission X challenge and giving an encouraging message to all participating teams emphasizing the international collaboration of this project and closure of Mission X 2012.  (Deferred from 3/23).      [Target audience are students (8-12 years old) and their teachers who have participated in the 6-week long international challenge. These are the winners of the European teams as well as outstanding teams from other countries.]
 
Later, Andre performed routine maintenance on the WRS (Water Recovery System) in Node-3, manually transferring urine from an EDV-U container (#969) to the UPA WSTA (Urine Processor Assembly / Waste Storage Tank Assembly) for UPA processing.       [During such transfers, the crewmember always wears protective safety goggles, dust mask and nitrile gloves.]
 
Kuipers then hooked up the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) in the WRS2 rack for the periodic tank backfill with a QD (Quick Disconnect) hose for processing, then closed out the worksite.
 
Oleg Kononenko conducted the periodic (every Monday) verification of the automatic IUS AntiVirus definition update on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2, as well as performed the manual update on the non-network laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the SSCV4 software update.  Before the installation (on 8/8) of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p &amp; RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.]
 
Oleg also reconfigured the REGUL-Packet radiogram channel from REGUL-OS/String 2 to work with String 1, a periodic alternating task.      [Located in the SM, the Regul-OS is a subsystem of the RSUS Radio Control &amp; Comm System of the RS (Russian Segment) for handling two-way voice communication, digital command/program information, and telemetry transmission via Russian RGS (Groundsites).   Regul is the nominal uplink channel for all Russian commands; operating at a low data rate, it is equivalent to the US S-band system.]
 
FE-4 transferred water from the ATV-3 WDS (Water Delivery System) into EDV containers.
 
Pettit &amp; Kuipers had ~1.5 hrs blocked out for reviewing OBT (Onboard Training) material on Free-Flyer Rendezvous, training crew procedures for the SpaceX Dragon cargo vehicle and crew interfaces for monitoring and commanding the Dragon.  Later (~10:05am EDT), Don &amp; Andre were joined by Oleg to conduct an audio teleconference with ground personnel to discuss the procedures. 
 
After initiating LTL (Low Temperature Loop) flow in the A/L (Airlock) for cooling, CDR Burbank undertook regular maintenance work on EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) equipment, today on EMUs #3005 and #3015, configuring the spacesuits for the periodic loop scrub, i.e., setting them up with their SCUs (Service &amp; Cooling Umbilicals) in the EDDAs (EMU Don/Doff Assemblies) after removing EMUs #3010 and #3011.  After cycling both SCOF PPRVs (Secondary Oxygen Package Checkout Fixtures / Positive Pressure Relief Valves), Dan initiated the standard one-hour scrubbing process on the EMU’s &amp; A/L’s cooling water loops, performing a partial dump-and-fill of EMU #3005 and a full dump-and-fill of EMU #3015 feedwater tanks from PWR (Payload Water Reservoirs) #1024 &amp; #1032, filtering ionic and particulate matter (via a 3-micron filter), then reconfiguring the cooling loops and starting the ~2hr biocide (iodination) filtering.       [The activity met the periodic maintenance requirements of the EMUs; no checkout steps were required.  Loop scrubbing, incl. iodination of the LCVGs (Liquid Cooling &amp; Ventilation Garments) for biocidal maintenance, is done to eliminate any biomass and particulate matter that may have accumulated in the loops.]
 
Anton Shkaplerov took data readings from the running Russian BAOK GANK Real-Time Monitoring Analyzer unit for measuring concentration of harmful contaminants in the air of the RS (Russian Segment).     [The BAOK gas analyzer, a subsystem of the SKDS Pressure Control &amp; Atmosphere Monitoring System, determines concentrations of CH<sub>4</sub> (methane), NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia), CO (carbon monoxide), HCN (hydrogen cyanide), HF (hydrofluoric acid) and NO<sub>2</sub> (nitric oxide) from air samples using electrochemical sensors, with measurements displayed on LCD (liquid crystal display) and stored on tapes.]
 
FE-1 also worked with the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for CO (Carbon Monoxide) contamination in the SM, recording the measurements and updating the CO sensor coefficient for calibration.     [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur Dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, Ozone, Acetic Acid, Ammonia, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrous Oxides, Acetone, Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, etc.]
 
Ivanishin completed another 30-min. session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining SONY HDV-Z7E camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Eastern Pacific and off the Chile coastline, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop.
 
Anatoly &amp; Anton joined forces for several hours to gather, transfer &amp; load more trash and discarded equipment on the Progress 46P cargo ship-turned-trash can for disposal..
 
In preparation for Progress M-14M/46P (#414) undocking on 4/19 and Progress M-15M/47P docking on 4/22, FE-1 Shkaplerov &amp; FE-4 Kononenko conducted the standard 40-min. vehicle-to-vehicle TORU test between the SM and the DC1 nadir-docked Progress 46P, closely monitored by ground personnel on DO3 via VHF at 11:24am.  Progress thrusters (DPO) were inhibited and not involved.        [The TORU teleoperator system lets an SM-based crewmember perform the approach &amp; docking of automated Progress vehicles manually in case of failure of the KURS radio-based autopilot.]
 
The CDR prepared for tomorrow’s scheduled IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to replace a failed FCF DCM (FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility / Diagnostic Control Module).  Today, Dan reviewed uplinked procedural material and then gathered &amp; pre-staged the equipment &amp; tools required for the R&amp;R.       [The FCF DCM is the software controller for the CIR HiBMS (High Bit-Depth Multi-Spectral) Imaging Package installed at UML8.  Following this replacement, experimenters can resume science test points.]
 
Burbank had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
At ~8:50am EDT, FE-5 Kuipers conducted a PMC (Private Medical Conference) with the ground to discuss particulars of his physical exercise program.
 
At ~3:30pm, André is scheduled for his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-6).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL. Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2, with T2, ARED+T2, CEVIS, following in the next 3 days.   If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day
