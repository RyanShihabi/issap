ISS On-Orbit Status 04/07/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty.
 
After breakfast, FE-4 Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
FE-6 Pettit had Day 2 of his 4<sup>th</sup> (FD120) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  After recording his diet input today, Don will begin the urine collections for pH value on Monday (4/9) and blood sampling on Tuesday (4/10).       [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15<sup>th</sup> day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 &amp; 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
As generally on Saturdays, the six crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM.     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly &amp; Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the Potok Air Purification System pre-filters in SM &amp; FGB.
 
Oleg also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
CDR Burbank &amp; FE-6 Pettit had an estimated 45 min each blocked out for cleaning up the US A/L (Airlock) in preparation for EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) maintenance activities scheduled on 4/9 (Monday) for Burbank.  Dan &amp; Don unpacked and relocated ATV-3-delivered cargo bags as outlined in an uplinked listing, stowing empties and packing foam in ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) “Edoardo Amaldi”.     [This activity could unfortunately not be scheduled also on Monday for lack of time prior to the necessary EDDA (EMU Don/Doff Assembly) EMU swap.]
 
At ~10:50am EDT, Anton, Anatoly &amp; Oleg supported two Russian PAO TV events via US Ku-band, downlinking messages of greetings &amp; congratulations to the participants of Cosmonautics Day celebrations (April 12), and then answering questions from participants of the international “Ask A Cosmonaut” competition conducted by the International Association of Space Flight Participants and GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center).     [“Hello, how do people become cosmonauts? Where do they need to study? And in general, is it a good idea to be a cosmonaut? Tell us why you love your work. (How much free time do you have? What does it pay?) Also, what are the downsides (hard, dangerous, boring work)? Thank you for your answer.”; “Dear cosmonauts, please tell us if it is difficult to fall asleep in weightlessness. How does weightlessness affect the quality of your sleep? Do you sleep well and do you get enough sleep?”; “Hello from Malance, my village. Can you plant a flower at the station? Do they grow there? Or can you just play? Working all the time is hard! I wish you that none of your stuff gets broken! So long everybody”; “How do you fold clothes in space? Can you use hangers and iron in weightlessness? Do you wash your clothes and how?”; “Question to A. Ivanishin: Hello, dear Anatoly Alexeyevich, I learned that this year you and Anton Nikolayevich Shkaplerov have celebrated your birthdays in space. On behalf of all children at our Birmingham Russian School I say happy birthday to you and wish you good health and space-sized achievements! In our England, on a birthday people usually get a cake and my Russian friends sing a crocodile Gena’s song, something like I wish a birthday happened more than once a year. Did you get a space cake on your birthday? Did your cosmonaut friends sing something for you? And, in general, how do people celebrate their birthdays in space, and what kind of presents do they get? Thanking you in advance for your story.”]
 
FE-1, FE-4 &amp; FE-6 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Anton at ~10:50am, Oleg at ~11:50am, Don at ~1:30pm EDT.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1/2x, FE-2/2x, FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6).        [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL. Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2, with CEVIS, ARED+T2, T2, ARED+T2 &amp; CEVIS, following in the next 5 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]
