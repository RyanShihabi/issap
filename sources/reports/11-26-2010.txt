 Yest posadka!  (We have Landing!)    Welcome back home, Shannon, Wheels &amp; Fyodor!   After 163 days in space (161d docked to ISS), Soyuz TMA-19/23S, carrying Exp-25 crewmembers Fyodor Yurchikhin (Russia), Douglas Wheelock (USA) and Shannon Walker (USA), landed successfully at 11:46pm EST last night (local time: 10:46am today) in central Kazakhstan, about 84 km northeast of the city of Arkalyk.  The crew was in excellent condition.  The descent capsule tipped on its side.  The crew was flown to Kustanai.    [TMA-19 (#229) undocked from the MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet port last evening at 8:23pm, after the crew had performed leak checks of the vestibule area between the MRM1 and the Soyuz spacecraft, of their Sokol suits and of the hatch between the Descent Module (SA) and Orbital Module (BO).   Three minutes after physical undocking, Soyuz performed a 15 sec separation burn.    The actual de-orbit burn of 4 min 24 sec duration came at 10:54:30pm, resulting in a 115.2 m/sec deceleration.  Tri-module separation occurred at 11:20pm.  16 sec after the separation command, software pitched the Instrumentation/Propulsion Module (PAO) in the rear to a specific angle (-78.5 deg from reference axis) which, if the PAO would have remained connected to the SA/Descent Module, would have resulted in enough heating on the connecting truss to melt it, thus ensuring separation.  Atmospheric entry followed at 11:23pm and nominal parachute deployment at 11:31pm.  Following initial “on chute” observation by Russian SAR (Search &amp; Recovery) personnel, the Soyuz vehicle landed at 11:46pm.  The crew was flown by helicopter to Kustanai where Shannon and Wheels boarded the waiting NASA Gulfstream-III airplane which today is bringing the crewmember back to Houston (with 2 refueling stops),- the third direct return for USOS crewmembers.  Fyodor Yurchikhin meanwhile was flown on the GCTC Tu-154 back to Chkalovsky airfield of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center at Zvesdniy Gorodok (Star City).  During their mission, the Exp-24 and -25 crewmembers worked on more than 120 microgravity experiments in human research; biology and biotechnology; physical and materials sciences; technology development; and Earth and space sciences.  They also responded to an emergency shutdown of half of the station's external cooling system and supported three unplanned EVAs by Wheelock &amp; Exp-24 FE Tracy Caldwell-Dyson to replace the faulty pump module that caused the shutdown.  Their efforts restored the station's critical cooling system to full function. Yurchikhin has logged 371 total days in space, Wheelock 178 days and Walker 163 days.]
 
 Remaining on board for Increment 26 are CDR Scott Kelly (USA), FE-1 Alexander (Sasha) Kaleri (Russia) &amp; FE-2 Oleg Skripochka (Russia).  They are having a free day today, getting back on regular wake/sleep cycle tomorrow (Saturday, 11/27).  A new trio of Exp-26/27 flight engineers, NASA Astronaut Catherine Coleman, Russian Cosmonaut Dmitry Kondratyev and Paolo Nespoli of the European Space Agency (ESA), will launch from Baikonur on 12/15.  They will dock with the station and join its crew on 12/17.
