ISS On-Orbit Status 04/22/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
 Progress M-03M/35P successfully undocked from the DC1 Nadir port this noon at 12:32pm EDT after hook opening command at 12:29pm.  35P will free-fly for several days on autonomous mission and is scheduled to re-enter destructively on 4/27 (~2:40pm).    [At ~8:25, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Kibo &amp; Cupola windows, until about 4:30pm tonight (to prevent re-encountering any undissolved plume residuals while orbiting Earth).  ISS attitude control authority was handed over to Russian MCS (Motion Control System) at 10:30am and returned to US MM (Momentum Management) at 1:30pm.  Kotov later switched the DC1-to-Soyuz PEV (Pressure Equalization Valve, Russian: KVD) manually to its Closed position, a standard post-undocking procedure.]
 
 At wake-up, FE-1 Skvortsov terminated his 2<sup>nd</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/SONOKARD, taking the recording device from his SONOKARD sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-MED laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [SONOKARD objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 CDR Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the currently running Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Before breakfast and exercise, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson undertook the Subjective Clinical Evaluation part of her first periodic PHS (Periodic Health Status) examination, assisted by FE-6 Creamer as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  All data were logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.  The blood draw for the PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) was not performed.    [The PHS exam, with PCBA analysis and clinical evaluation, is guided by special software (IFEP, In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC laptop.]
 
 With the video camcorder set up again in the SM (Service Module) for monitoring subsequent activities, FE-1 Skvortsov &amp; FE-3 Kornienko spent much of their workday on Part 3 of the extensive TVIS treadmill IFM (Inflight Maintenance), performing maintenance to restore the exercise machine to full service.  After the IFM, Sasha removed the video setup and its hatch-dragthrough cable.     [The current combined (annual + monthly + weekly) TVIS maintenance tasks are: Inspect belt slats, weld nuts, and blue rollers; tension the tread belt; replace the forward right stabilizer; change out springs in the forward left, aft right and aft left stabilizers; install flywheel case, lubricate the transfer case; inspect gyro wire ropes and pivot spacer movement; inspect/replace corner components; perform monthly/quarterly inspections and cleaning; perform an acoustic survey &amp; speed characterization; perform ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout).  Today’s work steps consisted of changing out the springs in the two aft stabilizers, removing the springs in the aft-right stabilizer and installing 3 new springs in it plus one spring scavenged from the old forward-right stabilizer set (since one new spring was reported to be damaged on 4/20).   Background: The four TVIS stabilizers each contain a linear motor which moves a mass-spring system to provide an equal and opposite force to footfall forces; this serves to stabilize Z-axis &amp; pitch motion of the treadmill to minimize the transmission of loads to the station.  The springs have a limited life-time and can fail due to fatigue.]
 
 Working on the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) Galley fridge, Caldwell-Dyson first reviewed procedural material on the installation of a sensor harness in the unit, then removed all food items from the fridge, wiped it out and installed the harness.    [MERLIN, used for cold storage of crew food and drink, is part of the Cold Stowage Fleet of hardware which includes the MELFI and the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator).]
 
 Tracy then powered up the hardware for the SDRM (SpaceDRUMS/Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix) experiment and turned it off again several hours later, after its data were downlinked.    [SpaceDRUMS suspends a solid or liquid sample using 20 acoustic beam emitters during combustion or heat-based synthesis.  Materials can be produced in microgravity with an unparalleled quality of shape and composition.  SpaceDRUMS will support scientific understanding of processes like combustion synthesis and self-propagating high temperature synthesis and also provide direct commercial benefits from materials processing.  Advanced ceramics, polymer, and colloids can be processed in SpaceDRUMS.]
 
  In support of SpaceDRUMS and its data downlink, Tracy also activated SNFM4 (Serial Network Flow Monitor 4) data capture for LAN-2 (Local Area Network 2) on the ELC5 (EXPRESS Rack 5 Laptop Computer) during the data downlink.
 
 CDR Kotov configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 4<sup>th</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment, supported by ground specialist tagup, was then closed out and the test data downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
 After breakfast, Oleg Kotov also completed his second session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps MO-2 protocol.    [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Oleg doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  On 4/15, Oleg had upgraded the Kardiomed software for the Holter on the RSE-Med.]
 
 After configuring the usual pumping equipment (Compressor-M, hoses, adapters), the CDR initiated the transfer of urine from 3 EDV-U containers to the empty BV1 Rodnik storage tank of Progress M-04M/36P at the SM Aft port, then flushed the lines with disinfectant from an EDV.     [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
 In the US Airlock, FE-5 Noguchi terminated the regeneration of METOX (Metal Oxide) CO<sub>2</sub> absorber canisters #0011 &amp; #0019 initiated yesterday by FE-6 Creamer.

If BD temperature exceeded 50 degC, Elektron had to be turned off.  The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]</li><li>Did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers] and</li><li>Completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).</li></ul>

 Soichi Noguchi worked several hours with the 19A-delivered JAXA experiment NeuroRad (Biological Effects of Space Radiation &amp; Microgravity on Mammalian Cells), retrieving 1G &amp; Micro-G samples from the MELFI-2 and CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) after their desired incubation period has ended, then performing fixation of the samples for preservation and stowing them quickly in the refrigerators.
 
 TJ &amp; Soichi each performed a new session with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.  It was Soichi’s 5<sup>th</sup>, TJ’s 6<sup>th</sup> session.      [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
 Noguchi &amp; Caldwell-Dyson completed the periodic checkout of the HMS RSP (Health Maintenance System Respiratory Support Pack).
 
 Afterwards, Soichi &amp; Tracy also spent ~30 min checking out and familiarizing themselves with the CMRS (Crew Medical Restraint System).    [The board-like CMRS allows strapping down a patient on the board with a harness for medical attention by the CMO (Crew Medical Officer) who is also provided with restraints around the device.  CMRS can be secured to the ISS structure within two minutes to provide a patient restraint surface for performing emergency medical procedures, such as during ACLS (advanced cardiac life support).  It can also be used to transport a patient between the station and the Orbiter middeck.  It isolates the crew and equipment electrically during defibrillations and pacing electrical discharges, accommodates the patient in the supine zero-G positions, provides cervical spine stabilization and can also restrain two CMOs at the same time during their delivery of medical care.]
 
 TJ conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.    [The current card (23-0003D) lists 98 CWCs (2,230.6 L total) for the five types of water now identified on board: 1. technical water (21 CWCs with 709.1 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 432.1 L in 14 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 129.4 L in 4 bags still requiring sample analysis,  2. potable water (9 CWCs with 366.7 L, of which 1 bag with 23.0 L contains Wautersia, 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 4 bags with 170.8 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use,  3. iodinated water (58 CWCs with 997.6 L),  4. condensate water (8 bags with 130.9 L, including 2 empty ones and 2 CWCs with 43.4 L that are to be used with microbial filter, and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (2 CWCs with 26.3 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 In the JPM, Noguchi made connections between ER5 (EXPRESS Rack 5) and ELC5 (ER5 Laptop Computer) with the ELC video cable and A31p video adapter, after spending some time locating the cable.
 
 Afterwards, FE-5 serviced the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) by evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.
 
 Misha Kornienko conducted his second data collection for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.     [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
 Creamer had another ~1.5 hrs set aside for unpacking &amp; stowing 19A cargo.
 
 Immediately before her sleep time, Tracy is scheduled for the PanOptic eye test which requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination performed by TJ as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) with an ophthalmoscope.     [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still &amp; video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula &amp; optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.]
 
 At ~7:35am EDT (8:35pm Japan), FE-5 Noguchi supported a PAO TV event with students at Sagamihara City Hall, Sagamihara, Japan, moderated by the Mayor of Sagamihara, Ms. Miwako Hasegawa. 
 
 For his exercise session on the T2 treadmill, Timothy donned the Glenn treadmill harness with installed transducer instrumentation (second time for him), then activated the harness.     [Afterwards, FE-6 downloaded the harness data (including achieved “body weight”) and filled out a survey questionnaire to complete the SDTO (Station Development Test Objective).]
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-3).   
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Dodoma, Tanzania (some patchy clouds may have been present in the Dodoma region.  Looking right of track to see the city that became the national capital of Tanzania in 1996.  The city presents little contrast with its surroundings, but is located directly to the north of a grouping of small dark hill.  The crew was asked to begin to acquire nadir-viewing mapping frames as they approached, then passed over, the target), Antananarivo, Madagascar (Antananarivo is situated in the center of the island length-wise, and 145 km [90 miles] away from the eastern coast.  The city occupies a commanding position, being built on the summit and slope of a long and narrow rocky ridge, which extends north and south for about 4 km [~2 mi] and rising at its highest point to about 200 m [660 ft] above the extensive rice plain to the west.  It is Madagascar's largest city.  Looking slightly left to see the city), Brasilia, Brazil (some scattered clouds may have been present over the capital city of Brazil.  Brasilia is considered a prime example of 20th century urban planning - it was developed in 1956 and became the capital in 1960.  Looking slightly left of track and taking overlapping nadir-viewing mapping frames, along track, as ISS passed over the urban area), and Ubinas Volcano, Peru (ISS had a near-nadir pass over Peru's most active volcano Ubinas; some clouds may have been present.  The summit caldera contains an ash cone, and debris; avalanche deposits extend 10 km from the SE flank of the volcano.  Overlapping frames of the volcano summit and flanks were requested.  It was recommended to the crew to commence photography as they crossed the Peruvian coastline and to terminate their Ubinas session as they approached Lake Titicaca as the best means of capturing the volcano).
