ISS On-Orbit Status 09/12/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.       Underway:  Week 26 (last week) of Increment 28.
 
FE-4 Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection,
 
Also during regular Daily Morning Inspection, CDR Borisenko conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
At wake-up, FE-5 Furukawa &amp; FE-6 Fossum completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
First thing in post-sleep prior to eating, drinking &amp; brushing teeth, Ron Garan, Satoshi Furukawa &amp; Mike Fossum performed another liquid saliva collection of their first INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 3).  The collections are made every other day for six days.       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
Furukawa &amp; Fossum also undertook their 14<sup>th</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.        [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
Sergei Volkov set up the Russian TEKh-38 VETEROK (“Breeze”) science hardware and then used it to take air ion concentration measurements twice during the day in the MRM1, MRM2 and SM in the middle section and near the transfer hatches of the modules.  Data were taken in two blocks of 1h30m each with a break of ~4 hrs in between and entered on log sheets.      [Objective: to optimize atmospheric gas parameters in MRM1 by operating the Veterok air-cleaning fan for 1.5 hrs without generation of air ions, then for another 1.5 hrs with generation of air ions.  VETEROK uses an air scrubber fan (VOV), air ion concentration meter (IKAR-1) and anemometer-thermometer (TAN-1) for measuring charged particles at various locations near the running VOV.  The experiment studies the implementation of alternative methods for cleaning &amp; revitalizing the atmosphere by pumping the air with an electrostatic fan through an electric filter and saturating the airflow with light air ions of positive and negative polarity, which may solve the problem of removing organic trace contaminants from the air, both in the entire station volume and in the space behind the panels.  Measurements were taken with IKAR-1 and TAN-1 of particle field polarity (plus/minus), concentration, temperature &amp; velocity and downloaded to the RSE-1 laptop.]
 
In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Mike Fossum supported ground-commanded operations on the FSL FCE (Fluids Science Laboratory / Facility Core Element) by gently shaking it several times during the day, grasping it by the FSL handles.       [The FCE itself is locked and is not supposed to move throughout the operation.]
 
Other activities on Fossum’s busy timeline included –
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Starting another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later;  [also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],

After a crew teleconference with the ground on upcoming Marangoni Surface (MS) activities in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Satoshi Furukawa configured the G1 camcorder for ground “over-the-shoulder” monitoring and made preparations for the MS experiments which starts tomorrow.        [Steps included setting up the FPEF (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility) with its MWA (Maintenance Work Area) at JPM F5 with its I/Fs (Interfaces) A &amp; B, and the installation of Handle B on the MS Core, followed by the latter’s installation on the MWA along with the MS Body.  FE-5 then cleaned the inside of the MS Core and exchanged the O-ring surface of the MS cooling disk.  The G1 and MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) downlink was then terminated and the equipment deactivated.]
 
In COL, Furukawa removed SAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System) components from the FSL for relocation, i.e., a cable assembly (EA12303-01) to the MSG rack in the US Lab and the SAMS Seat Track Device with sensors to the ER-3 (EXPRESS Rack 3) in COL.
 
Activities completed by FE-3 Garan included –

Time again for recharging the Motorola Iridium-9505A satellite phones in the Soyuz Descent Modules, - completed by Sasha Samokutyayev for Soyuz TMA-21/26S (#231, docked at MRM2) and by Sergei Volkov for TMA-02M/27S (#702, docked at MRM1), a monthly routine job and the 3<sup>rd</sup> time for Andrey &amp; Sergei.  (Done last time: 8/15).         [After retrieving the phones from their location in the spacecraft Descent Modules (SA, spuskayemyy apparat), the crewmembers initiated the recharge of the lithium-ion batteries, monitoring the process every 10-15 minutes as it took place.  Upon completion, the phones were returned inside their SSSP Iridium kits and stowed back in the SA’s ODF (operational data files) container.  The satphone accompanies returning ISS crews on Soyuz reentry &amp; landing for contingency communications with SAR (Search-and-Rescue) personnel after touchdown (e.g., after an “undershoot” ballistic reentry, as happened during the 15S return).  The Russian-developed procedure for the monthly recharging has been approved jointly by safety officials.  During the procedure, the phone is left in its fire-protective fluoroplastic bag with open flap.  The Iridium 9505A satphone uses the Iridium constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to relay the landed Soyuz capsule's GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates to helicopter-borne recovery crews.  The older Iridium-9505 phones were first put on board Soyuz in August 2003.  The newer 9505A phone, currently in use, delivers 30 hours of standby time and three hours of talk, up from 20 and two hours, respectively, on the older units.]
 
Other activities completed by Sergei Volkov were –

All old parts were trashed for disposal, and the IMS (Inventory Management System) was updated;   [E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid), CrO<sub>3</sub> (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H<sub>2</sub>O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo4">An audit/inventory of a stowage bag with BITS-212 Onboard Telemetry Measurement System components, based on an uplinked list containing 9 items.</li></ul> 
Working from the discretionary Russian “time permitting” task list, Samokutyayev took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Alex also completed the daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
In the FGB, CDR Borisenko used the NIKON D2Xs digital camera to take documentary photographs of the KVD Pressure Equalization Valve (PEV) installation between the PGO (Instrument Cargo Compartment) and the SM SU/PkhO (Transfer Vestibule/Transfer Tunnel), with its cover removed.
 
Afterwards, Andrey started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok).    [Using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush, the CDR cleaned filters and fan grilles of the TsV1 central circulation ventilator and replaced the PS1 &amp; PS2 dust filter cartridges.]
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev made preparations for a microbial air sampling session scheduled tomorrow and later with the MedOps SZM-MO-21 ECOSFERA equipment, initiating charging on the Ecosphere power pack (BP) and readying the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container (at -22 degC) for the samples.      [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger, power supply unit, and incubation tray for Petri dishes, determines microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.]
 
Borisenko &amp; Samokutyayev had several hours for loading equipment on their Soyuz 26S spacecraft preparatory to their departure next Thursday (9/15),- Andrey loading excessed cargo &amp; waste on the BO Orbital Module for disposal, Sasha return items in the SA Descent Module for return to Earth.
 
Andrey, Sasha &amp; Ron again had free time set aside for personal crew departure preparations; these are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
FE-5 closed the protective USOS window shutters in preparation for tomorrow morning’s Soyuz 26S thruster testing.
 
Shortly before sleeptime, Satoshi will also close the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
Before sleeptime, Sergei Volkov will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 4<sup>th</sup> Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
At ~4:55am EDT, Ron Garan had a pre-descent PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, a standard practice before crew returns.
 
Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron turns on the MPC and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Mike will turn MPC off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [Mike Fossum is currently following a special experimental “SPRINT” protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5hrs per day regime and introduces special daily sessions.  No exercise will be timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Mike picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]
 
A task listed for Andrey, Sergei &amp; Sasha on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today continues to be the preparation &amp; downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
