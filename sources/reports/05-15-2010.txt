ISS On-Orbit Status 05/15/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – crew rest day.
 
  At wake-up, CDR Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).   [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  FE-1 Skvortsov did the daily morning check on the TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat container and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
  As part of the crew’s regular morning inspection tour, Skvortsov conducted the routine checkup of circuit breakers &amp; fuses both in the DC1 (Docking Compartment) and in the MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2).    [The monthly checkup in the “Pirs” and “Poisk” modules looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.]
 
  The three Russian crewmembers completed their part of the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the uborka house cleaning, FE-1 conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  FE-3 Kornienko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.,
 
  Preparing the US A/L (Airlock) for the STS-132/ULF-4 spacewalks, FE-5 Noguchi &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson transferred the EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units) from A/L (spacewalkers Reisman, Bowen &amp; Good will use Shuttle spacesuits) and installed LTA (Lower Torso Assembly) restraint straps as required.
 
  Also in the “Quest” A/L –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">FE-6 Creamer started      charging five batteries for the D2Xs cameras to be used for the RPM (R-Bar      Pitch Maneuver) photography activity  [batteries must be charged for at      least three hours. Three batteries will be used for the D2Xs camera      configuration and checkout in preparation for the RPM documentation. The      4th &amp; 5th batteries will be reserved as backup for the actual RPM], and      later</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Readied two BPSMUs      (Battery Powered Speaker Microphone Units, #5244, #5245) for use by the      Shuttle crew during the docked phase with the Orbiter [using two A31p      laptops in the Lab, one BMPSU was placed at the Lab RWS (Robotic      Workstation), the other near the Node-2 Port hatch for MPLM operations.       The long dual drag-through cables will be plugged in at a drag-through QD      assembly at the PMA-2, with one half assigned to the station, the other to      the Shuttle], while</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Caldwell-Dyson removed the      1OA2 panel in the A/L as a get-ahead for the Shuttle-fed O<sub>2</sub>      setup for EVA prebreathe on FD4,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Configured THC IMV      (Temperature &amp; Humidity Control /Intermodular Ventilation) diffusers      in the Lab to optimize air mixing in the Lab for CO<sub>2</sub> removal,      with the additional station occupants on board, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Installed the Node-2 air      duct for increased Shuttle ventilation.</li> </ul>  
  In preparation for tomorrow’s Atlantis docking –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l5 level1 lfo2">TJ Creamer &amp; Oleg      Kotov set up and tested the RS (Russian Segment) video      “scheme” which utilizes TV conversion on a laptop to U.S. NTSC      format and Ku-band of the RS video signal from the SONY HDV camera via      MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder from FGB &amp; SM, in      order to downlink “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN      and Ku-band.    [The associated conversion laptop, an A31p (SSC-1) in      the FGB, on which Oleg will monitor the video stream during the      relocation, was later shut down by the FE-6.],</li> </ul> <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Caldwell-Dyson installed the 5-ft ISA/VAJ (Internal Sampling Adapter / Vacuum Access Jumper) and used it for pressurizing and leak-checking the PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 2), Orbiter Atlantis’ docking port, leaving the equipment connected for PMA-2 leak checking after docking, and
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Noguchi closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) &amp; Cupola windows.
 
  Kotov, Noguchi &amp; Creamer conducted the regular 1-hr procedures review &amp; internal crew conference for the RPM, followed by TJ configuring the two cameras with 400mm (Oleg) &amp; 800mm (TJ) lenses for the RPM picture-taking in the SM.    [During the RPM, the crew will photograph the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Atlantis, to be downlinked for launch debris damage assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers, supported by the Timer (Soichi), and the Shuttle pilot.  Due to an issue (cable interference) with the Shuttle LDRI (Laser Dynamic Range Imager) sensor during today’s Atlantis TPS (Thermal Protection System) inspection, Tracy will also participate in the RPM, pitching in to take photos of the upper surface of the wing’s leading edge.]
 
  Tracy worked on a local-networked SSC (Station Support Computer) to update the all-important OSTPV (Onboard Short-Term Plan Reviewer) application by adding to its “Preferences” file the data for the additional crewmembers due to arrive on STS-132. 
 
  For return to the ground on STS-132 –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">FE-2 collected coolant      samples of the Node-3 ITCS LTL &amp; MTL (Internal Thermal Control System      Low Temperature Loop &amp; Moderate Temperature Loop);</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">TJ collected samples of      the Lab ITCS coolant, using the ISA (ITCS Sampling Adapter) after flushing      the lines;</li> </ul> <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Soichi installed the ISA in the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and retrieved a TCS coolant sample; and
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Also took samples from the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly / Waste Water Tank) after flushing the WPA lines.
 
  Later, Soichi completed the periodic off-loading of the Lab condensate collection tank (loc. D5), first to EDV container #962 for about 25 kg, then to EDV #922, depleting the tank to its neutral point.
 
  CDR, FE-2, FE-3 &amp; FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Soichi at ~4:45am, Oleg at ~6:10am, Misha at ~8:25am, Tracy at ~9:25am EDT.
 
  At ~11:10am, Kotov, Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko engaged in a PAO phone interview via S-band with Ekaterina Beloglazova, Editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos Magazine, and an old friend of ISS cosmonauts.
 
  The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-2, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
