Electromagnetic Levitation (EML) Preparation: Commander (CDR) Swanson and Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Gerst transferred EML cargo from ATV-5 in preparation for EML installation in the European Drawer Rack (EDR) in the Columbus module. Bags were unpacked and EML hardware was temporarily installed. EML installation activities will continue next week. EML aims to increase the performance of metallic/alloy structures through an understanding of how solidification can be controlled and develop a data base of properties to allow better process modeling. The experiment investigates solidification and microstructural evolution and evaluates thermo-physical properties of highly reactive molten metals.
Cygnus Unberth Preparations:  After a successful stay at the ISS, final closeouts of Orb-2 were completed today in preparation for tomorrow’s departure.  The Node 2 Nadir vestibule was configured for demate and then depressurized.  Cygnus is currently being powered by the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).  Cygnus unberth is scheduled for 4:10 am CDT, with release scheduled for 5:40 am CDT. 
Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV)-5 Final Ingress: The last remaining air duct was installed this morning, reverse air flow is in place and all ingress activities are complete. The crew has begun cargo transfer operations.
ISS Reboost:  At 11:58 am CDT today, ISS performed a reboost using the ATV-5 Orbital Control System (OCS) thrusters. The reboost tested ATV reboost execution as well as set up phasing to support 38 Soyuz (38S) landing on September 10 and 40S 4-orbit rendezvous on September 25. Reboosts planned for August 27 and September 18 will finalize the phasing for those events.
