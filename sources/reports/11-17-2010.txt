ISS On-Orbit Status 11/17/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; Today 40 years ago (1970), the Soviet Union landed Lunokhod-1 on the Moon’s Mare Imbrium , the first remote-controlled rover on another world, released by the orbiting Luna-17 spacecraft.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
 At day’s begin, FE-1 Kaleri conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Alex again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 CDR Wheelock continued his current 4-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), his 4<sup>th</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  Later in the day, FE-6 Walker unstowed her own Pro K equipment for her 5<sup>th</sup> session, starting tomorrow morning.       [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 Also at wake-up, FE-2 Skripochka terminated his 4<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.  Before sleeptime tonight, FE-5 Yurchikhin will set up MBI-12 and initiate his 11<sup>th</sup> Sonokard experiment session     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 FE-3 Kelly began another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.      [This was the 2<sup>nd</sup> session with the new GC/DMS unit #1002, after the previous instrument (#1004) was used for approximately 40 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC(Station Support Computer )-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],
 
 In final close-out activities after yesterday’s Orlan EVA-26, Yurchikhin worked at the SM (Service Module) aft port to re-integrate the Progress M-07M 39P cargo ship, docked at the port, with the ISS by –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Conducting a leak check on the SM/39P vestibule,</li><li>Opening the SM/SU &amp; SU/39P hatches and installing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling,</li><li>Deactivating the cargo ship,</li><li>Installing the ventilation/heating air duct, and</li><li>Dismantling the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the SM   [StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB and DC-1].</li> </ul> 
 In the DC1 (Docking Compartment), FE-5 terminated the discharge process on the first 825M3 Orlan battery pack in the ZU-S recharge unit and started it on the second pack.
 
 Also in the DC1, Skripochka spent ~2 hrs with cleanup ops after the spacewalk, prepacking items slated for disposal (filters, BK-10 underwear, socks, gloves, etc.), stowing EVA equipment &amp; tools, and restoring the DC1 communication system to nominal configuration.
 
 Fyodor Yurchikhin had about an hour to begin the stowage process on Soyuz 23S, arranging return cargo in the SA Descent Module for transfer to a representative at the landing site, and trash &amp; other discarded stuff in the BO Orbital Module.      [Note: Departure of 23S with Yurchikhin, Walker &amp; Wheelock has been moved forward to 11/25 from 11/29, to de-conflict landing &amp; recovery operations in Kazakhstan from a high-level Security Conference being held at Astana during the earlier time period.  This schedule change is accelerating most of the ISS crew activities.]
 
 Alex Kaleri relocated three standard Russian TZK-14 Thermal Protection Jackets from RS (Russian Segment) stowage the Soyuz TMA-20/24S spacecraft.  Such jackets are also in the other ship, Soyuz TMA-19/23S.       [These warm coats, always ready for an emergency return in cold climate, are required to protect the crew after a landing Kazakhstan (or Russia) in winter time.] 
 
 CDR Wheelock set up the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) with its software and performed BMM (Body Mass Measurement) activities for himself, without the control/calibration run.  Afterwards, FE-3 Kelly used SLAMMD, followed later by FE-6 Walker who then powered off, disassembled and stowed the equipment.     [SLAMMD, performed first on Expedition 12 in December 2005, provides an accurate means of determining the on-orbit mass of humans spanning the range from the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile Japanese female to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile American male.  The procedure, in accordance with Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law of Motion, finds the mass by dividing force, generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer, by acceleration measured with a precise optical instrument that detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing.  The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.  To calculate their mass, crewmembers wrap their legs around a leg support assembly, align the stomach against a belly pad and either rest the head or chin on a head rest.  For calibration, an 18-lbs. mass is used at different lengths from the pivot point, to simulate different mass values.  Crew mass range is from 90 to 240 lbs.]
 
 Alex Kaleri had 2h 50m reserved for his 5<sup>th</sup> onboard session of the Russian biomedical MBI-15 "Pilot-M"/NEURO signal response experiment, after setting up the workplace and equipment.  Oleg Skripochka provided assistance.  Later, the Pilot-M &amp; Neurolab-2000M gear was disassembled &amp; stowed away, data files were downloaded, and Alex reported to TsUP on his run.     [MBI-15 requires the Multipurpose Hardware Bench as a table, ankle restraint system, eyeball electrodes for an EOG (electrooculogram), and two hand controllers (RUO &amp; RUD) for testing piloting skill in “flying” simulations on a laptop (RSK1) with software (v. 2.0) under stopwatch control, as well as for studying special features of the psychophysiologic response of cosmonauts to the effects of stress factors in flight.]
 
 Working in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Doug Wheelock performed regular service on the JAXA MI IPA (Marangoni Inside / Image Processing Unit) by removing 5 HDs (Hard Disks, #1060, #1061, #1062, #1063, #1064) of the VRU (Video Recording Unit) and replacing them with new disks (#1066, #1067, #1068, #1069, #1070).       [The replaced VRU disks were put in a Ziploc bag for return to SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center/Tsukuba).]
 
 Later, Doug Wheelock &amp; Scott Kelly reviewed briefing material on the major CDRA IFM (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly / Inflight Maintenance) scheduled for them.
 
 In Node-3, Wheels &amp; Scott then removed the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) Kabin enclosure to make room, rotated the A4 rack and removed the CDRA frame from it, stowing it overnight on the rack.  CDR, FE-3 &amp; FE-6 will conclude the IFM tomorrow and reinstall the Kabin.      [The main objective for the IFM is to remove Bed 201 (the “back bed”) of the Node-3 CDRA and stow it for its eventual return to Earth on ULF5.  A replacement for it will be delivered on ULF5, and this week’s activities will leave CDRA in a good configuration for Bed 201 installation in the ULF5 stage.  Today’s removal of Bed 201 took longer than planned; due to the extended time, the also planned removal &amp; replacement of the intermittently failed Selector Valve 103 may have to be deferred.]
 
 For load protection during the Kabin removal &amp; CDRA R&amp;R, Wheels installed the four alignment guides at the T2/COLBERT treadmill; he removed them later for the crew workouts.
 
 Also for the crew’s T2 workouts, Shannon Walker performed the periodic snubber arm inspection, checking the joints of the arm stacks to track the structural integrity of the hardware following exercise sessions.
 
 Scott Kelly had ~30 min for the standard Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) onboard familiarization training, his first, using a NIKON D2Xs digital still camera with 400mm &amp; 800mm lenses and taking practice shots of CEO (Crew Earth Observation) ground features from SM windows #6 or #8, with images having 40-50% overlap and about 20 images in each sequence.  Afterwards, Scott transferred the shots to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for subsequent downlink for ground analysis.     [The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the next Shuttle (STS-133/Discovery/ULF5), to be launched NET 11/30.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Discovery, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
 In the US A/L (Airlock), Kelly initiated recharge on the first batch of previously discharged EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) batteries in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly).
 
 FE-3 then worked in the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), installing an ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) coolant sampling adapter, then drawing an NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia) test sample for return to the ground. 
 
 Afterwards, Scott performed routine maintenance on the CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) units by replacing the battery on the prime unit (#1058) with a new one, then zero-calibrating all instruments.     [CSA-CP is a passive cabin atmosphere monitor that provides quick response capability during a combustion event (fire). Its collected data are stored on a logger. Following zero calibration, the prime unit was re-deployed at the SM Central Post.]
 
 Activities completed by Shannon Walker included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Conducting the regular battery change &amp; re-calibration of the two hand-held CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (CSA-Oxygen) instruments #1041 and #1045, the 10<sup>th</sup> calibration after their delivery on Mission 20A (done last: 10/18),</li><li>Accessing the WRS (Water Recovery System) and reconfiguring the setup for the periodic RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) backfill with a QD (Quick Disconnect) hose, which was then stowed and the RFTA activity closed out,</li><li>Performing the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose   [after the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged],</li><li>Completing the periodic camera setup status check on the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) with Sample 8 (Day 2 activity after initialization), and</li><li>Setting up &amp; readying the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware, including MBS (Mixing Bag System), for her 5<sup>th</sup> session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, integrated with Thermolab, scheduled on 11/19 (Friday).</li></ul> 
 Before sleeptime, Wheelock configures the equipment for his next 24-hour urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol, his 5<sup>th</sup>, starting tomorrow.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood &amp; urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
 After yesterday’s DRY/Dryden &amp; WHI/White Sands tests for VHF (Very High Frequency) comm, at ~3:45pm Wheels will conduct another NASA VHF-1 emergency communications proficiency check, today with the VHF site at Wallops (WAL) (3:51:33pm-3:58:41pm), talking with Houston/Capcom, MSFC/PAYCOM (Payload Operation &amp; Integration Center Communicator), Moscow/GLAVNI (TsUP Capcom), EUROCOM/Munich and JCOM/Tsukuba in the normal fashion via VHF radio from a handheld microphone and any of the USOS ATUs (Audio Terminal Units).     [Purpose of the periodic test is to verify signal reception and link integrity, improve crew proficiency, and ensure minimum required link margin during emergency (no TDRS) and special events (such as a Soyuz relocation).]
 
 FE-1 Alex Kaleri –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Performed another 1-hr refresh of the cabin air with O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) from Progress 39P SRPK tankage,</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors/meters in the various RS hatchways, skipping Soyuz hatches   [inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1],</li><li>Prepared the Russian “Istochnik-M” (source, spring) telemetry reception &amp; recording system (SPR TMI) in the SM for simulation &amp; testing   [SPR enables the ISS to receive telemetry from descending Soyuz spacecraft, to monitor module separation, and record it on the Istochnik-M telemetry system], and</li><li>Completed the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization)   [this is primarily an inspection of the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.]</li></ul> 
 FE-2 Skripochka handled the periodic transfer of condensate water to an RS EDV container for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis into oxygen &amp; (waste) hydrogen.  The designated KOV (condensate water) EDV-ZV container was filled from Progress 40P’s BV2 tankage using the Kolos-5D adapter and an A-R hose.  When filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.      [The ~40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the Elektron’s BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles are detected in the EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.]
 
 Other activities completed by Oleg Skripochka were –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Checking out the samples collected during EVA-26 for the “Test” experiment which obtained four samples from underneath MLI (Multi-Layered Insulation) at two locations: on the SM (large diameter) near the Elektron hydrogen-vent, and on the DC-1   [Purpose: looking for the existence of bio-organisms and FORP (Fuel/Oxidizer Reactive Products) beneath MLI].</li><li>Performing the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers], and</li><li>Taking care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance by updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).</li></ul> 
 At ~10:25am, the Russian crewmembers supported a PAO TV event, downlinking messages of greetings &amp; congratulations to three recipients:  (1) The Kharkov Military Aviation School For Pilots on its 80th Anniversary; [Established in 1933 near Kharkov, the Kharkov Aviation School For Flight Navigators and the Chuguev Aviation School For Fighter Pilots have to date produced over 15,000 fighter pilots, observer pilots, and navigators as Kharkov School graduates],  (2) The Central Marine Design Office Rubin on its 110th Anniversary on 12/22/10  [The Rubin and the Cosmonaut Training Center have forged strong intellectual and friendship ties], and (3) Bauman MSTU on its 180<sup>th</sup> Anniversary  [This year Bauman Moscow State Technical University celebrates its 180<sup>th</sup> anniversary.  The official date of establishment is the July 1, 1830, when the Moscow Handicraft Educational Institution (MHEI), part of the Moscow Foster Home, was dedicated by Tsar Nikolai I.  In 1848, an Engineering Workshop was opened at the Institution.  At this time, the Russian education system started to form, which became very well-known later.  It was a combination of theoretic and practical training of manufacturing skills, unlike handcraft training of the earlier years.  On 11/26/2010, the ceremony dedicated to the 180<sup>th</sup> anniversary will take place in the Big Hall of the Cultural Center of Bauman MSTU.] 
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-6), and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 Russian BVS Computer System:   After the TVM Terminal Computer System on the SM lost the #1 Lane of its redundant three subunits (Lane 2 having dropped out earlier), the TVM was restarted with context data on 11/13, and all three subsets are now up and running nominally.
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Amman, Jordan (the Jordanian capital of about 2 million sprawls over a high, desert plateau just northeast of the Dead Sea.  On this fair-weather, mid-morning pass, the crew was to look near-nadir for this target immediately after noting the sea), Tripoli, Libya (this capital city of 1.69 million has been occupied since its founding in the 7th century BC.  It lies on a gentle bulge in the Libyan coastline.  As ISS approached the Mediterranean coast from the SW at mid-morning, the crew could find this low-contrast target just left of track under fair skies), and Domingo, Dominican Republic (the capital city of the Dominican Republic with a population of 2.2 million lies on the south coast of the large Caribbean island of Hispaniola.  ISS is at mid-morning with partly cloudy conditions expected.  As the station approached from the SW, the crew was to look just left of track for Santo Domingo).
