ISS On-Orbit Status 10/03/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – first full day for the current 9 ISS occupants: 
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>6 Expedition-21 members: CDR Frank DeWinne (Belgium), FE-1 Maxim Suraev (Russia), FE-2 Nicole Stott (USA), FE-3 Roman Romanenko (Russia), FE-4 Robert Thirsk (Canada), FE-5 (future CDR) Jeff Williams (USA) –  plus
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>3 to depart in a week: CDR Gennady Padalka (Russia), FE-1 Michael Barratt (USA), SFP Guy Laliberté (Canada).  
 With wake-up at 3:00am EDT (sleeptime 5:30pm), the crew had a 1-hr shorter workday.
 
  Barratt, Stott, Thirsk, De Winne &amp; Williams performed their first INTEGRATED IMMUNE liquid saliva collection, starting right after wake-up.  Collections are performed every other day, with the final one on the morning of the blood draw, and the samples are stored at ambient temperature.     [Along with NUTRITION (Nutritional Status Assessment), INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmember soak a piece of cotton inside their mouth and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
  
  Gennady Padalka, Nicole Stott &amp; Mike Barratt undertook the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement, using the IM mass measurement device, which the CDR had set up and then stowed away.    [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IM "scales" measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed.]
  
  Jeff Williams began his first week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), donning his Actiwatch, from which to log data to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
  
  FE-3 Romanenko conducted the periodic status checks on the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment in the SM (Service Module), including recharging the water tank as required.    [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-16 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP), currently planted with Mizuna seeds.  Mizuna (Brassica rapa nipposinica) is a tasty variety of Japanese mustard greens, also known as California Peppergrass, eaten as a salad.] 
  
  FE-4 Bob Thirsk worked with Romanenko in the U.S. &amp; Kibo Labs to initiate, deploy &amp; photograph 8 Matryoshka SBDs (Space Bubble Detectors) for a (RaDI-N Radiation Dosimetry inside ISS) payload session, measuring neutron flux.    [The SBDs are also part of the Russian RBO-3-2 Matryoshka payload.]
 
  Suraev &amp; Padalka closed out Soyuz 20S activities by –

  With the departure of TMA-14/18S coming up in a week, Padalka switched the antenna feeder cables of the KURS-P from SM +Y port to SM –Y port, to support DC-1 ops.    [KURS is the automated radar approach &amp; docking system on the Russian Soyuz &amp; Progress vehicles, with the active (KURS-A) component in the visiting vehicles and the passive transponder/repeater-type KURS-P component in the SM.]
 
  Roman &amp; Maxim serviced newly arrived Russian science payloads in the SM such as –

  Romanenko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  FE-3 also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  Nicole Stott set up the photographic equipment for another (final) session of the Moon photography required by the JAXA EPO (Educational Programs Operation) “ISS Moon Score” and afterwards conducted the shooting at pre-set time.     [The purpose of this JAXA EPO is to create a musical score using Moon photos taken from the “Kibo” JEM and DC-1 windows at different times in the lunar cycle while the crew is floating naturally under microgravity environment.  Five of the seven sessions required for each different Moon age were taken by Greg Chamitoff and Koichi Wakata, the remainder by Tim Kopra.  At least 80 photos were necessary from DC-1 no. 2 window with the 400mm lens, and at least 80 photos of the Moon with atmospheric layer and/or JEF (JEM External Facility) are desirable from JEM window #F8 with the 200mm lens.]
 
  FE-5 De Winne first executed the SNFM (Serial Network Flow Monitor) application on ELC1 (EXPRESS Rack 1  Laptop Computer) for capturing LAN-2 ER-3 (EXPRESS Rack 3) data using the ELC-3 (ER-3 Laptop) preparatory to HRF Rack 1 data downlink.
 
  Then, Frank worked with POIC (Payload Operation &amp; Integration Center/Huntsville), setting up &amp; checking out the new PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware, manually subsystem by subsystem.  Afterwards, PPFS was dismantled &amp; stowed.     [Video/data coverage for POIC was via Ku-band, including the final verification of ECG (Electrocardiogram) transmittal.  If successful, the checkout prepares researchers for next week’s medical VO2Max (max volume oxygen) activities.]
  
  In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), De Winne conducted the first (FD4) photo session (of 3) on the B2 YNG Yeast EC (Experiment Container) in the BLB (Biolab) incubator.
  
  The CDR completed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems in the SM and FGB by cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
  
  Gennady also conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.
  
  Mike Barratt &amp; Jeff Williams had ~3h15m reserved for joint handover activities in which the departing FE-1 familiarized the new FE-5 with daily duties &amp; operations.
  
  Later, Jeff assisted SFP Laliberté with a scheduled live video shoot, downlinked to Cirque du Soleil, with the CdS producer located in MCC-Houston.     [These assistances to Guy by non-Russian crewmembers (Williams, De Winne or Thirsk) are formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and Cirque du Soleil/Laliberté.]
 
  Nicole &amp; Bob had ~3 hrs set aside for continuing cargo transfers from the HST (H-II Transfer Vehicle) to the ISS and trash in the reverse direction, followed by a 15-min debriefing/bookkeeping tagup with ground specialists.
  
  Williams &amp; Suraev each had an hour reserved for themselves for general orientation (station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
  
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-2), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).
 
  Later, Stott transferred the exercise data files to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  At ~1:55pm, Bob powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at ~2:00pm conducted a ham radio session with a group of Boys Scouts of Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.
