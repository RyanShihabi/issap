Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations:  Kelly and Lindgren prepared for Friday’s EVA by reviewing Fluid Quick Disconnect (QD) training material, auditing and configuring EVA tools, and making changes to the ISS EVA Systems Checklist book and Cuff Checklist procedures.  Additionally, they installed Rechargeable EVA Battery Assemblies (REBA) on Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) suits 3003 and 3010. Once installed, a checkout was performed to verify the glove heaters are functional and helmet cameras are receiving power.  Hatch opening for Friday’s P6 Return To Original Configuration (RTOC) EVA is scheduled for 6:15am CST.
 
Capillary Flow Experiment-2 (CFE-2):  Yui set up and initiated a handheld CFE-2 Vane Gap 1 experiment. Because liquids behave differently in space than they do on Earth, containers that can process, hold or transport them must be designed to work in microgravity. The CFE-2 furthers research into the control of liquid behavior aboard spacecraft through wetting and container geometry. Vane Gap experiments identify the critical geometric wetting conditions of a vane structure that does not quite meet the container wall – a construct used in various fluid systems aboard spacecraft such as fuel tanks, thermal systems and water processors for life support.  The results of these tests may be used to improve the capability to quickly and accurately predict how related processes such as passive separation of gases from liquids in the absence of gravity occur.
 
Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Status:  Yesterday afternoon, Yui performed routine maintenance on the WHC by preparing a new recycle tank for installation then performing a tank R&R.  Upon WHC activation, the crew observed irregular behavior associated with the Bad Pretreat Quality Light. The WHC has since been configured to store urine via internal tank (EDV). Ground teams are assessing a troubleshooting plan.
