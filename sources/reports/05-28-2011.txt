First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking &amp; brushing teeth, FE-3 Ron Garan began his 4<sup>th</sup> saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 4), today collecting dry saliva samples five times in the course of the day.        [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
Also at wake-up, Garan undertook another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, his 13<sup>th</sup>.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
In support of the JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), body samples were collected in the morning by Ron Garan from PLT Gregory Johnson and himself, then inserted into the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezer for preservation.      [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss.]
 
CDR Borisenko &amp; FE-1 Samokutyayev joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of the uborka house cleaning, Andrey &amp; Aleksandr completed regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM (Service Module).
 
Later, the CDR conducted the daily monitoring of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM which is taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle docked phase.  The data were later copied from the BUSD Control &amp; Data Gathering Unit to a USB-D-M-3 stick for downlink to the ground.  The BUSD archive was then deleted and the DAKON-M restarted.      [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
Borisenko also conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways to see how the ventilation/circulation system is coping with the 9-person crew.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
In a somewhat unusual twist of timelines, Shuttle crewmembers MS4 Chamitoff &amp; MS1 Fincke performed major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) in the ISS by working in Node-3 on restoring the CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly) to full service.      [After Ron Garan had removed the failed Desiccant/Sorbent Bed 2 from the rear of the CDRA rack at Bay A4 on 5/24, Spanky &amp; Taz had a hard time today completing the installation of the new Bed 201 frame delivered on ULF6 due to fit check problems.  The installation took longer than anticipated but was completed.  Work continues and is expected to be finished to allow the Shuttle reboost and undocking remain on schedule as planned.  Interesting: a Shuttle crew doing an ISS installation of a Russian component.]
 
FE-3 Garan meanwhile worked with CDR Mark Kelly &amp; MS3 Andrew Feustel on post-EVA EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) reconfiguration and tools &amp; hardware transfers.     [EMUs 3005 &amp; 3011 stay on ISS (3011 was moved from the PMM/Permanent Multipurpose Module to the U.S. Airlock).  EMUs 3004 &amp; 3018 were reconfigured for return to Earth.]
 
Afterwards, Ron swapped the GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) freezers, disconnecting the sample-loaded Descent GLACIER on the ISS and exchanging it for the Ascent GLACIER with Roberto Vittori, photographed by Box Johnson.      [Power interrupts had to be limited to 30 min for the -35 degC unit and limited to 120 min for the ‑95 degC unit during transfer.]
 
Roberto &amp; Drew also worked several hours on Middeck Transfers between Shuttle &amp; ISS.
 
Other activities completed by Ron Garan included –

Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes, [the current card (27-0014H) lists 113 CWCs (2,169.7 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (10 CWCs with 392.0 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 87.0 L in 3 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (91 CWCs with 1,668.3 L for reserve (also 14 expired bags with 251.5 L);  4. condensate water (76.6 L in 5 bags, plus 5 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (32.8 L in 2 CWCs from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Completing periodic maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), inspecting the exercise rope knot for fraying or damage in rope or rope strands as well as the periodic evacuation of its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.      [Knot can be loosened as needed to aid in the inspection.  Areas of concern are those with the tightest diameters (i.e. sections of rope contacting the French Clip).  If damage is found, Ron was to photo document it and notify MCC-Houston.]</li></ul> 
Sasha conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Andrey powered up the amateur/ham radio equipment in the SM.
 
At ~1:00am EDT, after Borisenko had powered up the amateur/ham equipment in the SM Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply), he &amp; Samokutyayev used it  for a ham radio session with students at the International Children’s Creative Film &amp; Video Festival “St. Petersburg Movie Screen” in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
 
At ~10:16am, Garan, Kelly &amp; Johnson supported an educational PAO/TV downlink, fielding questions from students at a Tucson Civic Event at the University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.     [In attendance on the ground were Michael J.
