Trailing Thermal Control Radiator (TTCR) Extravehicular Activity (EVA): Today, CDR Williams and FE-6 Rubins completed the TTCR EVA, with Airlock egress at 6:53 am CDT. Once outside the Airlock, the crew performed the following scheduled tasks:

Retract, cover, and cinch down the TTCR using hook straps
Replace a failed External Television Camera Group (ETVCG) light at the Camera Port 9 (CP9) location
Install a High Definition Camera in the CP9 location
Re-torque the Alpha Joint Interface Structure (AJIS) Struts on the Port 4 (P4) truss
Perform an inspection Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ)
Port 6 (P6) Pump Flow and Control System (PFCS) Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI) Tie-back

The crew was ahead on the timeline, so they were also able to install an additional High Definition Camera at the CP8 location, and perform the Port Crew and Equipment Translation Aid (CETA) Cart Brake Handle Tie-Down task. While Williams and Rubin were outside, FE-5 Onishi operated the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) and assisted with the tasks. The EVA duration was 6 hours, 48 minutes.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations for EVA:  Today Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS to support the TTCR EVA.  Once the EVA crew completed the TTCR retract, FE-5 maneuvered the SSRMS into position to install an Articulating Portable Foot Restraint (APFR) on the SSRMS Latching End Effector (LEE). CDR ingressed the APFR, and the SSRMS was maneuvered to allow CDR to change the light of the CP9 (P1 Lower Outboard (LOOB)) camera then again to position CDR to install an External High Definition Camera (EHDC) on the CP9 camera.  Once the CP9 tasks had been completed, the SSRMS was maneuvered to position CDR to install an EHDC on the CP8 (P1 Upper Outboard (UPOB)) camera.  Once this had been completed, the SSRMS was moved to a park position. MSS performance today was nominal.
