ISS On-Orbit Status 05/22/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FD9 (Flight Day 9) of STS-132/ULF-4.   Saturday.  Duty-off for Shuttle crew.
 
 ISS Crew Wake – 1:20am EDT
 ISS Crew Sleep – 4:20pm
 
  At ~5:00am-6:00am EDT, with Piers Sellers &amp; Garrett Reisman operating the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System), the ICC-VLD2 (Integrated Cargo Carrier – Vertical Light Deployable 2, carrying the six old P6 batteries, was successfully transferred to the Shuttle payload bay and berthed securely for return.
 
  At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  FE-1 Skvortsov did the daily morning check on the TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat container and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
  CDR Kotov had 2h50m reserved for undertaking his 5<sup>th</sup> onboard session with the Russian biomedical MBI-15 "Pilot-M"/NEURO signal response experiment after setting up the workplace and equipment.  Kornienko assisted as Operator and took documentary photography.   Later, the Pilot-M &amp; Neurolab-2000M gear was disassembled &amp; stowed away, and Oleg reported on his run to TsUP-Moscow.    [MBI-15 requires the Multipurpose Hardware Bench as a table, ankle restraint system, eyeball electrodes for an EOG (electrooculogram), and two hand controllers (RUO &amp; RUD) for testing piloting skill in “flying” simulations on a laptop (RSK1) with software (v. 2.0) under stopwatch control, as well as for studying special features of the psychophysiologic response of cosmonauts to the effects of stress factors in flight.]
 
  In support of the JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), body samples were collected by FE-2 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson from CDR Ken Ham, MS-1 Garrett Reisman and herself and then inserted for preservation into MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) at +2 degC.     [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss.]
 
  FE-6 Creamer took on the task of setting up the Shuttle-delivered Spinal Elongation experiment with its Spinal TAP (Tracking Anthropometric Posture Assembly) and other equipment assemblies on the Shuttle Commander’s seat.  Data were later collected by Creamer, Caldwell-Dyson &amp; Soichi Noguchi of all subjects, measuring both standing &amp; seated height.  TJ then stowed the hardware.     [Changes in seated height due to spinal growth are being assessed based on measurement with an anthropometer (instrument for measuring the human trunk and limbs) as well as scaling of objects of known sizes in photographs of seated crewmembers.  These methodologies, which have been tested in the laboratory and the Space Shuttle cockpit trainer, were selected as the most accurate means available during flight.  Measurements will be taken at pre-defined intervals during flight for each crewmember.  The “Spinal Elongation and its Effects on Seated Height in a Microgravity Environment (Spinal Elongation)” investigation provides quantitative data about the amount of change that occurs in the seated height due to spinal elongation in space.  Spinal elongation has been observed to occur in crewmembers during space flight, but has only previously been recorded in the standing position.  The seated height data in micro-G is considered necessary to correctly identify the seated height projections of the crew in the Orion configuration.  The projections of seated height provides data on the proper positioning of the seats within the vehicle, adequate clearance for seat stroke in high acceleration impacts, fit in seats, correct placements of seats with respect to each other and the vehicle and the proper orientation to displays and controls. Additionally, data concerning the effects of spinal elongation on seated height would aid in the design of suit components, habitation requirements and tool specifications of future long-duration space expeditions.]
 
 
  Preparatory to tomorrow’s Atlantis undocking, Noguchi reconfigured the O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) transfer equipment from its pre-breathing configuration and initiated the pump-over of gaseous O<sub>2</sub> from the Shuttle to the ISS HPGT (High Pressure Gas Tank) on the outside of the A/L (Airlock).      [MCC-Houston performed the necessary reconfiguration of the A/L CCAA (Common Cabin Air Assembly).  Transfer of a total of 73 lbs of O<sub>2</sub> has been approved.] 
 
  Later, Soichi terminated N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) transfer from Atlantis to the ISS.
 
  For viewing the transfer of the ICC by SSRMS, FE-5 Noguchi configured and activated the VWS/SSC (Video Streaming Workstation/Station Support Computer) laptops for video from the Kibo JRMS (JEM Robotic Manipulator System) cameras via US Ku-band assets.    [After the berthing, Soichi took the VWS video system down again.]
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson disconnected the DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) bypass cable at both Lab &amp; Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) to preserve the DCP monitors’ life.
 
  Tracy also removed the VDS (Video Distribution System) video cap in Node-2 , cutting off video from Atlantis and enabling the Node-2 camcorder during crew sleep.
 
  Continuing the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, FE-1 Skvortsov worked first in the MRM2 Poisk module, then in the DC1 Pirs Docking Compartment, using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush to clean the V1 &amp; V2 fan mesh grilles, replacing the PF1 &amp; PF2 dust filters in DC1 and cleaning them in MRM2.  The removed units were discarded and the IMS (Inventory Management System) updated accordingly.
 
  Later, Alexander went on to the SM to inspect &amp; clean Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  Sasha also conducted the regular status check of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment hardware for taking structural dynamics data during the docked period.     [Data calldown to TsUP must be done once a day during joint flight of ULF-4 with the ISS, the file downlink and restart every third day.  IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
  Caldwell-Dyson took care of the (currently frequent) offloading of the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) from WRS (Water Recovery System) Rack 1 into a CWC-I (Collapsible Water Container-Iodine) with the common H<sub>2</sub>O transfer hose (which took about 23 min) from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary Port, then flushed the system.
 
  Later, Tracy spent some time in the A/L restowing EVA tools from the ULF-4 spacewalks.
 
  FE-6 Creamer reconfigured the EVA D2Xs cameras for nominal operation.
 
  After reviewing sample transfer &amp; stowage procedures, Creamer transferred accumulated ULF-4 bioscience samples from the ISS MELFI to the Shuttle GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator), then locked its door securely.   [Transferred samples included JAXA MyoLab (Molecular Mechanism of Microgravity-Induced Skeletal Muscle Atrophy - Physiological Relevance of Cbl-b Ubiquitin Ligase), JAXA NeuroRad, JAXA Fish Scales, JAXA Hair, and HRP (Human Research Program) Blood.]
 
  Kornienko &amp; Skvortsov spent several hours on cargo transfer from the newly arrived MRM1 module to the ISS, and then Mikhail installed a VD1 air duct between Rassvet and FGB for ventilation.
 
  Meanwhile, CDR Kotov continued transferring cargo to the Soyuz 21S spacecraft for stowage in the Orbital Module (trash) or Descent Module (return cargo).
 
  In the SM, Sasha performed a close inspection of the TVIS treadmill and its immediate surroundings, looking for potential FOD (Foreign Object Debris).    [Crew Note downlink:  “I did not find the FOD – everything was OK.]
 
  FE-3 conducted the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1. This checkup is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently twelve persons.]
 
  Kornienko also performed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems in the SM &amp; FGB, cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
 
  Later, Misha initiated recharging the battery of the KPT-2 Piren instrument after yesterday’s KPT-2 BAR run.   [Piren-B, a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, is part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Besides Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
  All crewmembers participated in the Russian Simvolika activity, preparing the traditional commemorative (“symbolic”) items, today continuing to stamp and sign 100 envelopes with the image of MRM1 while being auto-recorded on video.  The activity included shooting a group picture of the ISS-23 crew with envelopes in their hands.  The envelopes were then stowed in 21S for return.
 
  TJ &amp; Soichi again had ~60 min set aside for regular crew departure preparations, working on the standard end-of-increment cleanup preparatory to their return.     [It is usual for crewmembers to be granted reduced workdays for making their departure preparations, as their return date approaches.]
 
  FE-2 &amp; FE-3 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Misha at ~1:10pm, Tracy at ~3:40pm EDT.
 
  The ISS crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the TVIS treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).
 
  At ~7:40am EDT, Tracy Caldwell-Dyson and the Atlantis crew participated in a PAO Education Event with NASA Explorer Schools answering questions from students across the country.
