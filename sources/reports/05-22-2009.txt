ISS On-Orbit Status 05/22/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
  FE-1 Barratt continued his second run of sleep logging for the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a week-long session.  This is similar to Barratt’s BCD (Baseline Data Collection) which was performed pre-flight for comparison.    [To monitor the crewmember’s sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, Mike wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as his patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and uses the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  CDR Padalka performed the frequent status check on the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment, verifying proper operation of the BU Control Unit and MIS-LADA Module fans (testing their air flow by hand).   [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-15 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]
 
  In further support for JEM RMS (Robotic Manipulator System) activation &amp; software checkout in the Kibo Lab, FE-2 Wakata reconfigured the BDS (Backup Drive System) for Checkout #2 by powering up the RLT (Robotics Laptop Terminal) and BUC (Backup Controller), then checking out the new software on the two computers.  For the subsequent cleanup, Wakata reconnected the MPC (Main Processing Controller) to its UOP (Utility Outlet Panel), powered off the BUC &amp; RLT and reconfigured their connections for RMS ops.
 
  Koichi also worked on the OGS (Oxygen Generator System) in the Lab, first clearing access to the OGS rack by removing equipment from its right side, then configuring the OGS equipment for activation by the ground, including connecting the H<sub>2</sub> sensor’s oxygen QDs (Quick Disconnects).  Afterwards, the equipment was replaced at its stowage location.
 
  After yesterday’s completion of the ESA two-day cardiological experiment CARD (Long Term Microgravity: A Model for Investigating Mechanisms of Heart Disease), Wakata today closed out the HLTA BP (Holter Arterial Blood Pressure) activity by removing the digital ECG recorder from his body and restowing its MiniDV tape plus two Multi Media Cards in a bag for return on 2J/A.
 
  After configuring the DC1 (Docking Compartment) comm system for their stay (and later restoring it to nominal settings), CDR Padalka &amp; FE-1 Barratt worked several hours in the DC1 on preparations for the Russian spacewalks, EVA-22 &amp; EVA-23, by staging EVA equipment &amp; tools and readying take-out kits, supported by ground specialist tagup.
 
  Meanwhile, in the US Airlock FE-2 Wakata wrapped up the BC4 (Battery Charger 4) troubleshooting by terminating the test discharge of EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) battery #2037 in BC4.
 
  With the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) video system no longer required after the checkout of the Lab &amp; Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) on 5/19 in preparation for the upcoming Mission 2J/A (6/13), the FE-1 disconnected and took down the UOP DCP (Utility Outlet Panel/Display &amp; Control Panel) power bypass cable at the RWS.
 
  The CDR collected the periodic readings of potentially harmful atmospheric contaminants in the SM (Service Module), using the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M Real-Time Harmful Contaminant Gas Analyzer suite, today using preprogrammed microchips to measure for Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and Carbon Monoxide (CO).
 
  Afterwards, Padalka worked on KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, inspecting and tightening the holding clamp of a half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit where he had replaced a pump unit of the 4SPN1 replaceable pump panel on 5/19.
 
  In the US Lab, Mike Barratt reinstalled the alignment guides on the FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility) in the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to lock down the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System), after their temporary removal yesterday.
 
  After setting up the G1 camcorder for an "over the shoulder" camera view, the FE-2 worked on Part 2 of troubleshooting the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation), consisting of a thorough cleaning of the CEVIS interior using a toothbrush and vacuum cleaner, particularly of its load-inducing braking band and fan area as well as other areas of the ergometer.  This required the removal (and subsequent reinstallation) of the braking band on the flywheel.  It also included the standard isolator inspection.  Any not-completed steps are to be finished at a later time.   [The issue (which made the CEVIS unusable) was an observed workload discrepancy between the commanded and actual workloads for an exercise run, mostly when the commanded workload was at 75 watts.  The crew has performed specific IFM (Inflight Maintenance) to aid engineers in assessing this anomaly and has also performed Part 1 of the troubleshooting.  The ground will inspect the photo documentation before giving the Go to reinstall the CEVIS on the frame for exercise.]
 
  At ~2:45am EDT, Koichi Wakata had 30 min for making two 15-min CDE (Crew Discretionary Event) calls, one to the JAXA Flight Control Team, the second to the JAXA Training Personnel at Tsukuba/Japan, via S-band/audio &amp; Ku-band/video.
 
  At ~4:00am, the crew held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
  At ~4:15am, Gennady linked up with TsUP/Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
  At ~3:20pm, the ISS crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H via S-band/audio.    [S/G-2 (Space-to-Ground 2) phone patch via SSC (Station Support Computer).]
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-2) and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).    [The CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) continues to be unusable (see above).]
 
  Afterwards, Mike downloaded the exercise data file to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlinking, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  CDR Padalka had five job items on his discretionary “time permitting” task list:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">The routine daily servicing of the SOZh      system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Daily IMS (Inventory Management System)      maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file”      including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated      export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow,      Baikonur),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another run      with the GFI-8 "Uragan"      (hurricane) earth-imaging program, using the NIKON D2X digital camera to      take 800mm-lens telephotos for subsequent downlinking on the BSR-TM      payload data channel,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Urine transfer to the Progress Rodnik tankage,      and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">An      audit/inventory of TP-TRG-L thermally conducting gaskets for various      electronic components such as GIVUS A6, the TVM &amp; TsVM Computers, and      SNT Voltage &amp; Current Stabilizers.</li> </ul> 
 WRM Update:  A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked last night to the crew for their reference, updated with yesterday’s CWC water audit.    [The new card (19-0025I) lists 44 CWCs (~1,325.4 L total) for the four types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (30 CWCs with 908.3 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 263.8 L currently off-limits pending sample analysis on the ground &amp; 644.5 L for flushing only due to Wautersia bacteria), 2. potable water (8 CWCs with 349.6 L, of which 221.3 L are currently off-limit pending ground analysis results), 3. condensate water (3 CWCs, all empty), 4. waste/EMU dump and other (3 CWCs with 67.5 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 Conjunction Advisory:   No improvement.  Tracking information on the new orbital debris is difficult to obtain.  Object 34716 is a small piece, one of ~2500 tracked pieces, of the Chinese Fengyun-1C weather satellite, destroyed on 1/11/07 for an ASAT demo.  Close approach to the ISS is tomorrow (Saturday); TCA (Time of Closest Approach): 5:30pm EDT.  Radial miss distance: -0.25 km (projected from limited tracking).  Go/NoGo decision time for DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) cyclogram built (maneuver programming): tonight at 6:00pm EDT.  Nominal DAM execution: tomorrow (5/23) at 3:10pm EDT.  A maneuver of plus/minus 0.5 m/s would still keep Soyuz 19S within rendezvous/docking limits.
 
 STS-125/Atlantis Return:   Due to bad weather, today’s return of Atlantis to KSC was called off for both opportunities.
