ISS On-Orbit Status 06/27/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Underway:� Week 15 of Increment 27/28.
 
FE-5 Furukawa &amp; FE-6 Fossum undertook their 3<sup>rd</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.       [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev’s morning inspection today included the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
FE-4 Volkov tended the current experiment with the Russian/German KPT-21 Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall/PK-3+) payload, running in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, by checking the hermeticity of the evacuated EB vacuum chamber after wakeup and before bedtime (any pressure increase above the vacuum should stay within 5 mmHg).��� After configuring the STTS comm system for working in MRM2, Sergei then set up and initiated the experiment.� Later, the system was disconnected, results downloaded &amp; downlinked and PK-3 deactivated.� FE-1 Samokutyayev assisted in MRM2 by taking documentary photographs of the experiment.�   � [Main objective of PK-3 is to study crystallization dynamics at constant argon pressures (10 Pa) with superimposed low-frequency and varied voltage electrical field, using 2.55� particles. This session is run in semi-automatic mode.]
 
Working on the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment, CDR Borisenko replaced Laptop 3 with a new laptop, no. 6092, configured it with the settings for the SP spectrometer settings, activated the latter and tested the new setup.      [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from windows #9 &amp; #6, with spectrometer measurements controlled from laptop.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
FE-3 Garan replaced the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) toilet pre-treat tank (E-K) and the pre-treat tank hose with fresh spares. �   [The E-K tank contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid), CrO<sub>3</sub> (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H<sub>2</sub>O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in a dispenser (DKiV) and used for toilet flushing.]
 
Samokutyayev had another hour set aside for unloading the Progress M-11M/43P cargo spacecraft, docked at SM aft end port, and transferring cargo to the ISS for stowage, based on uplinked tabular listings.
 
FE-4 Volkov &amp; Samokutyayev joined up for testing Soyuz 26S &amp; Soyuz 27S communications.���� [Steps included checking hard-line comm between ISS and both docked spacecraft, VHF2 from each Soyuz separately to RGS (Russian Ground Sites), VHF2 Simplex Mode between the two docked spacecraft with S-band &amp; SM VHF-1, verifying MCC-Houston Public Call configuration, and returning to nominal STTS stage comm with no Shuttle docked.] 
 
FE-6 Mike Fossum set up the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware including MBS (Mixing Bag System) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), and then conducted his first session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, integrated with Thermolab.  Afterwards, Mike powered down, cleaned up and temporarily stowed selected hardware in deployed condition for the next user, then downloaded the data to a PCS laptop.       [VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
Samokutyayev conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
In Node-2, Ron Garan installed and checked out the CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System) at the nadir port for the MPLM-2 (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module 2) “Raffaello” berthing after arrival of STS-135/ULF7.
 
In MRM2, Sergei Volkov installed a new Progress-delivered contact device at the MGK hatch cover sealing drive mechanism of the ASP docking ring between MRM2 &amp; Soyuz 26S.
 
Using the NIKON D2X camera with flash, Borisenko took situational GFI-11 Obstanovka (Background) images of the spaces behind panel 428.
 
Andrey Borisenko completed the periodic refresh of the IUS AntiVirus program on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2.       [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update.� Until a new automated procedure has been cleared for use, the refresh is done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1.� On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning will be verified on all laptops.� Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p &amp; RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.]
 
FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa had another 3h 50m reserved on his timeline for continuing prepacking ULF7 return cargo, followed (~12:50pm) by ground specialist tagup for debriefing.
 
Ron, Mike &amp; Satoshi each completed their first onboard sessions with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.       [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
Furukawa performed the periodic module hatch seal inspection in Node-12 &amp; A/L (Airlock), for which he had ~35 min.��� [Checked were the hatches at Node-1 Stbd &amp; Aft plus the A/L IV (intravehicular) hatches.]
 
Afterwards, Satoshi also completed his POMS (Profile of Mood States) questionnaire for downlink to ground specialist.
 
Aleks Samokutyayev made preparations for tomorrow’s window inspection in the RS (Russian Segment), intended to assess the glass panes in windows 3, 5 &amp; 9 to identify any deterioration of condition compared to the inspection results from previous expeditions (new caverns, scratches, spots or blurs affecting the glass transparency or further aggravation of older defects).���� [Besides gathering the necessary equipment, Sasha reviewed uplinked instructions and printed out pages with windows 3, 5 &amp; 9 diagrams with the defects found earlier and the tables listing defects.]
 
Using an uplinked updated listing, Ron Garan had ~2 hrs in the A/L for configuring tools &amp; equipment for his &amp; Mike’s EVA during ULF7.
 
Furukawa &amp; Fossum spent about an hour with Garan in a handover session, their 4<sup>th</sup>, during which Ron familiarized his crewmates with USOS (US Segment) activities.
 
Before sleeptime, Sasha will start battery charging for the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware for another run tomorrow.     [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module.]
 
FE-3, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Mike at ~12:00pm, Ron at ~12:50pm, Satoshi at ~2:30pm EDT.
 
At ~11:15am, Sasha, Sergei &amp; Andrey supported a Russian PAO TV downlink, transmitting messages of greetings to three events: (1) to the participants of the 16<sup>th</sup> Governor Graduation Ball on 6/29 in the ice palace “Vitiaz” in the town of Podolsk near Moscow;� (2) to the opening of the Summer Semester of the “Russian Railroads” company in the city of Sochi on 6/30 for the Student Workforce; (3) to the participants of the Russian Music Festival “Invasion-2011” in Bolshoye Zavidiovo of Tver Region from 6/8 through 6/10.      [The 16<sup>th</sup> Governor Graduation Ball is a celebration of high school graduates who received Gold and Silver “For Special Achievements in Learning” Medal awards.-� Under the umbrella of the Governmental Youth Programs, “Russian Railroads” is leading a significant effort to restore the movement of Student Workforce.� In 2011, over 1100 college students from Russia, former republics and Baltic states will participate in the Summer Semester.� All of them will be supporting the construction of transport infrastructure for the 2014 Winter Olympics that will take place in Sochi. This is a unique college student participation program in a construction project of such large scale.-� The Russian Music Festival “Invasion-2011” is the 10<sup>th</sup> open air festival.� According to already established tradition, pilot groups Strizhi and Russian Bityazi (Russian Knights) will be performing under the auspices of this festival.] 
 
The Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list for Samokutyayev, Borisenko &amp; Volkov for today showed the preparation &amp; downlinking of more reportages (text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-4), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).
 
No CEO targets uplinked for today.
