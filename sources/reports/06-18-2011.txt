ISS On-Orbit Status 06/18/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday �C Crew off-duty day. [Note AMS-2 Report, below!]
 
The six crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of the uborka house cleaning, CDR Borisenko, FE-1 Samokutyayev &amp; FE-4 Volkov completed regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM (Service Module), preceded by documentary photography, and the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on its total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
Borisenko also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
At ~8:15am EDT, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
As a follow-up to yesterday’s ODF (Operations Data File) update, FE-6 Fossum made a number of additional P&amp;I (Pen &amp; Ink) changes to procedures pages in the 6 copies of the EMER-1 book, from SM, MRM1, Soyuz, A/L, Lab, and Node-2, to reflect the recent SSCV4 (Station Support Computer transition to Vers. 4 software).
 
FE-5 Furukawa began his first Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment, assisted by Mike Fossum as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres.         [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist &amp; ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Satoshi started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.  The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.]
 
Mike also powered on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and started the data flow of video recorded yesterday of his first session of the new T2 Treadmill Kinematics program to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  Later, the MPC was turned off again.
 
At ~10:00am EDT, Andrey, Sasha &amp; Sergei engaged in a PAO phone interview via S-band with Ekaterina Beloglazova, Editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos (Russian Space) Magazine and an old friend of ISS cosmonauts.     [Questions �C for Sergei:  “How was Soyuz TMA-02M vehicle behaving?  
How did ISS and the crew welcome you?  What new did you find on the station while you were away?  How quick was your adaptation?  How is the newcomer, Satoshi Furukawa, doing?”, - for Sasha: “Alexander, you are blogging now and answering questions.  Who is helping you? Is it hard to do?  Who took that fabulous picture of approaching vehicle with a cyclone in the background?  What was the most interesting question and from whom?”, - for everybody:  “What are you going to plant in the Lada greenhouse and when?  Pretty soon you will have Russian and European docking-undocking events.  How are you getting ready for them?  In July Shuttle crew will come to visit you.  Atlantis will make its final space journey.  What do you think about Shuttle contribution to cosmonautics?”]
 
At ~12:30pm, the three Russian crewmembers conducted an amateur/ham radio exchange with participants of the Slavic Fellowship International Forum (close to 500 participants), for whom they had downlinked video greetings on 6/13.      [Questions from the ground:   “Is it true that to become a cosmonaut, one needs to pass close to 500 exams, and which one was the most difficult for you?  Did your perception about a human being change after your flight to space?  Is female presence on a space ship a bad thing or this statement does not apply to space ships?  Have you ever been to Elbrus or other mountain peaks?  What is harder to conquer:  Space or mountain peaks?  How does one celebrate a birthday in space, if candles are not burning on the ISS?  Where does a human being feel better, on the ground or in a space vehicle?  On the ground everybody is looking forward to the weekend, and how is it in Space?  This is a question for Sergei Volkov from Donetsk students:  What would you like to wish to all the participants of the Slavic Fellowship and to all of the contemporary youth in general?   Alexander Mikhailovich, you like travelling.  What do you like the most in travel?  Andrey Ivanovich, what is your hobby on the ground, when you are away from work?”]
 
CDR &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Andrey at ~6:45am, Mike at ~11:30am EDT.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-4, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).
 
WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (28-0014B) lists 103 good CWCs (2,341 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (21 CWCs with 846.4 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 562.2 L in 14 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (70 CWCs with 1,278.3 L (also 35 expired or leaking bags with 641.5 L);  4. condensate water (180.7 L in 8 bags, plus 2 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (35.6 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health],
