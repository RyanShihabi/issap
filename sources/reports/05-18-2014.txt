SpaceX-3 Release:  Today ISS CDR Swanson completed closeout of the Node 2 nadir vestibule, removed the final power jumpers and closed the Node 2 nadir hatch.  He then depressed the vestibule and demated the Common Berthing Mechanism (CMB) bolts and latches.  Using the Space Station Robotic Manipulator System (SSRMS) robotics ground controllers performed the SpaceX unberth from Node 2 nadir and maneuvered SpaceX-3 to the release postion.    Swanson, with robotics assistance from FE-1 Skvortsov, completed the SpaceX Dragon release from the SSRMS on time at 8:26am CDT.  After Dragon departure, the robotics ground controllers maneuvered the SSRMS to a park position, performed a video survey of the Node2 nadir CBM and then powered it down.  SpaceX-3 splashdown occurred at approximately 2:04pm CDT today.
Lab Smoke Detector Annunciation:  Before crew wake, one of the crew members detected an odor.  Swanson investigated, but could not confirm the source.  Later, the LAB1PD1 smoke detector annunciated and then returned to normal.  The crew investigated, including CSA-CP checks which were nominal.  The crew did find a strip of tape that had been melted. Investigation into the event is continuing.
