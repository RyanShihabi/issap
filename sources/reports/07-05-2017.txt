Rodent Research-5 (RR-5) Systemic Therapy of NELL-1 for Osteoporosis:  The crew completed injections of half of the RR-5 mice remaining on the ISS in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) and performed bone densitometer scans of each of those mice. Because spaceflight has significant and rapid effects on the musculoskeletal system it is important to investigate targeted therapies that could ameliorate some of the detrimental effects of spaceflight. The NELL-1 drug being studied in the RR-5 investigation has the potential to slow or reverse bone loss during spaceflight.The Bone Densitometer device measures the density of minerals in bone. Quantitative measures of bone loss in mice during orbital space flight provide data for the development of countermeasures for human crewmembers, as well as for bone-loss syndromes on Earth. 
S-Band String 2 Space to Ground (S/G)-2 Audio Troubleshooting: Ground teams performed troubleshooting steps for distorted S/G-2 downlink voice experienced while on S-Band String 2. The distortion was first observed last Wednesday, June 28th.  Since then, ground teams performed various troubleshooting steps to isolate the problem to String 2 of the S-Band System. Today’s troubleshooting focused on the S-Band Baseband Signal Processor (BSP)-2.  BSP-2 built in tests were executed without errors followed by a power cycle of the unit and a repeat of S/G-2 communication checks. The distortion was no longer present after the power cycle.  S-Band String 2 remains the active string.
