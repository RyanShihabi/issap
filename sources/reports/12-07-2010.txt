ISS On-Orbit Status 12/07/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;Today 38 years ago (1972), NASA launched Apollo 17 for the sixth and final lunar landing of the Apollo Program, with the crew of CDR Gene Cernan, CM Pilot Ron Evans &amp; LM Pilot Harrison Schmitt (the first scientist, flying in lieu of originally selected X-15 test pilot Joe Engle).  It was the 11<sup>th</sup> manned Apollo mission and the first night launch of a U.S. human spaceflight.  Landing at Taurus-Littrow was on 12/11, for a lunar surface time of 3d 3h.  Splashdown on 12/19 ended the Apollo Program.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
 At day’s begin, FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 CDR Kelly had ~1h25m set aside for maintenance work on the three MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) units, first checking their internal N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) pressure for being within acceptable limits, then reconfiguring MELFI-3 dewars for ULF5.     [In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), N<sub>2</sub> pressures were nominal for MELFI-1 (loc. D4) and MELFI-3 (loc. A1), and it was also nominal for MELFI-2 in the Lab (loc. S1).  For MELFI-3 reconfiguration, Scott retrieved 13 ½-box modules from stowage and set them aside temporarily, then removed Icepac belts and ¼-box modules and reconfigured MELFI-3’s Dewar 1 with all ½-box modules and ice bricks.  Due to time overrun with Dewar 1, Dewar 2 will be rescheduled at a future date.  The unexpectedly time-consuming issue turned out to be the handling of numerous piece parts in micro-G.] 
 
 Later, Scott completed another periodic relocation of the TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly, the primary radiation measurement tool in the ISS, moving it from COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory, A3) to JPM (F3), utilizing UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) a1 for power.
 
 Working in the MRM1 Rassvet module, FE-1 Kaleri used the Elektronika MMTs-01 MultiMeter to check out a telemetry sensor circuit for FGB docking control behind panel 202, by measuring electrical resistance between two connector pins.  The activity was supported by specialist tagup via S-band.    [For the checkout, VD-SU control mode and US-17-1,2 Matching Unit power had to be turned off.]
 
 Afterwards, Alex started a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok).     [Using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush, FE-1 cleaned filters and fan grilles of the TsV1,2 central circulation ventilators, the detachable VT7 fan screens of the three SOTR gas-liquid heat exchangers (GZhT4), plus the fixed GZhT4 grill, and interior closeout panel vent screens (panels 201, 301, 401).]
 
 FE-2 Skripochka conducted his 2<sup>nd</sup> onboard session of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (“Study of<a name="_Toc416143806"></a><a name="_Toc416143862"></a><a name="_Toc416144063"></a> the Veins in the Lower Extremities”), using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex with orthogonal leads which Oleg Kotov had installed in the SM (Service Module) last February.      [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Skripochka set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump &amp; valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a “body box”) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).]
 
 Oleg also performed his 4<sup>th</sup> data collection for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.      [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
 Kaleri &amp; Skripochka had ~3 hrs for a major joint activity, i.e., performing an assessment of available stowage space in the RS.     [Using CTBEs (Cargo Transfer Bag Equivalents) or dm<sup>3</sup> for measurement units, FE-2 &amp; FE-1 inspected/audited stowage areas in the FGB and behind MRM1 panels, DC1 and MRM2 and, as time permitted, also in SM, referring to potential and estimated volumes listed in uplinked stowage zone &amp; ID tables.]
 
 Scott conducted the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.     [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.]
 
 Performing regular periodic maintenance on the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) in Node-3, the CDR replaced its air filter, which had reached the end of its service life, with a new spare filter retrieved from JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment) stowage.
 
 In the US Lab, Scott Kelly completed IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the CIR/FIR (Combustion Integrated Rack / Fluids Integrated Rack) racks, removing a lower left bridge bracket (with damaged threads) between the racks (loc. D4) and replacing it with a scavenged bridge bracket from the Lab standoff link at loc. OP. 
 
 Afterwards, the CDR conducted the periodic inspection of the PEPs (Portable Emergency Provisions), checking PFEs (Portable Fire Extinguishers, PBAs (Portable Breathing Apparatus), EHTKs (Extension Hose Tee Kits) and QDMA (Quick-Don Mask Assembly) harnesses.     .  [PFEs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in A/L (Airlock), 2 in Lab,1 in Node-2, 1 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL.  PBA O<sub>2</sub> Bottles: 4 in Node-1, 5 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 2 in COL.  QDMAs: 4 in Node-1, 8 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 2 in COL.  EHTKs: 1 in Node-1, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 1 in Node-3. ] 
 
 In the Kibo JPM, Scott supported the BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) payload with sample assessments due to a possible shelf-life problem, in preparation for nominal operations ahead.    [Today’s activities involved homogenizing (mixing) BCAT-5 turbid samples 1, 2 &amp; 3 using a magnet from the TVIS treadmill wrapped in a lens cloth, then taking several photos of each and inspecting them for being either extensively clumped or gelled (i.e., non-viable for further experimentation) or smooth &amp; milky (more likely still viable).  Selected samples will run nominally with automated (no EarthKAM application) photography.  Re-mixing of the first viable sample and automated photography will occur within the next two days after assessment of the photos.]
 
 Working from the US “job jar” task list, Scott also replaced failed LHAs (Lamp Housing Assemblies) in the Lab (locs. OS5 &amp; OP4) and Node-2 (loc. OS4).
 
 Alex did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Oleg completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator
 
 Before sleeptime, FE-2 Skripochka will set up the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 6<sup>th</sup> Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 The crew had their regular PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Scott at ~10:05am, Alex at ~12:00pm, Oleg at ~1:30pm EST.
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded today were Asmara, Eritrea (looking right of track, inland of the coastal mountains.  With its large Italian community and an Italian architectural style, Asmara [nearly 600,000 people] was known as Little Rome when it was the capital of the Italian empire in Africa [1889–1941]), Victoria, Seychelles (looking left of track on the far side of Mahe Island—the nearest to track and largest in the group of three larger islands and numerous small ones.  The Seychelles is a continental fragment left stranded in the Indian Ocean during India’s plate tectonic movement northeast towards Asia.  The rocks of Seychelles are extensions of major formations found in Zambia and South Africa), and Kingston, Jamaica (looking left on the south coast of the island.  Greater Kingston has a population of 650,000.  In the Americas, Kingston is the largest mainly English-speaking city south of the United States).
