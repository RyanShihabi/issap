ISS On-Orbit Status 12/01/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  
 
 After wakeup, FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.      [The filters were installed by Maxim Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Oleg will again inspect the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 With a new EDV-U container in the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), CDR Kelly reconnected the WHC from backflow back to feeding the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly), then reported the flush counter, a periodic activity.
 
 Kelly also started another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.      [This was the 6<sup>th</sup> session with the new GC/DMS unit #1002, after the previous instrument (#1004) was used for approximately 40 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 Later, the CDR performed periodic maintenance on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser by evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.
 
 As part of ongoing troubleshooting of a T2/COLBERT treadmill software issue (Pacebook data sharing), Scott configured the T2 system to be power-cycled by the ground for checking the disk.    [The power-cycle did not fix the issue (i.e., T2 not visible on the OpsLAN network), and Scott transferred the file generated by the Check Disk execution manually to the server (by USB memory stick) for downlink for evaluation, which is currently underway. A rack power-cycle by ground controllers restored Pacebook network visibility.]
 
 FE-1 Kaleri &amp; FE-2 Skripochka meanwhile continued the installation &amp; connection of the new RSPI Radio Data Transmission System instruments &amp; cables in the SM (Service Module).      [In Part 2 of the task, the two flight engineers installed three BD-2 sensor units (A181, A182, A183), mated them to the BKS cabling, routed a host of more cables and installed a BZU (A13) memory unit.  For the reconnection of the BKS onboard cable network, the BRTS Onboard Radio System’s LIV video complex had to be temporarily powered off.  More to come tomorrow and on Friday: 12/2 – cable installation &amp; hook-ups; 12/3 – connecting BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system to the new instruments and replacing a ROM (read-only memory) unit.] 
 
 Continuing the major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the Russian SKV-2 air conditioner in the SM, Oleg Skripochka today conducted tests on its new NOK2 condensate evacuation pump, installed yesterday.     [The activities should reveal whether the SKV-2 will have to be replaced.  The evaporator wicks of the air conditioner’s BTA heat exchanger will be flushed (wetted) next week (12/8).]
 
 Other activities completed by Oleg Skripochka were –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Performing the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA;</li><li>Conducting the regular inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness);</li><li>Undertaking the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors/meters in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways, skipping Soyuz hatches   [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1];</li><li>Completing the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator], and</li><li>Doing the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).</li></ul> 
 Scott Kelly’s long task list included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>The periodic inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks),</li><li>The weekly “T+2d” inflight microbiology analyses of the potable water samples collected on 11/29 from the EHS PWD (Environmental Health Systems / Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient port for inflight analysis   [In-flight sample analysis was performed with the WMK MCD (Water Microbiology Kit/Microbial Capture Devices) for microbial traces, and the CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for inflight coliform bacteria (Escherichia coli) detection (Magenta for Positive, Yellow for Negative).  Results of the on-board processing with the MWAK were available after 4-6 days of incubation];</li><li>The periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose, plus the periodic changeout of the TOCA WWB  (Waste Water Bag   [after the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged],</li><li>The in-flight Silver &amp; Iodine analysis of the SVO-ZV and PWD water samples collected on 11/23, using the CWQMK (Colorimetric Water Quality Monitoring Kit)   [Data were downloaded afterwards to a T61p laptop, and the CWQMK kit was stowed] and</li><li>More cleaning of IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) fans and silencer inlet in the Lab, today in the forward port area   [the silencer inlet could not be accessed with the vacuum cleaner crevice tool, but a visual inspection of some 75% of the filter revealed no significant dirt buildup.  IMV flow measurements are scheduled for tomorrow which will determine whether additional cleaning activities will be pursued.]</li> </ul> 
 At ~9:05am, CDR Kelly had his regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
 New activities added to Scott’s “Job Jar” task list call for the replacement of failed LHAs (Lamp Housing Assemblies) in the Lab (locs. OS1 &amp; OP4) and Node-2 (loc. OS4).
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2) .      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded today were Islamabad, Pakistan (this rapidly growing capital city had a population estimated at 1.21 million in 2009.  It is located in a plateau area of northern Pakistan.  ISS’ descending nadir pass was in early-afternoon light with clear weather expected.  However, hazy conditions persist in this area and the crew may not have spotted the city until they were directly above it), Sierra de los Ajos, Mexico (ISS had an early afternoon, descending pass for this target, offering nadir views.  This club-shaped, roughly north-south range of mountains is situated in the northeastern part of the state of Sonora Mexico between the mining center of Cananea and the General Lazaro Cardenas Reservoir.  With elevations ranging from about 4,000 to 8,600 feet, the Sierra de los Ajos support an ecologically diverse, alpine-woodland habitat within the Sonoran Desert that includes them in the regional province of scattered highlands known as the Madrean Sky Islands of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States.  CEO is seeking detailed mapping views of this target for baseline and change detection of unique and threatened habitat), and Popocatepetl Volcano, Mexico (Mexico’s second highest peak [17,802 feet] is a large, active stratovolcano located 43 miles southeast of Mexico City.  ISS had an early afternoon, descending pass in clear weather.  Within seconds of tracking over the massive urban area of Mexico City, the crew was to look nadir for this target.  Three major explosive eruptions have occurred in the very recent geologic past, producing pyroclastic flows and lahars [mud flows] that affected the basins surrounding the volcano.  Additional Mapping frames of the volcano and flanks are requested to capture current summit glacier extent and cone geomorphology.  Gas and steam emissions can at times be observed emanating from the volcano).
