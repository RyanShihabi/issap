ISS On-Orbit Status 10/20/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
FE-4 Sergey Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
CDR Mike Fossum started his day with the standard 30-day inspection of the AED (Automated External Defibrillator) in the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) rack.  (Mike’s report: “OK &amp; 3 bars.  Checks good.  Cheers!”).        [AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient.  It then can treat them through defibrillation, i.e., the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.]
 
Afterwards, Fossum conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.  No changes to the current card were reported.        [The current card (29-0002C) lists 116 good CWCs (2,635.5 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (30 CWCs with 1,229.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 942.9 L in 24 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 129 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. Iodinated water (74 CWCs with 1,333.6 L (also 33 expired bags with 603.2 L);  4. condensate water (35.7 L in 4 bags, plus 6 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (37.0 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
Before breakfast &amp; first exercise, Volkov took a full session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis, one of four Russian crew health status assessments currently being conducted (the other three: MO-3 (Physical Fitness Evaluation), MO-7 (Calf Volume Measurement) &amp; MO-8 (Body Mass Measurement).   Afterwards, Sergey closed out and stowed the Urolux hardware.         [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).]
 
FE-5 Satoshi Furukawa spent most of his working day on major troubleshooting of the failed GHF (Gradient Heating Furnace) on the Kobairo Rack in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), necessary to resume the GHF experiment.        [Two anomalous overcurrent events of the GHF Central Heater occurred on 4/12/11 &amp; 4/20/11.  Suspected cause of the short circuit was inadvertent contact between a lock wire and a heater flange, or an incorrect position of the End Heater with respect to the Central Heater.  Satoshi’s troubleshooting involved inspection of the End Heater unit and cartridge, checking the lock wire position of the new Central Heater and fix it if needed, attaching heater harnesses and servicing GHF-MPU.  Today’s work, with documentary HD video-shooting, focused on the lock wire of the GHF Central Heater, reconfiguring the JLP HCTL (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment / Heater Controller) power jumper (W3002), replacing the Central Heater in the GHF MP (Material Processing Unit) with a new unit, connecting two thermocouple harnesses to the Central Heater and vacuum-cleaning the GHF End Heater.  Afterwards, the GHF MPU access door was closed temporarily (more work is scheduled tomorrow).]
 
FE-4 completed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 &amp; A24 root modules and taking the weekly documentary photography of setup &amp; activities.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]
 
With the STTS communications system configured for working in the MRM2 Poisk module, Sergey Volkov installed and prepared the equipment for another run of the new KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall-3 plus) Telescience payload, the 2<sup>nd</sup> time for Expedition 28.  The FE-4 then conducted a leak check on the EB vacuum chamber, loaded new software, copied and downlinked data &amp; log files and later returned the STTS comm system to nominal.      [The PK-3+ hardware comprises the EB (Eksperimental’nyj Blok) Experiment Module with a turbopump for evacuation, Ts laptop, video monitor, vacuum hoses, electrical circuitry, four hard storage disks for video, and one USB stick with the control application.  After setting up the hardware in MRM2 (it used to be run in the SM/Service Module), Sergey today configured vacuum and electrical connections, installed external hard drives and conducted a leak check on the electronics box.  The experiment is performed on plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber.  Main objective is to obtain a homogeneous plasma dust cloud at various pressures and particle quantities with or without superimposition of an LF (low frequency) harmonic electrical field.  The experiment is conducted in automated mode.  PK-3+ has more advanced hardware and software than the previously used Russian PKE-Nefedov payload.]
 
With CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) in the Lab adjusted to permit access, Mike Fossum worked on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to configure it for the upcoming FLEX-2 (Flame Extinguishment Experiment 2) payload activities.        [The job concerned changing the back of the CIR Optics Bench from MDCA (Multi-User Droplet Combustion Apparatus) FLEX to the next part, MDCA FLEX-2.  This involved translating out and rotating down the Optics Bench, with lines removed, moving the FCF IPSU (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility / Image Processing &amp; Storage Unit) from UML7 to UML5 plus adding another IPSU on top of the one at UML5, installing an FCF Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter DCM (Diagnostic Control Module), relocating the CIR HiBMS (High Bit-Depth Multi-Spectral) imaging package, removing the FCF DCM, and reconfiguring (swapping) the CIR HiBMS imaging packages on UML7 and UML8 for taking science images of FLEX-2 test points.  Finally, activities were reversed for backing out and closing out.]

When filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit;   [the 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.]</li></ul> 
Satoshi performed his 4<sup>th</sup> session of the new Treadmill Kinematics program on the T2/COLBERT treadmill, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint &amp; muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.]
 
Before “Presleep” period tonight, Furukawa turns on MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) HD routing and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Mike will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
At ~9:20am EDT, Mike Fossum conducted his regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
Plaque Hanging:   At 2:30pm, the traditional official plaque hanging took place in ISS Mission Control/Houston for the Inc-28 Plaque with crew participation.
 
ISS Reboost Update:  Yesterday’s ISS reboost by the two KD engines of the SM’s ODU (Integrated Propulsion System) was performed on time (12:15pm) with a burn duration of 1 min 53 sec, yielding a delta-V of 1.86 m/s/6.1 ft/s (planned: 1.80/5.9).  Mean altitude gain: 3.24 km (1.75 nmi).  ISS now is at a mean altitude of 388 km (209.5 nmi), with ~400 km (216 nmi) apogee &amp; 376 km (203 nmi) perigee height.   Purpose of the reboost was to set up phasing for 45P launch, 28S launch, and 27S landing.
 
Conjunction Alert:     Flight controllers are tracking a new conjunction with Object #27700 (H-2A Rocket Body).  TCA (Time of Closest Approach):  10/22 (Saturday), 6:31pm EDT.  The object is in a fairly circular orbit, large and well tracked which should provide stable tracking data throughout this event.  If DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) planning is required, the Go/No-Go for firing table (cyclogram) development will be tomorrow (10/21) at 7:01pm, for an estimated DAM TIG (Time of Ignition) on 10/22 at 4:13pm. 
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).
 
Tasks listed for Sergei Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Continuing the preparation &amp; downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Another ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.</li></ul> 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Mumbai, India Aerosol in the Arabian Sea (Dynamic event.  With an approximate repeat of the pass of two days ago, CEO staff suggested a far left look angle to document a major smog outflow event from India.  The margin between smoggy and clear air is still apparent over the sea surface in satellite imagery), and Georgetown, Guyana (looking well left of track:  this capital city lies on the coast, at the mouth of the Demerara River.  Due to scattered clouds the viewing conditions are not ideal, but with the present low number of available targets, CEO staff requested this challenging city).
