Mission ULF-6’s EVA-4 was completed successfully by EV1 Greg Chamitoff &amp; EV2 Mike Fincke in 7h 24m, accomplishing all objectives.  Beginning this morning at 12:15am EDT, the spacewalk ended at 7:39am.     [EV1 &amp; EV2 began their “campout” yesterday before noon in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe (~10:21am-11:26am) and sleep from 11:56am-7:56pm.  Sleep for the ISS crew began 30 min earlier.  A hygiene break, with temporary repress to 14.7psi and depress back to 10.2psi, took place at 8:31pm-9:41pm, followed by EMU Preps (9:41pm-11:11pm), EMU Purge, EMU Prebreathe, suit leak checks, Crewlock Depress &amp; Egress (~12:15am), about 30 min earlier than scheduled.  The excursion lasted 7h 24m.  It was the last of the four spacewalks for the STS-134 mission, for a mission total of 28h 44m, and it also was the final spacewalk conducted by Space Shuttle astronauts.  At 5:02am (4h 47m into the EVA-4), Spanky &amp; Taz surpassed the 1,000th hour that astronauts &amp; cosmonauts have spent outside the ISS in support of its assembly &amp; maintenance.  It was the 159<sup>th</sup> EVA for ISS assembly &amp; maintenance, totaling 1,002h 37m, and the 164<sup>th</sup> Shuttle EVA. It was also the 248<sup>th</sup> spacewalk U.S. astronauts have ever conducted and the 118<sup>th</sup> from ISS airlocks.  For Fincke, it was the 9<sup>th</sup> EVA, for a total time of 48h 37m; he is 6<sup>th</sup> on the all-time list.  At about 8pm EDT tonight, he will become the U.S. astronaut who has spent the most number of days in space, surpassing Peggy Whitson's record of 377 days in space. For Chamitoff, it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> spacewalk, for a total of 13h 43m.]
 
During EVA-4, Greg &amp; Mike –
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Permanently stowed the 50-ft OBSS (Orbiter Boom Sensor System) on the S1 truss, now known as EIBA (Enhanced ISS Boom Assembly) &amp; grounded connectors,
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Retrieved the PDGF (Power &amp; data grapple fixture) from portside truss segment 6 (P6),
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Swapped the OBSS EFGF (electrically flight-releasable grapple fixture) with the PDGF and stowed the former inside the station for possible return on STS-135/ULF7,

<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Cleaned up &amp; ingressed.
 
First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking &amp; brushing teeth, FE-3 Ron Garan performed his 3<sup>rd</sup> saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 3).       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
Before breakfast &amp; first exercise, CDR Borisenko &amp; FE-1 Samokutyayev each took a full session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis, one of four Russian crew health status assessments currently being conducted (the other three: MO-3 (Physical Fitness Evaluation), MO-7 (Calf Volume Measurement) &amp; MO-8 (Body Mass Measurement).  Afterwards, Aleksandr closed out and stowed the Urolux hardware.      [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).]
 
Afterwards, Samokutyayev continued the new round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok).      [Using a vacuum cleaner and soft brush, FE-1 cleaned the screen of the TsV1 central circulation ventilator.]
 
Sasha also configured the pumping equipment with the electric compressor and then transferred urine from an EDV-U container (#883) to BV1 Rodnik water storage tank of Progress 42P (#410) which he had emptied of its water on 5/18.     [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
Later, FE-1 installed a new FA-V aerosol filter in the hydrogen line of the Elektron-VM oxygen generator after removing &amp; inspecting the old filter.
 
Andrey Borisenko spent another large block of time on routing &amp; installing 2 glass-fiber cables for the new Russian experimental SLS Laser Communications System in the SM (Service Module), mating them to the BKS Onboard Cable Network behind the Medical Cabinet and panels 221, 218, 217, 213 &amp; 215.
 
Afterwards, Borisenko also –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5">Performed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways to see how the ventilation/circulation system is coping with the 9-person crew,  [inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5">Conducted the daily monitoring of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM which is taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle docked phase.  The data were later copied from the BUSD Control &amp; Data Gathering Unit to a USB-D-M-3 stick for downlink to the ground.  The BUSD archive was then deleted and the DAKON-M restarted.  [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.] and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo5">Gathered the RBO-3-2 Matryoshka-R bubble dosimeters deployed by Sasha on 5/20 and collected their accumulated radiation readings. </li></ul> 
CDR Mark Kelly provided photo/video support during the EVA,
 
After the EVA, activities by Mark, Spanky, Taz &amp; Ron included the usual post-EVA tasks like photographing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) gloves for inspection, recharging EMUs with water, downloading &amp; downlinking D2XS EVA &amp; glove photographs, recharging EMU and REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly) batteries, etc.
 
Other activities completed by Ron Garan included –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo6">Activation of the VWS (Video Streaming Workstation) &amp; SSC (Station Support Computer) for covering the spacewalk, later deactivating the system,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo6">Providing EVA support, first during Campout preparations &amp; prebreathing, later during post-EVA activities in the A/L (Airlock),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo6">Performing the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate water container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 17min (during which WHC was not available), and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo6">Supporting the JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), by putting ~100 ml of water in each of 2 drinking water containers from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser), followed by a review of the MYCO sampling procedures scheduled tomorrow morning by PLT Gregory Johnson &amp; herself.   [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO body samples are collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss].</li></ul> 
Alex Samokutyayev completed the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness).
 
FE-1 also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Later, Sasha took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
At ~8:26am EDT, Andrey &amp; Alex held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/Glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP-Moscow via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
At ~8:41pm, Sasha &amp; Andrey linked up with TsUP/Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
Before his “Presleep” period, Ron Garan power on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and started the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC was turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
