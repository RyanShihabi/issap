ISS On-Orbit Status 05/08/12

All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.

Upon wakeup, FE-5 André Kuipers & FE-6 Don Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, their 39th. [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup & before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS. The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]

After breakfast, CDR Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.

Kononenko also completed the routine verification of yesterday’s automated refreshes of the IUS AntiVirus program on all Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p & RSK2. [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the recent SSCV4 software update. Before the installation on 8/8/11 of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p & RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med & RSE1. On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops. Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p & RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily. On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday.]

FE-5 conducted routine maintenance on the WRS (Water Recovery System) using the LFTP (Low Flow Transfer Pump) to transfer one CWC-I (-Iodine) to the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) and offloading it, using a particulate filter. [Estimated offload time: ~4:45 hrs; max. allowed quantity: 88%].

In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Pettit configured the equipment for the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment and then began his 4th (FD135) session, after preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres with the assistance of André Kuipers. At ~9:25am EDT, FE-6 observed the initial 10-min rest period under quiet, restful conditions before going about his business. [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan & an ambulatory monitoring session. Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist & ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, André started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment. During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis. The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute). After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours. After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink. The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise. The primary objective of the accompanying CCISS (Cardiovascular Control on return from the ISS) experiment is to maximize the information about changes in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular function that might compromise the ability of astronauts to meet the challenge of return to an upright posture on Earth.]

André had another hour set aside for more cargo gathering & prepacking for return on the SpaceX Dragon capsule.

The CDR completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).

Kononenko also took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM. [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.]

Afterwards, Oleg completed another 30-min. session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining HDV (Z1) camcorder footage of color bloom patterns in the waters of the Central-Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop.

At ~5:45am EDT, the three station residents jointly undertook the standard 70-min. Depress OBT (on-board training) session for Inc-31, with procedures to refresh their proficiency in responding to a rapid depressurization emergency. A joint debrief with ground specialists via S-band at ~8:10am wrapped up the exercise. [Objective of the exercise is to provide proficiency training for crew response during depressurization. The training exercise is performed under the most realistic emergency conditions possible. Instructors & OBT experts at the control centers (TsUP-Moscow, MCC-Houston, COL-CC/Oberpfaffenhofen and SSIPC/Tsukuba) stood by to send commands as required and respond to crew questions. The crew moved throughout the station in order to simulate emergency response actions per procedures at specific checkpoints; they communicated & coordinated simulated actions with the control centers as if this were a real event.]

Afterwards, Kuipers & Kononenko supported the ground in checking out multicast communication performance, evaluating the audio quality of the two space-to-ground channels S/G1 & S/G2 simultaneously from predefined locations as the ground performed ten counts on them.

Pettit meanwhile prepared for the arrival of Soyuz 30S crewmember Joe Acaba, retrieving crew provision items needed by him for his first few days on orbit that were not already in his locker or CQ (Crew Quarters). [If time allowed, Don was to trash old crew provisions to make room for the new items coming up on future flights.] 

Oleg Kononenko used the KPT-2 payload and the AU-1 ultrasound analyzer of its BAR science instruments suite for updating background acoustics levels measured at the windows of the SM PkhO Transfer Compartment) and RO Working Compartment, using the RSE1 laptop. [KPT-2 monitors problem areas, necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life. Data are copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities are supported by ground specialist tagup as required. Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night). Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods & means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization. Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer / thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times. Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]

André made preparations for tomorrow’s scheduled first session with the new ESA ENERGY science experiment, setting up the armband activity monitor using the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop, taking ISS tap water samples from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) in the Lab and configuring the PFS (Pulmonary Function System) for the ENERGY session. [The armband monitor is positioned on the right triceps where it will start automatically on skin contact. The instrument must be worn for the entire 10-day ENERGY measurement period and removed only during showers or if needed during blood draws. Activities without the Armband monitor on the triceps must be carefully logged. The monitor will be removed at the end of the 10-day period, then data will be downloaded from the device. Background: The observed loss of astronauts’ body mass during space flight is partly due to the systematic ongoing negative energy balance in micro-G, in addition to disuse. Unfortunately, the reason for such unbalanced match between intake and output is not clear, but appealing data suggest a relation between the degree of energy deficit and the exercise level prescribed as a countermeasure. Purpose of the ENERGY experiment is (1) to measure changes in energy balance during long term space flight, (2) to measure adaptations in the components of the Total Energy Expenditure TEE (consumption), and (3) to derive an equation for the energy requirements of astronauts. TEE is the sum of resting metabolic rate (RMR, measured), diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT, measured oxygen-uptake minus RMR) and activity-related energy expenditure (AEE, calculated).]

Starting a new round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Oleg worked in the MRM2 Poisk module, replacing the PF1 & PF2 dust filters with new units and cleaning the VD1 & VD2 air ducts and V1 & V2 fan grills.

In the US Lab, Don set up the video camcorder for capturing his cabin activities, then performed troubleshooting on the CSAC (Chip-Scale Atomic Clock) equipment of the SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites) experiment. [Two SPHERES CSACs are installed for their part in SPHERES test sessions. An atomic clock uses an electronic transition frequency in the microwave, optical or ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum of atoms. The most accurate time and frequency standards known, they are used for international time distribution services, to control the wave frequency of television broadcasts and in global navigation systems such as GPS. CSACs represent the latest development of these atomic timekeeping systems. For the troubleshooting, Don was to measure and record resistance between power, return and ground pins on the Reference Clock power connector to look for a possible short. If none found, he was to individually re-power Ref Clock and the two Atomic Clocks to verify their functionality.]

Pettit had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer). [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]

Before Presleep, Kuipers will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations & Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link). After about an hour, André turns MPC routing off again. [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]

CDR & FE-5 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) scheduled, via S- & Ku-band audio/video, André at ~9:25am, Oleg at ~1:55pm EDT.

At ~10:55am, Pettit & Kuipers supported an ESA PAO TV event, downlinking greetings to and responding to questions from participants at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Annual Global Conference at Rotterdam, Netherlands.

The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR). [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL. No exercise is being timelined for Fridays. If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]

Tasks listed for Kononenko on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C
A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and
・ More preparation & downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Aral Sea, Central Asia (looking left and right of track to document the present status of the reduced waterbodies of the Aral Sea; nadir pass), Jornada Basin, New Mexico (overlapping images left and right of nadir were requested for this ecology site. Seasonal and climatic conditions in the vulnerable desert environment produce significant vegetation change, with soil loss during periods of degraded vegetation cover. The site lies between the Rio Grande and the San Andrés Mts., the crew’s main visual cues), and Charlevoix Impact Crater, Quebec, Canada (looking right, on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. The crater is just downstream of an island in the river. If the crew shot the shoreline right of track they will have acquired the target. Only the northern half of the crater is preserved. It is dated as ~342 million years old, long before the present Atlantic Ocean opened up. Detailed imagery helps sophisticate understanding of impact craters).
