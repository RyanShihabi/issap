SpaceX-25 Undock and Return: Cargo Dragon SpaceX-25 (SpX-25) undocked from the ISS today at 10:00 AM CT to return cargo and payloads to the ground concluding the 33-day mission aboard the ISS. SpX-25 will complete departure phasing throughout the day, jettison the Trunk for destructive re-entry, deorbit, and then splash down off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida on Saturday, August 20, at approximately 1:53 PM CT.
Systems: 
Countermeasures System (CMS) Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) Quarterly Inspection: Today, the ISS crew completed regularly scheduled maintenance on the ARED Vibration Isolation System (VIS) Rails and Rollers, Upper Stop Cables, and X-Rotation Dashpots. The crew also provided feedback on ARED performance while the ARED Lift Bar was moving between Lower Stops and Upper Stops. This quarterly maintenance allows the ARED exercise device to keep operating nominally as well as verifying if any wear and tear exists on the hardware.
Cargo Dragon Departure Activities: Prior to departure, the crew packed Double Cold Bags into the SpX-25 vehicle and verified the final cargo arrangement. The crew then configured Cargo Dragon for departure, final egress, and Dragon hatch closure. After departure, the crew tore down equipment for monitoring, relocated the Station Support Computer (SSC) back to its nominal location and replaced the stowage in the Node 2 Forward Endcone.
