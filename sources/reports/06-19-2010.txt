ISS On-Orbit Status 06/19/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – crew half-duty day.
  
 Crew wake time is back to normal: 2:00am-5:30pm EDT.
 
  FE-3 Kornienko started out by conducting the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  At wake-up, FE-2 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson continued her current session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  Caldwell-Dyson also continued the new week-long run of the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), her 4<sup>th</sup>, transferring data from her Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Returning to the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Tracy concluded her support of the CSLM (Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures)-2 experiment in the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), ending the last of four vacuum venting cycles and preparing the SPU (Sample Processing Unit) for sample processing.      [After configuring the MSG, closing the vacuum vent valves, removing the vacuum hose and connecting the SPU to MSG power/data, Tracy opened the SPU water valve.  The ECU (Electronics Control Unit) in the MSG work volume was then to be powered on by the ground to begin sample processing for the next 48 hours.]
 
  Also in COL, Tracy worked on the MARES (Muscle Atrophy Resistive Exercise System) Rack, going over the rack to confirm the presence and proper installation of a number of bolts at various places.     [After return to Earth of STS-131/19A, a number of loose MARES launch lock-down bolts were found in the Leonardo MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module).  Tracy’s activity today was to verify all bolts currently installed in the rack, which should also ensure that there are no more loose bolts in the MPLM as it is readied for its next launch.]
 
  The six-member crew joined for the important 2-hr Crew Safety Handover (peredacha del po bezopasnosti), to familiarize them with procedures and escape routes in case of an emergency, and to clarify emergency roles &amp; responsibilities.  CDR Skvortsov went through formally listed procedures in discussing the ISS prime to non-prime crew emergency roles &amp; responsibility agreements established during ground training.  A ground specialist tagup wrapped up the obligatory session.     [Safety is of primary concern on board.  Safety Handover includes safety-related items such as (1) emergency actions, equipment and individual crew roles &amp; responsibilities for the four hazard areas (depressurization, fire, ammonia release, non-ammonia toxic release), (2) visiting vehicles docking/undocking, (3) evacuation vehicles, (4) crew life support system status, (5) computers, (6) communications, (7) medical equipment &amp; provisions, (8) stowage, (9) IVA hazards (e.g., sharp edges, protrusions, touch temperatures) and (10) stowage and current hardware status.  Aboard the station are 2 potential sources of Toxic Level 4-chemicals (external thermal loops; Vozdukh) and 7 Tox-2 sources such as Elektron, METOX cans, LiOH cans and batteries.  Prime/non-prime crew roles assignments: the CDR will be responsible for crew headcount; for Fire in the RS (Russian Segment), the three cosmonauts will be prime, i.e. responsible for generally working the response, while Caldwell-Dyson, Wheelock &amp; Walker would stay in their respective Soyuz vehicles or other safe areas; for Rapid Depress, in general Tracy would calculate the all-important T.res (remaining time), Mikhail would manipulate valves &amp; hatches, Alexander would run procedures &amp; coordinate communications; for a Toxic Leak (ammonia), each crewmember is assigned specific tasks in retrieving respirators, detection kits, Sokol suits, go-to locations, etc.  Soyuz vehicle preparations for descent could be required very quickly.]
 
  Alex Skvortsov completed the routine task of shooting two photos of the docking cone of the passive docking assembly (ASP-B) of the SM (Service Module) aft port occupied by the Soyuz TMA-19/23S, a standard practice after Russian dockings.  These images are used to refine current understanding of docking conditions.  Sasha subsequently downlinked the pictures via OCA assets.     [The objective is to take photo imagery of the scratch or scuff marks left by the head of the docking probe on the internal surface of the drogue (docking cone, ASP) ring, now rotated out of the passageway.  Before shooting the picture, the cosmonaut highlights the scuffmark with a marker and writes the date next to it.  As other crewmembers before him, Alex used the Nikon D2X digital still camera to take two pictures with the hatch partially closed.]
 
  Mikhail Kornienko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Later, Misha also performed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems (UOV) in the SM &amp; FGB, cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
 
  The newcomers – Wheelock, Yurchikhin &amp; Walker – went through the mandatory CMS (Countermeasure Systems) overview session to familiarize themselves with the use of the CEVIS cycle ergometer, TVIS &amp; T2 treadmills and ARED exerciser, including location of personal exercise equipment such as ergometer shoes and PCMCIA memory cards.  
 
  Later, Shannon &amp; Wheels also observed Tracy doing her workout on the T2/COLBERT treadmill.
 
  The new crewmembers had several hours set aside for crew onboard orientation and adaptation.     [The first two weeks after their arrival, a new ISS crew will have 1 hour a day to adjust to living in space.  Additional time is also allocated for getting familiar with the – by now – extensive new “home in space” and its research equipment.]
 
  As one of her first scheduled activities onboard, FE-6 Walker performed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops.
 
  Tracy filled out her weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  At ~7:20am EDT, Misha Kornienko held his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
  At ~9:00am, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  At ~10:30am, the entire crew joined in shooting video footage of each other and onboard activities, intended for airing at the traditional Charity Festival at the Windlesham House School (West Sussex, UK), to be held July 3-4, attended by about 1500 students from schools of Great Britain and other countries. This year the festival is called "Odyssey".    [Over the years many students from West Sussex have visited TsUP-Moscow and participated in the International Space Olympics in Korolev.  In 1999, a teleconference linked pupils of West Sussex with the crew of Mir, and in June 2007, the crew of ISS-15, a member of which was Fyodor Yurchikhin, participated in a school festival "Elements".  This year, organizers also plan to participate in the festival ISS.  The crew was asked to record, at high resolution and using a Shure microphone, five scripted subjects, under the motto “Odyssey - let the journey begin!!!”]
 
  FE-4, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 were scheduled for their first PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Fyodor at ~12:06pm, Shannon at ~2:00pm, Wheels at ~3:15pm.
 
  Tracy, Misha &amp; Sasha completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).
