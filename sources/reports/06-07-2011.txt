ISS On-Orbit Status 06/07/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
 
CDR Borisenko began his day with his 3<sup>rd</sup> session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop for the 2h 20m activity.      [Aleksandr Samokutyayev assisted Andrey in donning the electrode cap, preparing his head for the electrodes, and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
Afterwards, Borisenko initiated charging of, to be used in another run of the geophysical GFI-1 Relaksatsiya (relaxation) experiment.
 
After charging the SONY HVR-Z7 camcorder battery, Borisenko installed &amp; started the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 for another run observing Earth’s surface &amp; measuring Earth emission layer radiance in the atmosphere while simultaneously taking video from window #6.  Later, Andrey tagged up with ground specialists for debriefing and dismantled the equipment.      [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka-MV-Kosmos” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and SONY HVR-Z7 HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from windows #9 &amp; #6, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev had another ~2 hrs for troubleshooting the Elektron-VM oxygen generator and attempting startup with both pumps – main &amp; backup – running.  The activity was supported by ground specialist tagup.
 
FE-3 Garan performed the periodic service of the FCF (Fluids Combustion Facility) in the FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack) by changing out the Bio sample on the Bio Base.    [After configuring the US Lab camcorder to cover activities for POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center/Huntsville), Ron opened the lower &amp; upper FCF doors, rotated the LMM SBA (Light Microscopy Module / Spindle Bracket Assembly) from Operate position to Service position, removed the used sample from the Bio Base, returned it to the Bio kit and installed a new sample from Slot 5 in the kit onto the Base.  He then rotated the LMM SBA back to Operate position and closed the rack doors then turned on two switches and notified POIC that FIR was prepared for ground-commanding the RPC (Remote Power Controller).]
 
With the ITCS LTL (Internal Thermal Control System Low Temperature Loop) activated in the US A/L (Airlock) for cooling, Garan set up EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units) 3005 &amp; 3009 with their SCUs (Service &amp; Cooling Umbilicals) and started the standard one-hour scrubbing process on the spacesuits’ cooling water loops, filtering ionic and particulate matter (via a 3-micron filter), followed by reconfiguring the cooling loops and starting the ~2hr biocide filtering. A/L LTL flow was then terminated.  This activity met the periodic maintenance requirements for EMU 3009 and EVA cleanup requirements for EMU 3005.   [Loop scrubbing, incl. iodination of the LCVGs (Liquid Cooling &amp; Ventilation Garments) for biocidal maintenance is done to eliminate any biomass and particulate matter that may have accumulated in the loops.]
 
Also in the A/L, Ron terminated the regeneration of METOX (Metal Oxide) canisters #0015 &amp; #0016, started yesterday, and later initiated the process on METOX cans #0013 &amp; #0022.      [Recyclable METOX canisters replaced the old one-way/expendable LiOH (lithium hydroxide) canisters as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) removal system in the EMU/spacesuits in 2001.  During use, CO<sub>2</sub> is absorbed by them and later removed through a special valve opening by “baking” (heating), which takes place in a special oven in the A/L.]
 
Sasha Samokutyayev had ~4 hrs to perform periodic replacement maintenance on the Russian thermal control system’s heating loop #2 (SOTR KOB-2), removing a replacement unit (BS, blok smennyi) containing an electric pump (ENA/electronasosnyi agregat, electric pump) of the replaceable pump panel 4SPN2 and exchanging it with a spare BS from stowage.  Afterwards, Sasha tested the 4SPN2 pump panel to ascertain its functionality.  Finally, KOB-2 was turned on by Russian ground control.  The activity was supported by ground specialist tagup.     [Each of the two SOTR KOB loops has two redundant pump panels with two redundant ENA pumps each.  While in the early years of Mir and ISS the pumps were integral to the SPN panels, the current design allows them to be replaced via BS without requiring an entire new SPN block.] 
 
Preparatory to the arrival of Soyuz TMA-02M/27S on Thursday (6/9), Garan &amp; Borisenko set up the Ku-band video “scheme” for a communications test of converting the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band from FGB &amp; SM, for downlinking “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.     [Since the wireless SSC-21 (Station Support Computer 21) was not available today, Ron configured the wired SSC-1 T61p laptop in the SM with the NVIEWER application for the test and activated the VWS (Video Streaming Workstation) laptop for both the conversion and the “streaming” MPEG2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoding, with Andrey running the video test from the RS.  The equipment, including the SSC-1, was then closed down.]
 
With SSRMS (Space Station remote Manipulator System) and SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) in position for ULF7, FE-3 powered off the Node-3/Cupola UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) but left the DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) bypass cable connected.
 
Afterwards, Garan changed the labels on a CWC (Contingency Water Container, #1094) in the JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment) from “WPA WW Offload” to “Condensate”.
 
The CDR had ~90 min for auditing/inventorying all onboard GKS SFOG (Solid Fuel Oxygen Generator) candles.    [This activity had been on the Russian voluntary task list up to now.]
 
Ron Garan had another 1h 35m set aside to continue his support of the ongoing SSC laptop transition to/reloading with software v.4 (SSCV4) activities, today focusing on recovering wireless SSCs that ran into loading difficulties yesterday.  Ron’s support consisted of connecting ISL (Integrated OpsLAN) Ethernet cables to the failed SSC Clients and initiating a reload via the LIS (Load Image Server, SSC-10).  The configuration was then to be completed from the ground.     [The loading anomalies resulted from a bad load “ghost” (image) on SSC-7 that propagated to SSC-6, -11, -13, -14, -16, and -20.  The error (missing .dll file) was corrected and SSC-7 was reloaded overnight.]
 
Shortly before sleeptime, Sasha will initiate battery charging for the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware.     [The FSS system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module.]
 
Also before sleep time, Andrey Borisenko will prepare the Russian MBI-12 Sonokard payload and start his 3<sup>rd</sup> experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
At ~6:15am EDT, Ron powered up the amateur radio equipment in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for a ham radio session, at 6:25am, with students at South West College Enniskillen, Enniskillen, North Ireland.
 
CDR &amp; FE-1 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Andrey at ~12:45pm, Sasha at ~2:35pm.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).
 
Jobs listed for Samokutyayev &amp; Borisenko today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Repacking 9 full-size CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) in the RS for transfer to the ATV2 for disposal as per USOS agreement,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur), and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Preparing &amp; downlinking more reportages (text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).</li></ul> 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Bridgetown, Barbados (Capital City - Bridgetown is the capital and largest city of Barbados. The population of the metropolitan area is 96,578 [2006].  Looking slightly right of track.  The city is located on the southwestern coast of the island along Carlisle Bay) and Puyehue Volcano, Chile (Dynamic Event:  After 51 years of inactivity, the Puyehue Volcano erupted on June 4th.  The ash column extended 10 km into the atmosphere.  Satellite imagery indicates that the plume extended eastward over Argentina and into the Atlantic Ocean.  The crew was to concentrate on the ash plume, trying for its point of origin (Puyehue) to as far as it can be detected.  All of this assumes that the ash plume is still as vigorous when ISS passed and that the weather will be good for imagery.  Since it is a dynamic event, and images of erupting volcanoes are very popular with the public and scientists, it is worth the effort.  The volcano is located in central Chile, 800 km south of Santiago).
 
Soyuz TMA-02M/27S:   Countdown is underway for the launch of Soyuz 27S from the Cosmodrome in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, today at 4:12:45pm EDT.   Aboard are Soyuz Commander Sergei Volkov (Russia) and ISS Flight Engineers Mike Fossum (USA) &amp; Satoshi Furukawa (Japan).  Fossum will become ISS CDR for Increment 29 at Increment 28 departure on 9/26.  This is the second flight of an upgraded Soyuz with an improved digital avionics system that is more capable, yet lighter, than the preceding model.  During the mission of the first digital Soyuz, TMA-01M/24S, a software fix became necessary in space after the Neptun InPU-1 (Display Panel #1) performed an uncommanded reboot.  Today’s Soyuz 27S is equipped with new console software.  Contrary to common belief, Russia is continuously upgrading, modernizing &amp; improving the Soyuz spacecraft.  27S docking at the ISS MRM2 Rassvet module is scheduled for ~5:22pm on Thursday (6/9).
