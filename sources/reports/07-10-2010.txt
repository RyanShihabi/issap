ISS On-Orbit Status 07/10/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – crew off-duty.
 
  At wake-up, CDR Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR will inspect the filters again before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, FE-4 Doug Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Shannon Walker continued their current week-long session of the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Tracy’s 5<sup>th</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup> for Wheels &amp; Shannon, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Wheelock &amp; Walker continued their Pro K session with the urine pH spot test after wake-up.
 
  Also before breakfast &amp; exercise, Doug began his monitored diet for his 2<sup>nd</sup> (FD30) Pro K session over the next four days.      [Wheels is free to eat whatever he likes but prepares a diet log, annotating quantities of food packets and drinks consumed and supplements taken during the day.]
 
  Later in the day, Shannon set up the Nutrition/Repository/Pro K hardware for her 24-hr urine collections beginning tomorrow and for Wheelock’s urine collections beginning on 7/13.  Nutrition constraints apply for both as usual. 
 
  The six station residents completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the uborka house cleaning, the Russian crewmembers conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  Alex Skvortsov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.,
 
  Tracy Caldwell-Dyson retrieved the two passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) monitors deployed yesterday by FE-6 in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) at Bay D1, between the air duct return grids.  Their purpose was to catch any formaldehyde exuded by the acoustic foam padding removed later from the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) by Tracy.    [Two monitors are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
  Fyodor Yurchikhin set up pumping equipment, replacing the usual A-R transfer hose with a T2PrU air line, and started the usual bladder compression and leak check of the BV2 Rodnik storage tank of Progress M-06M/38P to get it ready for urine transfer.  Flush water was to be transferred to an EDV or caught in a towel.  38P is docked at the SM aft end, and its BV1 tank was discovered to have a small leak.  The equipment will be torn down before sleeptime, to be used on Progress M-05M/37P Rodnik tank BV1 (docked at DC1 nadir).      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
  At ~10:20am, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
  FE-2, FE-3, FE-4 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Misha at ~7:00am, Tracy at ~8:40am, Wheels at ~11:00am, Shannon at ~12:00pm EDT.
 
  Jobs listed for Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another ~40-min. run of      the GFI-8      "Uragan"      (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D2X digital camera      photography with 800mm telelens (FE-3), and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for      Russia's EKON      Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial      photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X      camera (CDR).</li> </ul> 
  Tracy’s voluntary “job jar” task list today suggested the VO<sub>2</sub>max equipment transfer from the Lab to the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) which she had recommended for.  It will also be hard-scheduled on Monday.
 
 Reboost Planning:   The next ISS reboost, by Progress M-06M/38P, is being planned for 7/16 (Friday), ~4:25am EDT.
