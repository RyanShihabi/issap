ISS On-Orbit Status 07/22/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    
 
 Upon wake-up, CDR Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR will inspect the filters again before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-4 Wheelock supported POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center/Huntsville) in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) on the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) with the startup for the next (sixth) run of the SAME (Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment).    [Later tonight, the MSG will be shut down again.]
 
 FE-6 Walker worked on the US OGS (Oxygen Generator System) to replace the failed H<sub>2</sub> (hydrogen) Dome ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit), followed by removing equipment which provided thermal compliance to allow closing the rack rear.  After installing an older, sized pump, it did not start up, and the crew replaced it with the previously-installed pump.  At the completion of the R&amp;Rs, ground controllers vented the H<sub>2</sub> dome  and began the vent line leak check and standby warm-up.   Specialists expect the system to begin O<sub>2</sub> production later tonight.     [The OGS suffered an unexpected “Fast Shutdown” on 7/5, probably due to blockage in several cells within the H<sub>2</sub> ORU.  Yesterday’s Day 2 activities, by FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, dealt with the forward and reverse flush delayed on Day 1 by an RPCM (Remote Power Controller Module) trip.  The Dome repair should get OGS ready for activation.] 
 
 FE-3 Kornienko &amp; FE-5 Yurchikhin continued their preparations for the Orlan EVA (#25) on 7/26 and the suited training exercise tomorrow (7/23).  Specifically, Mikhail &amp; Fyodor –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Performed pressure checks on the portable O<sub>2</sub> tanks (BK-3) and portable air repress bottles (BNP), including the additional BNP in the DC1,</li><li>Conducted BRTA (radio telemetry unit) checkouts for the Orlans &amp; BSS interface units,</li><li>Set up Orlan BRTK “Korona” comm configuration, ran voice checks and tested medical parameter acquisition of the BETA-08 ECG (electrocardiograph) harnesses with the “Gamma-1M” med complex from the PKO med exam panel for vital signs &amp; equipment monitoring,</li><li>Installed US EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) equipment (lights, wireless video camera) on the Orlan-M suits,</li><li>Installed Orlan attached hardware (OTA) plus taking photos of the outfitted Orlans for downlink (OTA equipment includes: right-hand swing arm with tool caddy, small trash bag, wire ties, tethers, camera, wrench and cutters),</li><li>Prepared auxiliary NASA equipment to be used in Orlan plus taking photos of the outfitted Orlans for downlink,</li><li>Filled the DIDBs (disposable in-suit drink bags) and installed them in the suits,</li><li>Unstowed EVA emergency first-aid medical packs and stowed them in the DC1, and</li><li>Tested the proper function of the hatch pressure equalization valve (PEV; Russian: KVD) from the POV panels in the SM PkhO (Service Module Transfer Compartment) and DC1.</li> </ul> 
 On Monday, a data dump was performed to test capability to send Russian data through the US-23 unit via US assets to TsUP-Moscow.  The test was successful, but the Orlan wasn’t activated at the time, so no Orlan data were included in the data stream.  Today they repeated the data dump while the Orlan suits were activated allowing TsUP specialists to see real-time Orlan data on their displays for the first time through US assets.  Preliminary results for this test were also nominal.
 
 Joined by Doug Wheelock, the designated IVA (intravehicular) crewmember, Kornienko &amp; Yurchikhin spent about an hour reviewing the uplinked EVA (VKD) flight procedures material.  Earlier, Misha &amp; Fyodor reviewed special spacewalk procedures and discussed them with a VKD expert on the ground.
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson set up the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware, configured yesterday by Shannon, including MBS (Mixing Bag System), powered it up and then spent several hours performing her 4<sup>th</sup> session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, integrated with Thermolab.  Later, she downloaded the data, including Thermolab, to a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop, powered down, cleaned up and temporarily moved all hardware aside for subsequent crew operation.     [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
 In the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-2 serviced the CGSE (Common Gas Support Equipment) by shutting off the AR (Argon) gas supply at the upper AR GBU (Gas Bottle Unit).
 
 While in the JPM, Tracy restowed A31p laptop equipment (120Vdc power supply plus US dc power &amp; 1553 data cable from UOP/Utility Outlet Panel to power supply) that had been mistakenly deployed.
 
 Caldwell-Dyson completed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (24-0007D) lists 125 CWCs (2,933.8 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (27 CWCs with 1,127.6 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 712.7 L in 17 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 129.4 L in 3 bags still requiring sample analysis, 128.3 L in 3 bags for flushing only with microbial filter, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only; 2. potable water (5 CWCs with 215.4 L, of which 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 1 bag with 42.5 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use;  3. iodinated water (84 CWCs with 1,550.1 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (1 bag with 20.5 L to be used with microbial filter &amp; 6 empty bags; and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (1 CWC with 20.2 L &amp; 1 empty bag).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 Tracy also filled out her weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 In Japan’s JPM, FE-4 Wheelock took commercial photography of a “Leaveanest Seed” package, delivered in ULF-4, in front of the unshuttered science window.
 
 Also in Kibo, Wheels reconfigured the manual valves of the gas trap of the JPM TCA L (Thermal Control Assembly for Low Temperature Loop) for operation, and then activated the heater for the gas trap.  Later, FE-4 turned off the heater and set the valves for the nominal (bypassed) configuration.
 
 In the Lab, Doug mated MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) umbilicals.
 
 Continuing his preparations for the US EVA-15 on 8/5, FE-4 Wheelock –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>“Degassed” EMU PWR (Payload Water Reservoir) #1023,</li><li>Topped off the water supply in EMUs 3005 (EV-1) &amp; 3009 (EV-2) as well as in PWR #1023 and CWC (Contingency Water Container) #1059,</li><li>Terminated recharge of the second round of EVA batteries in the BSA (Battery Recharge Assembly), and</li><li>Readied &amp; checked out three PGTs (Pistol Grip Tools), including installing battery 1004 in PGT 04, battery 1006 in PGT 06, and battery 1008 in PGT 01. </li></ul> 
 Walker set up the SLM (Sound Level Meter) and performed the periodic extensive 1h10m acoustic survey which is required once every two months in all ISS modules.  The subsequent data download to the MEC was a separate timeline activity.    [There were 36 measurements (6 locations @ 6 readings) in Node-2, nine measurement locations in Node-3.]
 
 In the SM, Alex Skvortsov had ~4 hrs to dismantle and stow two US-21 matching units (#077 &amp; #115).
 
 Afterwards, the CDR performed another sun-glint observation session with the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) experiment from SM window #9, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with a coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloading the data to laptop RSE1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.  Video footage was also taken, using the SONY HVR-Z7E camcorder in auto mode.     [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.]
 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Sasha completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
 At ~2:30pm EDT (instead of yesterday), Shannon Walker had her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-4), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.] 
 
 For her exercise session on the T2 treadmill, Shannon donned the Glenn treadmill harness with installed transducer instrumentation, then activated the harness for her first session of the SDTO (Station Development Test Objective).     [Afterwards, FE-6 downloaded the harness data (including achieved “body weight”) and filled out a survey questionnaire to complete the SDTO (Station Development Test Objective).]
 
 Conjunction Alert:    Flight controllers are tracking a conjunction with a piece of a Chinese satellite.  The TCA (Time of Closest Approach) is tomorrow (7/23) at 6:09pm EDT.   A valid PC (Probability of Collision) number was expected at ~12:00 pm EDT today.  This debris is being tracked as a medium concern
 
 CEO photo targets uplinked for today were Lake Nasser, Toshka Lakes, Egypt (the Toshka Lakes formed in the late 1990’s when record high water in the Nile River and Lake Nasser spilled out into desert depressions to the west.  Since then the lakes have persisted, but continue to slowly dry up.  The crew was asked to update CEO observers’ monitoring record of this event with oblique context views of the lakes.  Looking for them near nadir as ISS tracked along the Nile River valley from the southwest.  It was mid-morning with clear weather expected), Athens, Greece (the capital of Greece is an ancient city that dominates the south coast of region known as Attica, in the southeastern part of the mainland.  ISS had a mid-morning pass in fair weather over this sprawling urban area of more than 3 million.  As ISS tracked over southern Greece from the southwest, looking just left of track for this target below), Algiers, Algeria (the Algerian capital is located on the Mediterranean coast of this north-African nation.  On this mid-morning pass tracking over the sea, looking just right track for this target.  With a population of 2 to 3 million, the city is also known as "Algiers the White" due to its abundance of white buildings.  Short lens views of the urban area and surroundings provide context for higher resolution imagery), San Marino, San Marino (this tiny capital city of the European microstate of the Most Serene Republic of San Marino has a population of about 4,500.  The Republic itself is land-locked and located on the eastern edge of the Apennine Mountains of north-central Italy, less than 20 miles from the coast of the Adriatic Sea.  ISS had a fair-weather pass in late morning offering nadir views of this target.  As the crew tracked northeastward toward the coast, they were to try for detailed mapping views to acquire this challenging target), Mount St. Helens, WA (ISS had a late morning, fair-weather pass with a near-nadir view of this famous stratovolcano located in the Cascade Range of southern Washington.  Evidence of the explosive eruption of 1980 is still visible today.  As the crew tracked northeastward toward the forest-covered slopes of the Cascades, they were to look for this large, western-most peak and acquire detailed views of the summit area), and West Hawk Impact Crater, Manitoba (ISS had a fair-weather pass at mid-afternoon light for this target.  Approach was from the west-west.  This impact is marked by a ragged, circular lake about 40 miles north of the northwest edge of Lake of The Woods.  CEO observers are seeking details with the long lens settings.  After passing over the city of Winnipeg, the crew was to begin looking just right of track and try for overlapping views of impact area).
