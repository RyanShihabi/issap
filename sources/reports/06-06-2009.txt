ISS On-Orbit Status 06/06/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – light-duty day for CDR Gennady Padalka (Russia), FE-1 Michael Barratt (USA), FE-2 Koichi Wakata (Japan), FE-3 Roman Romanenko (Russia), FE-4 Robert Thirsk (Canada), FE-5 Frank DeWinne (Belgium).  After yesterday’s Orlan EVA-22, the crew is back on regular sleep/wake cycle.
 
  FE-4 &amp; FE-5 continued their first session of sleep logging for the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a 7-day-long session.     [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, Bob &amp; Frank wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, and they use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Romanenko, Thirsk &amp; DeWinne began their workday before breakfast with the periodic session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement, using the IM mass measurement device, which Romanenko then stowed away again.  First time for all three.   [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IM "scales" measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed.]
 
  Bob Thirsk &amp; Frank DeWinne began the second day of their session with the NASA/JSC experiment NUTRITION w/Repository, after the 8-hr overnight fast.    [This was an all-day session, the first for both, of urine sample collections for both several times until termination tomorrow after 24 hrs.  DeWinne also assisted the FE-4 in his blood draw.  Frank’s phlebotomy (blood sample collection) from an arm vein is scheduled tomorrow.  The NUTRITION project is the most comprehensive in-flight study done by NASA to date of human physiologic changes during long-duration space flight.  It includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, nutritional assessments, and hormonal changes, expanding the previous Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) testing in three ways: Addition of in-flight blood &amp; urine collection (made possible by supercold MELFI dewars), normative markers of nutritional assessment, and a return session plus 30-day (R+30) session to allow evaluation of post-flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation.]
 
  Romanenko performed another inspection of the 4GB4 Hydraulic Unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for presence of coolant.    [On 5/19, the CDR had replaced a pump unit of the 4SPN1 replaceable pump panel at this location.]
 
  Padalka &amp; Barratt cleaned up after the EVA-22 spacewalk and prepared the Orlan-MKs #5 &amp; #6 for EVA-23 (6/10).  Specifically, Gennady &amp; Mike –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Removed the BK-3 portable oxygen      repressurization tanks (primary &amp; backup) from the DC1 BSS (Orlan      Interface Unit),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Repressurized the interior from      the BNP portable repress tank #7 in the DC1 until empty,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Removed the BNP portable repress      tank from the SM Work Compartment (RO) and stowed it,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Removed the Orlan BRTA      radio/telemetry unit batteries, </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Took post-EVA radiation readings      of the “Pille-MKS” dosimeters carried by the spacewalkers in      their Orlan suits,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Put the EVA medical kits back in      storage, </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Downlinked EVA-22 digital      photography, </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Set up the first 825M3 Orlan      battery for complete discharge/recharge,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Removed the US EMU      (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) lights, video camera, REBA battery &amp;      electric power cable from MK #6, plus the Kapton tape from the REBA      activation strap,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Searched for a checkout panel      (PKO-M 2AK-7205-00-01),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Refilled the water tanks as      required, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Configured the Orlan-MK suits for      drying out.</li> </ul> 
  For his VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) program, FE-2 Wakata set up the High Definition TV gear (G1 camcorder, MPC/Multipurpose Converter, IPU/Image Processing Unit) in the Kibo module with tools &amp; materials for recording the third session with the JAXA “Try Zero-G” experiment, and then conducted the demo “Twosome” in two parts, with and without fan.  Afterwards, the equipment was disassembled and stowed.
 
  At ~9:00am EDT, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  Barratt &amp; Wakata also filled out their regular weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Mike’s ninth, Koichi’s 12<sup>th</sup>.    [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  Bob Thirsk completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and File Server SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops.
 
  Roman Romanenko performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, today also including the cleaning of the BMP fan grille.
 
  With the TVIS treadmill currently out of service (see Note below), Padalka &amp; Romanenko were advised by TsUP/Moscow to use a contingency Russian device for physical exercise, the NS-1 Expander, on a daily basis until the TVIS is restored.    [Uplinked material included detailed instructions with pictures on the use of the simple body-stretch device.]
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), ARED (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), NS-1 Expander (FE-3), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-3).
 
  Later, Bob transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
  
  At ~3:50am, Wakata powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and conducted, at 3:55am, another ham radio exchange in Japanese with students at the Kawanishi Seiwadai Community Center, Hyogo, Japan.    [Kawanishi City is in the residential suburbs that still “has wonderful nature”.  The history of Kawanishi City is very old.  A lot of historical shrines and culture still exists.  The community center was established as an exchanging place in 1987.  It is put to practical use for regional peoples exchanging place through sports and culture.]
 
 TVIS Update:   Wakata’s IFM (Inflight Maintenance) yesterday on the forward right stabilizer (S4) of the treadmill exercise machine showed that the heads are sheared off four fasteners on a nut plate and the spring is broken, allowing the nut plate to become free floating.  No damage was observed on the other three springs and nut plates, and the fastener heads were found on the stabilizer magnet and removed.  The nut plate and broken spring were also removed, the cover was replaced, and the S4 stabilizer was re-installed on TVIS.  In the aft right stabilizer (S3) no damage was found.  Koichi took photo and hi-definition video imagery of both stabilizers, which was downlinked last night.  TVIS engineers are reviewing the imagery, and will make a Go/No-Go recommendation for a TVIS ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout) session.  The FE-2 has agreed to conduct the ACO session tomorrow, tentatively planned for 6:00am EDT.
