<!--Promo date and doctitle ends-->
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – light-duty day for CDR Fincke, FE-1 Lonchakov &amp; FE-2 Magnus. 
 
 With wake period to the right by 2 hrs this morning (3:00am – 6:30pm), the crew started a new sleep cycle shift protocol to adjust to the requirements of the Mission 15A docked period next week (see Wake/Sleep Schedule, below, based on a nominal STS-119 launch on 3/11).
 
 CDR Fincke started the day with the daily download of the accumulated data of the SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) experiment from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of another week-long session with SLEEP, his third.     [To monitor the crewmember's sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment's laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days, as part of the crew's discretionary “job jar” task list.]
 
 FE-2 Magnus began the second day of her FD120 (Flight Day 120) session with the NASA/JSC experiment NUTRITION w/Repository, after the overnight 8-hr fast.  This was an all-day session, the fifth for Sandy, of collecting blood samples (assisted by Mike Fincke) plus urine samples several times until termination tomorrow after 24 hrs.    [The NUTRITION project is the most comprehensive in-flight study done by NASA to date of human physiologic changes during long-duration space flight.  It includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, nutritional assessments, and hormonal changes, expanding the previous Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) testing in three ways: Addition of in-flight blood &amp; urine collection (made possible by supercold MELFI dewars), normative markers of nutritional assessment, and a return session plus 30-day (R+30) session to allow evaluation of post-flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation.] 
 
 Fincke &amp; FE-1Lonchakov continued EVA preparations in the DC1 (Docking Compartment), including –
 
 <ul><li>Reviewing specific EVA procedures for several hours;  <li>Preparing EVA gear, consolidating take-out equipment bundles, shooting documentary photo/video for ground review and tagging up with ground specialists;  <li>Configuring the emergency medical kits in the DC1  [comprising the NP-2 First Aid Kit 2, SS Cardiovascular Remedies Kit and AB Onboard First Aid Kit from the Soyuz 13S];  <li>Readying CCPKs (Crew Contamination Protection Kits, Russian: PNST) in the DC1, for protecting the spacewalkers from FORP (Fuel/Oxidizer Reaction Products, e.g., N-nitrosodimethylamine, NDMA), i.e., incompletely-burnt fuel residue on the SM hull from yaw/pitch thruster plumes  [protective gear kits for use during and after the EVA in case the Orlans are inadvertently contaminated, are extensively equipped with wet wipes, dry towels, goggles, IPK gas masks and half masks, latex gloves, high performance filters, trash containers, etc.  Towels used for wiping gloves etc. will not be thrown overboard but attached to handrails]; and  <li>Installing the usual additional BNP portable air repress bottle in the DC1 (to support a DC1 repress in the event of a failure of the DC1/PkhO hatch's pressure equalization valve)  [the regular BNP bottle is already installed in the repress line of the SM's work compartment (RO).]

 Continuing her preparations for the 15A spacewalks, the FE-2 set up the REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery), EHIP (EMU Helmet Interchangeable Portable) light, PGT (Pistol Grip Tool) and EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) batteries in the Airlock BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly) for recharging.    [This is the first of two recharges required to prepare all EVA batteries for 15A.]
 
 For this weekend's planned VolSci (Voluntary Science) program, the crew had selected an EPO (Education Payload Operations) Renovation Demo, to create an educational video demonstration discussing the recent renovations that have occurred on the ISS and their preparations for six crewmembers.  Sandy Magnus today reviewed the activity and set up the camcorder for conducting the demo tomorrow.
 
 Mike Fincke completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and File Server SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops.
 
 Sandra Magnus took documentary photography of the LOCAD-PTS (Lab-on-a-Chip Application Development-Portable Test System) Phase 1 media slides from her last session on 3/4 for any culture growths.
 
 The FE-2 also completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.] 
 
 Yuri Lonchakov performed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems in the SM and FGB by cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting the POTOK in automatic mode.
 
 The station residents completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR, FE-2), TVIS treadmill (FE-1/2.5h) and ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2).
 
 At ~8:45am EST, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
 At ~2:40pm, the FE-2 has her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
 At ~5:00pm, the crew is scheduled to tag up with the STS-119 crew for a teleconference.
 
 Working off the Russian discretionary “time permitting” suggestions list, the FE-1 conducted another session for Russia's Environmental Safety Agency (EKON), making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on earth using the Nikon D2X with the SIGMA 300-800mm telephoto lens.
 
 A second periodic task from the voluntary work list for Yuri called for another session of the Russian "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program, using the Nikon D1X digital camera with 400 &amp; 800 mm focal length lenses to take pictures of natural environment targets, including those showing man-made impacts on nature.     [Photo targets were the glaciers of the Patagonia southern and northern ice fields.]

 EVA-21A Timeline Preview:  The Orlan EVA-21A by Lonchakov (EV1) &amp; Fincke (EV2) on 3/10 begins at ~12:20pm EDT (DC1 EV hatch open), to last an estimated 5 hrs 45 min, i.e., concluding at approximately 5:05pm.  Russian attitude thrusters will be inhibited by TsUP ground commanding at specific times when the spacewalkers work on the SM RO (Working Compartment, l.d.) and SM AO (Assembly Compartment).  Objectives of the EVA (all fallen off the previous EVA-21 timeline) are –
 <p> <ul><p><li>Mount the EXPOSE-R hardware on the URM-D (Portable Multipurpose Workstation) on the SM RO l.d., connect it to the PF-3 connector patch panel and remove protective cover;  <li><p>Photograph the URM-D with EXPOSE-R monoblock &amp; cables, ROBOTIC hardware, IPI-SM hardware and routed cables;  <li><p>Remove fasteners (Aramide straps) in the installation areas of the docking target and AR-VKA &amp; 2AR-VKA antennas on DC1;  <li><p>Close MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) flap on the SM PF-10 connector patch panel;  <li><p>Re-install SKK #9 removable cassette container in nominal position on SM;  <li><p>Inspect &amp; photograph Progress antenna ASF1-M-VKA from DC handrail 3034; and  <li><p>Inspect &amp; photograph conditions of ISS RS exterior &amp; structural elements (“Panorama-2009” DTO).  </p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></p></li></li></p></ul> <p> <p>
