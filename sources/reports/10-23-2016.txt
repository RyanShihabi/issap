Cygnus Rendezvous and Capture:  This morning the crew monitored the Cygnus approach from the Cupola Robotic Workstation and successfully captured Cygnus using the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) at 6:28 am CDT.  The Ground Robotics team maneuvered Cygnus into position to inspect the Passive Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM), and berthed Cygnus onto the Node-1 Nadir Active CBM.  Later, the crew removed the Centerline Berthing Camera System (CBCS) from the Node-1 Nadir hatch window.  The crew performed a leak check and configured the vestibule for ingress.  Controller Panel Assembly (CPA) removal and hatch opening/ingress are scheduled for Thursday, October 27th.
Crew Quarters (CQ) 9 Volt Battery Changeout:  Today, the crew replaced the 9 volt batteries in all four CQs. This maintenance is required every twelve months. These batteries are used to power the Caution & Warning (C&W) alarm speakers and the Egress Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs).
