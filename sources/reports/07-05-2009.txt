ISS On-Orbit Status 07/05/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Sunday – off-duty day.  100<sup>th</sup> day in space for Gennady Padalka &amp; Mike Barratt.   Ahead:  Week 6 of Increment 20.  
 
  Upon wakeup, FE-1 Barratt, FE-4 Thirsk &amp; FE-5 DeWinne continued their current session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), logging data from their Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a week-long session.    [To monitor the crewmember’s sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  FE-3 Romanenko performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.  
 
  Roman also checked up on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP-Moscow.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 &amp; FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) scheduled, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Frank at ~6:00am, Bob at ~3:40pm, Mike at ~4:35pm, Koichi at ~5:10pm EDT.
 
  A new job on the US voluntary “job jar” task list was for Mike &amp; Koichi to retrieve an EVA drop-proof tether adapter and a socket caddy from stowage in the Airlock and secure them in a temporary mesh bag for use during the 2J/A spacewalks.
 
  As a second new “job jar” task, FE-1 &amp; FE-2 were to configure an EVA wire-tie caddy with remaining “pristine” long wire ties and then stow the caddy in the temporary bag.
 
  Working from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, Gennady was to conduct another run for Russia's Environmental Safety Agency (EKON), making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on earth using the Nikon D2X with the SIGMA 300-800mm telephoto lens.
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-4, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-3), RED resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5) and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-2).      [The interim RED is being used in lieu of the ARED (Advanced RED) until the latter has had its damaged VIS (Vibration Isolation System) dashpot replaced and can be put back in service.]
 
 COL ppO<sub>2</sub> Sensor:   Due to increased differences to MCA (Major Constituents Analyzer) measurements, the ppO<sub>2</sub> (oxygen partial pressure) sensor in the Columbus laboratory is no longer considered reliable and is not being used anymore.  The backup ppO<sub>2</sub> sensor is still in range with the reference and gives good readings of the oxygen situation in COL.
 
  No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today due to the short workday.
 
  CEO photography can be studied at this “Gateway” website:
