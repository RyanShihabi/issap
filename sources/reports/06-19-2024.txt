Genes in Space Molecular Operations and Sequencing (GiSMOS): The Biomolecule Sequencer was stowed and the flow cell sample was trashed. This completes Run 2 Part 2 of GiSMOS DNA sample sequencing operations. More information on this experiment can be found here.
Systems:
Lab Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) Bed 202 Remove & Replace (R&R) & Cleaning:The crew completed activities to R&R the Lab CDRA Bed. The crew then began cleaning the old CDRA Bed 202 by preparing a new filter screen, filter cover, and adsorbent bed, performing a cover filter R&R, and reassembling and stowing the CDRA Bed to prepare for more cleaning operations tomorrow.
Bigelow Expandable Aerospace Module (BEAM) Operations: The crew ingressed the BEAM to perform a variety of activities with the BEAM hatch open. They performed various stowage operations, including the retrieval of the Rate Gyro Enclosure for the upcoming Radio Frequency Group (RFG) Retrieval Part 2.5 EVA. They also did Distributed Impact Detection System (DIDS) Cable Troubleshooting and microbial air and surface sampling.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation Operations: The crew performed various activities in preparation for the two upcoming EVAs. The crew completed an EVA Procedure Review & Conference, a Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly (REBA) Installation, and Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) Operations. These activities are in preparation for the upcoming RFG Retrieval Part 2.5 EVA on June 24th and the Common Communications for Visiting Vehicle (C2V2), Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA), and DC-DC Converter Unit (DDCU) (CARD) EVA on July 2nd.
