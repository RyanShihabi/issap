Extravehicular Activity (EVA) 29:  Wilmore and Virts accomplished all International Docking Adapter (IDA) Cable Deploy objectives associated with EVA 29 within a Phased Elapsed Time (PET) of 6 hours 41 minutes.  Cristoforetti and Shkaplerov assisted during suit donning and doffing activities.  Joint Airlock egress took place at 6:45am CST and post EVA ingress and hatch closure occurring at 1:17pm CST.  The EVA did not require Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) task support, although ground commanded SSRMS cameras views were available through the day.  The objectives accomplished during today’s EVA are as follows:

PMA2 Port Umbilical Re-route
Install IDA Cables under Port and Starboard Shields
Deploy IDA Cables from PMA-2 to the Lab Forward End Cone
Get ahead task: EVA Inhibits for IDA 1 Cables – Partially completed

Astro Palate:  On Friday, Virts retrieved a special Astro Palate prepackaged meal, consumed it as his midday meal and then completed the Mood and Food Consumption/Satisfaction Questionnaires.  Factors Contributing to Food Acceptability and Consumption, Mood and Stress on Long-Term Space Missions (Astro Palate) studies the relationship among emotions, mood, stress and eating during spaceflight. The study explores ways to minimize stressful aspects of the eating situation so that individuals consume more food and are more satisfied with it. Additionally, the experiment examines ways to use the eating itself to reduce the stress or negative moods that crewmembers might normally experience in flight.
