ISS On-Orbit Status 02/22/11
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      
 
 FE-4 Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg Skripochka will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 All crewmembers conducted the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement, using the IMT mass measurement device set up by Skripochka who later stowed it away again.  In addition to MO-8, the three Russian crewmembers, Oleg, Sasha &amp; Dima, also completed the PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement protocol.      [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ]
 
 FE-5 Paolo Nespoli completed Day 6 of Session 2 of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment which entailed diet intake loggings (low salt diet), body mass measurements and blood &amp; urine samplings.  Today’s activities involved final urine sampling after the 24-hr collections plus securing the samples in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), and BMM (Body Mass Measurement) with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device).      [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Paolo ingested special diet meals (Session 1 – High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level, Session 2 – Low salt diet.  SOLO Diet started with breakfast on Day 1.  Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD on Days 4 &amp; 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged &amp; inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
 Nespoli also downloaded and saved the ECG (electrocardiogram) data recorded for the last 24 hrs from his 2<sup>nd</sup> session (of 3 total) with the JAXA biomedical experiment BIORHYTHMS, for which he donned the electrodes of the DWH (Digital Walk Holter) for ECG recording yesterday for 24 hrs.
 
 Before breakfast &amp; first exercise, Kaleri, Skripochka, Kondratyev &amp; Nespoli each took a full session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis.  Afterwards, Oleg closed out and stowed the Urolux hardware.      [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).]
 
 Paolo undertook a session with the U.S. PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol as subject, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on BP (blood pressure) &amp; ECG during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with the BP/ECG equipment and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.  Scott Kelly assisted as Operator/CMO (Crew Medical Officer).      [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.] 
 
 FE-1 Kaleri &amp; FE-2 Skripochka conducted a session each of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (“Study of<a name="_Toc416143806"></a><a name="_Toc416143862"></a><a name="_Toc416144063"></a> the Veins in the Lower Extremities”), using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex with orthogonal leads which Oleg Kotov had installed in the SM in February 2010.  It was Oleg’s 3<sup>rd</sup>, Sasha’s 4<sup>th</sup> session with MO-12.      [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Alex set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump &amp; valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a “body box”) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).]
 
 Later in the day, Kondratyev &amp; Skripochka also undertook the periodic (generally monthly) health test with the cardiological experiment PZEh MO-1 (“Study of the Bioelectric Activity of the Heart at Rest”) on exercise equipment, Dmitri’s first &amp; Oleg’s 4<sup>th</sup> session.       [Equipment used was VPG/Temporal Pulsogram and 8-channel ECG/Electrocardiogram Data Output Devices (USI).  The test took place during an RGS (Russian Groundsite) overflight window (~10:24am EST) via VHF for data downlink from the VPG and Gamma-1M ECG for about 5-6 minutes.]
 
 Kelly, Nespoli &amp; Coleman, with the help of Kondratyev, worked several hours on swapping MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2) and MELFI-3, by first demating the racks, then moving MELFI-2 from the US Lab (loc. S1) to JPM (JEM Pressurized Module, loc. A1), with temporary hold in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), and MELFI-3 from JPM (A1) to the Lab (S1), finally reconnecting the racks a their new positions.  Activities were monitored via video camera configured by Cady in the Lab.     [This swap results in both functioning MELFI-1 &amp; MELFI-3 being located in the Lab, on separate power loops for fault tolerance.] 
 
 Alex &amp; Dmitri had ~2.5 hrs set aside for an in-depth review of uplinked procedures for the upcoming major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of removing the BOA Atmosphere Purification Unit, main component of the Vozdukh carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) removal system in the SM (Service Module), and replacing it with a new spare.     [R&amp;R activities are scheduled to begin on 2/28 with hardware &amp; worksite setup plus Vozdukh leak check.  The actual replacement steps will take place on 3/1, 3/2 and 3/3, requiring repeated shutdown of Vozdukh and of the Elektron oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) generator.]
 
 FE-6 Coleman conducted a wiring test of the Ku-band power supply.     [Engineers have discovered errors in the engineering schematics for the Ku-band power supply which may result in feeding 120V DC power to the 28 V DC output connector.  With today’s test, Cady was to measures resistance between input and output connectors to determine if the Ku-band power supply is built correctly.]
 
 Preparatory to the arrival of ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) “Johannes Kepler” on 2/24 (Thursday), Coleman &amp; Skripochka set up the Ku-band video “scheme” for a communications test of converting the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band from FGB &amp; SM, for downlinking “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.     [For the test, Cady configured the SSC-1 (Station Support Computer 1) A31p laptop in the FGB with the NViewer application for MPEG2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) monitor-viewing, and the Simvol-Ts LIV television system (converter &amp; monitor) for both the conversion and the “streaming” MPEG2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoding was activated by the automated “Daily Flight Program” sequencer, for Oleg to run the video test from the RS.  The equipment was then closed down.]
 
 For an ATV pre-docking communications test, Paolo was scheduled for a quick call from the ATV Control Center in Toulouse/France at ~2:00 pm EST, to make sure that everything is ready for rendezvous day (where a similar check will be repeated).
 
 CDR Kelly. FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman got together for a one-hour review of next week’s STS-133/ULF5 activities, studying and discussing three uplinked documents,-  the ISS-ULF5 Timeline Walkthrough, the Summary Crew Timeline, and an overview of the ISS-ULF5 Flight Plan,- followed by a 30-min audio conference with ground specialists.
 
 Working briefly in Node-3 on the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System 2) at loc. D4, FE-6 inspected and photographed the WRS-2 door in its final configuration.     [Activities included verifying that the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) vent is visible and that there are no gaps around the perimeter of WRS2 between door and rack, then taking close-up documentary digital photography.]
 
 Scott had ~1h set aside for restowing remaining US tools used during the RS EVA-28 and for configuring/auditing EVA tools that will be required for ULF5.
 
 Later, the CDR performed the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose, followed by the periodic changeout of the TOCA WWB  (Waste Water Bag).      [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.]
 
 Scott also installed the four CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) alignment guides to protect the PaRIS (Passive Rack isolation System) against disturbances. 
 
 After yesterday’s replacement of the sampler &amp; separator of the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Separator, Alex &amp; Oleg today again collected condensate water samples (KAV) from upstream of the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit, for comparison.  The sampling equipment was then disassembled and discarded.
 
 Working in the US A/L (Airlock), Paolo Nespoli performed regular EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) maintenance on LCVG (Liquid Cooling Ventilation Garment) #3211, to be used a backup for Mission Specialist-2 Steve Bowen during ULF5, by filling the LCVG with water.     [Later, the EMU (#3011) was to be bundled for its eventual transfer to the JPM.]
 
 Also in the A/L, Cady Coleman initiated recharge in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly) on EVA batteries used during the recent Russian spacewalk (EVA-28).
 
 Later, Cady performed routine maintenance on the CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) prime unit (#1058) by replacing its battery with a new one, then zero-calibrating all units.    [CSA-CP is a passive cabin atmosphere monitor that provides quick response capability during a combustion event (fire). Its collected data are stored on a logger. Following zero calibration, the prime unit was re-deployed at the SM Central Post.]
 
 Scott Kelly used the G1 video camcorder for shooting a ~20-min tour of the US Airlock for subsequent downlink and immediate review by the STS-133 at KSC for familiarization.  Additional areas to be recorded by Scott were COL (overview &amp; F2 prepack location), JPM (overview) and Node-2 (forward, overhead, and deck ports).
 
 Early in the morning, the CDR set up the video camera in Node-3 to cover the workout sessions of himself, Oleg, Paolo &amp; Cady on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), to meet the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.
 
 At ~3:15am, 3:30am &amp; 4:40am, Alex, Dmitri &amp; Oleg each had an exercise-related PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, discussing workout issues with exercise specialists.
 
 FE-1, FE-2, FE-4 &amp; FE-5 had their standard PMCs, Paolo at ~7:30am, Sasha at ~9:15am, Oleg at ~9:45am, Dima at ~11:00am EST.
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1/2x, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4)..      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
