ISS On-Orbit Status 09/14/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.       
 
Crew Wake/Sleep cycle shift:   To accommodate Soyuz 26S undock tomorrow evening at 8:37pm EDT, crew wake/sleep cycle changes go into effect, featuring a late turn-in today and tomorrow, plus an “all-sleep” Saturday:
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Wake – 2:00am (today),
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Sleep – 8:00pm (today);
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Wake – 9:00am (tomorrow morning, 9/15);
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Sleep – 1:00am (Friday, 9/16);
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Wake – 8:00pm (Friday, 9/16);
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Free Saturday until 2:00am Sunday (9/18), then back to regular).
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection,
 
At wake-up, FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Furukawa &amp; FE-6 Fossum completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking &amp; brushing teeth, Garan, Fossum &amp; Furukawa performed another liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 4), followed today by dry saliva sample collections.  Later in the day, Ron, Mike &amp; Satoshi also completed the IMMUNE blood sample draws, with FE-6 Fossum assisting Ron as Operator and vice versa, plus Mike assisting Satoshi as Operator.  FE-5 completed the Integrated Immune Health Survey and emailed the file to the PI (Principal Investigator).  Following the blood draws, the full blood tubes were temp stowed in the blood collection kit until tomorrow when they will be packed together with the saliva samples on the Soyuz for return to ground.            [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
During Daily Morning Inspection, CDR Borisenko conducted the routine checkup of the circuit breakers &amp; fuses in the MRM2 Poisk module.      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 &amp; MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.  MRM2 &amp; MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.]
 
FE-4 Volkov completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  Sergei will terminate the process at ~4:35pm EDT.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday.  (Done last: 8/24 &amp; 8/25).      [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.]
 
In preparation for tomorrow’s undocking, FE-1 Alexandr Samokutyayev –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2">Worked in the 26S spacecraft’s Orbital Module (BO), disconnecting &amp; taking out the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit, for stowage and recycling in a future vehicle,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2">Will check out &amp; maintain communications from 26S with the ground using RGS (Russian Groundsite) VHF,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2">Spent another 2h30m on loading &amp; packing return cargo in the 26S Descent Module (SA), assisting crewmate Garan in loading US return cargo, and packing excessed cargo &amp; trash in the Orbital Module (BO), and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2">Used the standard ECOSFERA equipment to conduct Stage 2 of the microbial air sampling runs for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment, with the POTOK Air Purification System temporarily powered down, taking Kit 2 samples from cabin surfaces along with samples from crewmembers for sanitation and disease studies.  The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container and subsequently packed in Kit #А21 for return in Soyuz 26S.  Stage 1 of MO-21 protocol was done yesterday, including overnight;  [the equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge, the sample collection was performed in two stages.  After today‘s sampling, the ECOSFERA battery pack is being recharged overnight for tomorrow’s Stage 2 for sampling to Kit #А21 Petri dishes.]</li></ul> 
Borisenko conducted the MO-22 Sanitary-Epidemiological Status check, part of the Russian MedOps program done on structures and crewmembers usually before Soyuz departures.     [To monitor for microflora, Andrey collected samples from surface areas of interior panels and hardware at 24 locations in the SM, FGB, MRM1, MRM2, DC1 and ATV2, also from himself and FE-4 Volkov using cotton swabs and special test tubes which were then stowed in 26S for return to the ground.]
 
Volkov configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 4<sup>th</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
The CDR &amp; FE-1 each conducted another data collection session for the psychological program MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”), accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was the 13<sup>th</sup> and final MBI-16 session for both of them.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Andrey Borisenko performed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.       [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
Andrey also removed, photographed &amp; transferred the following Russian payloads to Soyuz 26S for return:
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3">BTKh-29 Zhenshen-2 (Ginseng-2) in its Bioecology container from MRM2,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;text-autospace:none">BTKh-41 BACTERIOFAG (Bakteriophag) from SM,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;text-autospace:none">BTKh-5 LAKTOLEN (plus documentary photography),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;text-autospace:none">BTKh-8 BIOTREK Container (plus documentary photography).</li></ul> 
With the G1 camcorder configured to provide live “over-the-shoulder” viewing in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Satoshi Furukawa finished setting up the FPEF MS (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility / Marangoni Surface) payload for upcoming Marangoni experimentation.       [Steps today included re-installing the experiment cover body into the FPEF, connecting the payload bus cable and the 1553B IPU (Image Processing Unit) user  video cable between IPU and FPEF, installing the FPEF silicone hose and closing out the Marangoni MWA I/Fs (Maintenance Work Area Interfaces B &amp; A.     Background:  In microgravity, fluids react differently to stresses when compared to the same stresses on Earth.  Understanding the responses to the stressors allows for improved fluid flow models to be designed.  Mass transfer on or in a liquid due to surface tension differences is called the Marangoni Effect (which, for example, stabilizes a soap film).  The Marangoni convection experiments in the FPEF examine fluid tension flow in micro-G:  first, a liquid bridge of silicone oil is formed into a pair of disks.  Then, using temperature differences imposed on the disks, convection is induced causing the silicone oil to move and transition through different types of flows because of its fluid instability: successively from laminar to oscillatory, chaos, and turbulence flows as the driving force increases.  The flow and temperature fields are observed in each stage and the transition conditions and processes are investigated.]
 
In preparation for their return to gravity on tomorrow night, Andrey &amp; Sasha undertook Part 2 of their 5<sup>th</sup> and final exercise/training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the VELO bike ergometer, taking turns in assisting each other as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Medical telemetry monitoring on the ground was at 6:16am EDT for Andrey, 7:52am for Sasha.  The activity was then closed out.       [The assessments, lasting one hour each, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground sites, uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -35, -40, and -45 mmHg for five min. each, then -25, -35, and -45 mmHg (Torr) for 10 min. each plus -30mmHg for 5 min. while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
FE-3 Garan opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images could be captured today by ground commanding.       [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
Activities on Sergei Volker’s work schedule included –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">Inspecting the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and verifying proper watering of the KM A32 &amp; A24 root modules; in addition, taking the periodic documentary photography of setup &amp; activities;   [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">Collecting air samples for return on 26S, using a Russian AK-1M absorber in the SM &amp; FGB for air &amp; Freon as well as IPD-CO Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (Carbon Monoxide) and subsequently also for NH<sub>3</sub> (Ammonia),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">Conducting the regular transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWCs (Contingency Water Containers) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  When filled, the EDV was to be connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit;   [the 40-minute “separation” procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">Handling the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM;  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">Completing the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).</li></ul> 
Mike Fossum’s maintenance activities involved –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo5">The newly introduced periodic CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer w/Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization) isolator inspection;  [during Satoshi’s CEVIS inspection on 9/2, isolator “D” was found to be very close to the failure criterion of 9 severed wires.  Since there are no spares on board until Progress 45P arrival, the current plan involves weekly inspections, swapping isolator locations and potentially using worn spares as required.  Mike reported that he could not see any difference in any wirestops, including close comparison between those on A &amp; D], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo5">Performed the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 21 min (during which WHC was not available).</li></ul> 
Later today, Mike will also configure the Node-2 Port CQ (Crew Quarters) for the next on-call crewmember by connecting the Node-2 Port ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) #15 to the CQ ATU, then verify correct speaker connectivity. 
 
Working in the Kibo laboratory, Satoshi checked out the IMV (Intermodular Ventilation) starboard forward fan for a noise heard on 9/8, using the handheld microphone of the Kibo ATU close to the running fan’s grill.       [After the noise report, the fan had been shut down by the ground to mitigate the risk of hardware damage.  The sound recorded by Satoshi during the SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center)-commanded fan startup will be used for further troubleshooting.] 
 
Sasha took care of the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness).
 
Later, FE-1 was to initiate, on go-ahead from TsUP-Moscow, another refresh of the ISS interior with an O<sub>2 </sub>repress from Progress M-10M/42P (#410) tankage, with the Russian Elektron oxygen generator currently off.
 
Ron, Andrey &amp; Sasha again had about an hour each set aside for personal crew departure preparations; these are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
With ISS Command now being transferred from Andrey Borisenko to Mike Fossum for Increment 29, with Sergei Volkov and Satoshi Furukawa as Flight Engineers, Andrey &amp; Sergei at ~4:15am signed two copies of the formal Russian handover protocol document certifying RS handover/acceptance, including the contents of Progress 42P (#410), currently docked at DC Nadir, MRM1 Rassvet, and MRM2 Poisk.      [The first copy remains on ISS, the second copy will be returned to the ground on Soyuz TMA-21.  “We, the Undersigned, have executed this Protocol to the effect that Andrey Ivanovich Borisenko, a crew member in charge of the ISS-27 RS, handed over the ISS RS, and Sergei Alexandrovich Volkov, a crew member in charge of the ISS-28 RS, accepted the ISS RS, including special operating features, onboard system or equipment anomalies, equipment stowed for disposal at SM PrK location (per IMS data), Progress 410 items (per IMS data), MRM1, MRM2 equipment (per IMS data).”] 
 
Later, Borisenko &amp; Fossum joined in a CDR-to-CDR Handover activity, in which Andrey reviewed with Mike, the new CDR, some lessons learned, best practices and other handover items as needed, just as Dima Kondratyev &amp; Scott Kelly had done during the last turnover.
 
The traditional “Change of Command” ceremony follows later today: it is scheduled at ~5:40pm-6:00pm EDT with all crewmembers, officially marking the transfer of the baton from Increment 28 to Increment 29.
 
FE-3, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Ron at ~4:35am, Mike at ~9:05am, Satoshi at ~11:55am EDT.
 
At ~4:15am, FE-5 Furukawa conducted the regular tagup with the Japanese Flight Control Team at SSIPC/Tsukuba via S-band/audio.      [This conference is scheduled once every week, between the ISS crewmembers and SSIPC.]
 
At ~4:30am, Mike Fossum powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 4:35am conducted a ham radio session with students at Universita degli Studi di Foggia, Foggia, Italy.     [Downlink from FE-6:  “Great contact!  Thanks again for the reminder - no room to be late on these!! –mike.”]
 
At ~7:10am, Satoshi ( a medical doctor) conducted a JAXA PAO TV event with the JAXA Elderly Health Care organization at Tsukuba, responding to questions from about 70 people involved in elderly health care and JAXA Astronaut Chiaki Mukai.        [Yasuharu Takahashi (74):  Do bone fractures happen in space? Are there any differences in healing of the bone fractures or any other conditions about bones such as the process of aging?  Emiko Sasaki (67): Since ISS is limited in space and you are in zero-gravity, I think you feel the stress.  How do you manage your stress?  Kenichi Ichihara (60): As a strategy to take action to our aging society, keeping good health of the elderly population is a very important issue.  How do you think the experiments or the action you’ve been taking could be used for the elderly population to enjoy their lives?  Mr. Satoshi Tatsumiya (42): We’ve heard that there are similarities to aging of bones and muscles that happen in space.  What do you think is important to keep yourself from aging physically?  Anything about your meals, supplements, training or mental things?  Masayoshi Honda (61): Without the effect of gravity, is it difficult to swallow down the food in space?  Do you feel any changes when you went up to space for the first time, and now?  (Such as choking, differences in swallowing down the food, or using different muscles compared to what you do on the earth.  Do you have any tips to do it easily?)  Masae Kuramochi (64): It’s difficult to walk when you feel the pain in your knees and back.  It would be difficult to develop your bones with walking.  Do you have any advice to develop your bones without walking?  Hideaki Ishibashi (49): Since lower legs get weaker slowly because of aging and loss of exercise, it’s hard to feel the motor deterioration ourselves.  Do you feel any differences with the loss of bone mass and muscles?  Takuma Kamiya (23): Is it easy to get deep thrombophlebitis in space compared to being on earth?  Do you train yourself for soleus venous thrombus?  How does the milking action of veins change in zero-gravity?  Any actions to prevent that?  Hideo Matsuzawa (72): I’ve watched an astronaut eating Japanese food.  I’ve heard that the strength of muscles can get so much lower.  Do you feel any changes in the power of chewing or texture of the food?  Masako Toda (46):  If you were disabled and bedridden in the future, which would you choose: to live in space or here on the earth?  Chiaki Mukai (59): How do you feel the balance of your body in Kibo?   Does it feel like floating on the water or being in the water?  Without gravity, don’t you feel the gravity point as you would on earth?]
 
Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron turns on the MPC and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Mike will turn MPC off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-3, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-1, FE-4).  For Borisenko, Garan &amp; Samokutyayev, this was the last day of exercise on ISS.  The crewmembers stowed their exercise equipment as per stowage instructions.
 
A task listed for Andrey, Sergei &amp; Sasha on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today continues to be the preparation &amp; downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Podgorica, Montenegro (looking slightly right of track, just after crossing the Adriatic Sea, for this capital city of 151,000 people.  Podgorica lies inland, immediately north of Lake Scutari.  Podgorica is the largest city in Montenegro, a small state that reestablished its independence in 2006), Lisbon, Portugal (ISS had a nadir pass over this capital city with fair weather expected.  Lisbon lies at the mouth of the Tagus River estuary, and has a population of around 545,000), Coast Mts., BC, Canada (ISS passed over the southern Coast Mountains.  Looking for glaciers and ice fields on the summits of the mountains and in the adjacent valleys.  Glaciers in the Coast Mountains have been receding for the past several decades), and Virginia Coast Reserve, Virginia (this environmental site is the barrier island-lagoon-mainland landscape of the Eastern Shore of Virginia.  Looking left of track on the seaward side of the Delmarva Peninsula, close to the southern tip).
