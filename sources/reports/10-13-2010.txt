ISS On-Orbit Status 10/13/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
 At wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 After wakeup, CDR Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 CDR Wheelock, FE-3 Kelly &amp; FE-6 Walker continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 6<sup>th</sup> for Wheels &amp; Shannon, 1<sup>st</sup> for Scott, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Also at day’s begin, FE-2 Skripochka terminated his first experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 Afterwards, Skripochka had 2h 50m reserved for doing his first onboard session of the Russian biomedical MBI-15 "Pilot-M"/NEURO signal response experiment after setting up the workplace and equipment, assisted by Yurchikhin who also took documentary photos.   Later, the Pilot-M &amp; Neurolab-2000M gear was disassembled &amp; stowed away, data files were downloaded, and Oleg reported to TsUP on his run.     [MBI-15 requires the Multipurpose Hardware Bench as a table, ankle restraint system, eyeball electrodes for an EOG (electrooculogram), and two hand controllers (RUO &amp; RUD) for testing piloting skill in “flying” simulations on a laptop (RSK1) with software (v. 2.0) under stopwatch control, as well as for studying special features of the psychophysiologic response of cosmonauts to the effects of stress factors in flight.]
 
 Alex “Sasha” Kaleri concluded his first session of the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2 protocol, started yesterday.     [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Alex doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]
 
 Oleg “Alik” Skripochka began his own first session with the 24-hr MedOps PZE MO-2 Kardiomed protocol.
 
 In preparation for the STS-133/ULF5 spacewalks, CDR Wheelock gathered special EVA tools, i.e., SARJ (Solar Alpha Rotary Joint) launch restraints and rail stubs, to be provided to FE-3 Scott Kelly for his preparatory work.
 
 Kelly then worked on the launch restraints and rail stubs for the ULF5 EVAs, including cutting the lanyards.  Later, he unpacked and assembled the EVA CLPA (Camera Light Pan Tilt Assembly), then gathered other tools for use during the spacewalks.
 
 Wheelock continued his series of Sabatier reactor installation tasks, first temporarily removing the T2/COLBERT handrail to make room, then replacing the current OGS AAA (Oxygen Generator System Avionics Air Assembly) manifold with a new manifold designed to be compatible with Sabatier.
 
 Next, Wheels tipped the OGS rack down, mated all electrical/data and fluid lines from the rack to the Sabatier, then rotated it up again and connected the CO<sub>2</sub> inlet QD (quick disconnect) at the rack UIP (Utility Interface Panel).     [This completed the Sabatier installation.  It now remains for Scott Kelly to perform the ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) flow adjusting/balancing with the Non-Intrusive Flow Meter equipment, after which the reactor should be producing water.]
 
 Working on the BLB/WAICO (BioLab/(Waving &amp; Coiling of Arabidopsis at Different Gravity Levels) payload in the ESA COL, the CDR later supported a functional maintenance test on the HM (Handling Mechanism) by first removing the standard AAS (Automatic Ambient Stowage) insert and later re-installing it.
 
 FE-1 Kaleri, assisted by Yurchikhin as a handover activity, continued the extended leak integrity checking of the spare BZh Liquid Unit (#056) for the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator, repressed on 9/16 with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to 1 atm (1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), by conducting the usual pressure check and recharging it with N<sub>2</sub> from BPA-1M Nitrogen Purge Unit as required to verify the unit’s hermeticity.     [Objective of the monthly checkout of the spare BZh, which has been in stowage since March 2007, is to check for leakage and good water passage through the feed line inside of the BZh (from ZL1 connector to the buffer tank) and to check the response of the Electronics Unit’s micro switches (signaling “Buffer Tank is Empty” &amp; “Buffer Tank is Full”.  During Elektron operation, the inert gas locked up in the BZh has the purpose to prevent dangerous O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> mixing.  A leaking BZh cannot be used.]
 
 For his familiarization &amp; training with the T2/COLBERT treadmill, FE-3 Kelly installed the T2 handrail and removed the protective alignment guides, then observed Doug Wheelock during his exercise run on the T2.    [New crewmembers receive one training session on each CMS (Counter Measures System) apparatus by an experienced colleague.]
 
 Likewise, Alex &amp; Oleg reviewed exercise procedures on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) and observed Shannon Walker during her workout on the machine.
 
 Joined by Oleg as part of handover activities, Fyodor performed the periodic inspection of the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor’s sediment trap insert (VU) in the SM (Service Module).    [The Russian SRVK-2M converts collected condensate into drinking water and dispenses the reclaimed potable water.]
 
 Afterwards, FE-2 continued the current round of monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today in the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok), inspecting &amp; cleaning interior closeout panel vent screens (panels 201, 301, 401). 
 
 Walker &amp; Yurchikhin took the standard 30-min Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) onboard familiarization training, the second for both of them, using D2Xs digital still cameras with 400mm &amp; 800mm lenses with manual focusing and taking practice shots of CEO (Crew Earth Observation) ground features from SM (Service Module) windows #6 or #8 facing in flight direction, with images having 40-50% overlap and about 20 images in each sequence.  Afterwards, Walker transferred the shots to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for subsequent downlink for ground analysis.     [The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the next Shuttle (STS-133/Discovery/ULF5), to be launched 11/1.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Endeavour, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
 Other activities completed by Shannon Walker included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Starting another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later   [this was the 31<sup>st</sup> session with the GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 100 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],</li><li>Powering up the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), and then running a continuity check on the SAMS TSH (Space Acceleration Measurement System Triaxial Sensor Head) cable at the MSG,</li><li>Uninstalling the SODI CLLD (Selectable Optical Diagnostics Instrument Colloid) &amp; SODI Core hardware for stowage after termination of ground-commanded SODI CLLD operations, </li><li>Performing the periodic changeout of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) urine receptacle (UR) and insert filter (IF) with new units  [WHC was unavailable for use during this activity], and</li><li>Completing the periodic status check &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) payload in the Lab.</li></ul> 
 All crewmembers took the monthly O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.     [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There has been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.]
 
 Alex Kaleri conducted his first data collection for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.     [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
 Doug Wheelock worked on the ARED exerciser, performing the periodic evacuation of its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration,
 
 Yurchikhin performed the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization).     [This is primarily an in section of the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.]
 
 Later, FE-5 completed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, DC1–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 Fyodor also did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance by updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Alex conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Yurchikhin conducted a 3-hr IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the TORU manual teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system in the SM, removing its BPS Signal Conversion Unit and replacing it with a spare unit.
 
 Before sleeptime, Fyodor also set up and readied the PZE MO-9 equipment for another Russian “Urolux” biochemical urine testing, scheduled tomorrow for all three Russian crewmembers.    [MO-9 is conducted regularly every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for US crewmembers for IMG (Integrated Medical Group) PHS evaluation as part of the "PFE w/o Blood Labs" exam.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally for the Mir program.  The data are then entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software.]
 
 Scott unpacked the new HMS IMAKs (Health Maintenance System ISS Medical Accessory Kits) from Soyuz 24S and stowed them in the station, the kits in Ovhd CQs (Crew Quarters), the Tonometer and eye chart in the Lab loc. D2.
 
 FE-1 had ~2h reserved to conduct an IMS-based inventory/audit of newly unloaded arrived &amp; transferred cargo items from Progress &amp; Soyuz.
 
 Alex, Oleg &amp; Scott again had an hour each set aside for crew onboard orientation plus time for adaptation as required.    [During the first two weeks after their arrival, a new ISS crew will have 1 hour a day (or more if needed) to adjust to living in space.]
 
 CDR, FE-3 &amp; FE-6 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Scott at ~8:45am, Shannon at ~10:25am, Wheels at ~11:55am EDT.
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-3, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 At ~11:30am, Wheelock supported a PAO TV event, being interviewed by SPC Chuck Gill for Soldiers Magazine and Soldiers Radio &amp; TV.
 
 ATV PCE Checkout:    The ATV PCE (Automated Transfer Vehicle Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) is being checked out by ESA/TsUP today, today and tomorrow, to verify proper operation of the PCE WAL3 (Low Gain) and WAS2 (Medium Gain) antennas as well as the PCE equipment internal to the SM.  The WAL3 &amp; WAS2 antennas are prime for ATV Rendezvous operations.  As part of the checkout, the PCE equipment is activated, directed to perform a self-test and switched to CW (Carrier Wave) mode.  After an attitude maneuver that maximizes coverage for the antenna(s) being tested, the PCE transmits a beacon to ESA’s Maspalomas (MAS) and Villafranca (VIL) Ground Stations.  The ground stations track the ISS, check that the CW signal is received, verify the proper RF power level, and record the evolution of the RF power level over time.  For the duration of the maneuvers, Lab, JPM and Node-3 Cupola windows are shuttered and the SARJ (Solar Alpha Rotary Joint) is feathered (arrays facing RS thrusters edge-on).  Today’s test began at ~1:47am EDT with attitude control handover to Russian MCS (Motion Control System), followed by maneuver to WAL3 antenna test attitude at 1:52am, maneuver to LVLH TEA (Local Vertical Local Horizontal Torque Equilibrium) and return of attitude control to US CMGs at ~5:30am. 
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Lusaka, Zambia (this capital city is home to more than 3 million people.  Looking nadir.  Like most cities, it can be difficult to discern: center-pivot circles and angular fields are the crew’s up-track visual cue), Serra da Cangalha Impact Crater, Brazil (ISS had a nadir pass over this elusive target in the dissected highlands of northeastern Brazil.  This 12 km in diameter crater located in Brazil is a subtle feature on the landscape.  It is mainly defined by a circular drainage pattern surrounding the remnants of a central peak.  This crater was last photographed by the astronauts on the Apollo Soyuz Test Project [ASTP].  An overlapping mapping strip is requested in order to acquire views of the crater), and Hurricane Paula, Caribbean Sea (Dynamic Event:  Hurricane Paula should have been visible to the left of track, just off the coasts of Mexico and Cozumel.  At the time of this overpass winds were predicted to be approximately 75 knots.  Contextual mapping views of the hurricane were requested).
