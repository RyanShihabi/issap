Post Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Activities: Following yesterday’s successful US EVA #51 Node 2 (N2) Forward External Wireless Communications (EWC), the crew began stowing the tools and cameras used during the EVA and conducted an Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) water recharge.  The crew also participated in an EVA debrief with ground specialists.
Gravitational References for Sensitomotor Performance (GRASP): The crew configured the GRASP equipment for operations and performed three science operational runs in the seated position. GRASP is intended to provide insight into how the central nervous system integrates information from different sensory modalities, encoded in different reference frames, in order to coordinate movements of the hand with objects in the environment.  Performed on the ISS, in conjunction with a series of experiments performed on the ground, GRASP explores the interaction between all of the various sensory cues.
TangoLab-1: The crew moved the TangoLab-1 facility from EXPRESS Rack 4 in the JEM to EXPRESS Rack 7 in the US Lab and activated the payload to allow the ground to check telemetry. TangoLab-1 is a reconfigurable general research facility designed for microgravity research and development and pilot manufacturing on the ISS.
Nanoracks-Remove Debris Satellite (RemDeb): The crew inspected the satellite bolt holes for the RemDeb payload in support of the launch of the RemDeb planned for June 20th.  NanoRacks-Remove Debris demonstrates an approach to reducing the risks presented by space debris or “space junk”. Collisions in space may have serious consequences but research has shown that removing the largest debris significantly reduces the chance of collisions. NanoRacks-Remove Debris demonstrates using a 3D camera to map location and speed of debris and deploying a net to capture and de-orbit simulated debris up to 1m in size. Ground experts will analyze video of the demonstration runs.
