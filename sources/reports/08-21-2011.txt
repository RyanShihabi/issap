ISS On-Orbit Status 08/21/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Sunday �C Crew off-duty day.   Ahead: Week 23 of Increment 28.
 
As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel.
 
CDR Borisenko did the daily routine inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, checking for proper fan operation by testing the air flow from the ventilators BO A04 &amp; BO A05 and verifying that both LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are lit, then watering the root modules KM A32 &amp; A24 to the roper humidity level.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] 
 
FE-3 Garan opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Garan will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
FE-4 Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.      [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
FE-5 Furukawa concluded his 2<sup>nd</sup> (FD30) 24-hr ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~12:55pm EDT).   Data download from all devices to the HRF (Human Research Function) PC1 laptop will be scheduled later.     [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.]
 
After the crew’s midday break (9:00am-10:00am), FE-6 Fossum turned on the ERB-2 (Erasmus Recording Binocular) in the COL EDR (Columbus Orbital Laboratory European Drawer Rack) for downlinking stereoscopic ERB-2 footage via the HRDL (High Rate Data Link).     [Data rate: 18 Mbps.]
 
Assisting MCC-Houston in the full calibration commanding of the MCA (Major Constituent Analyzer) in Node-3, Ron opened the MCA’s HV02 (Hand Valve 02) valve manually and closed it 10 min later.      [MCC-H has no insight into HV 02 valve position and requires crew calls to open and close.  Note: the Lab MCA is non-operational due to a failure of its ORU assembly.] 
 
Sasha Samokutyayev performed maintenance on the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system in the SM, reconnecting power &amp; data cables to two (ZU2A &amp; ZU2B) of its four ZU memory/recording devices, behind panels 313 &amp; 314.   BITS2-12 and VD-SU control mode were unpowered during the operation.    [BITS2-12 is the primary telemetry downlink path for both FGB and SM parameters.  The system collects, records, and transmits measurement data concerning all RS (Russian Segment) systems, science hardware and health status parameters of crewmembers to the ground.  It provides ground specialists with insight in RS systems operations.]
 
CDR, FE-3 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Andrey at ~7:35am, Ron at ~11:25am, Mike at ~12:20pm EDT.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
