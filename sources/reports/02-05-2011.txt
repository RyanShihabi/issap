ISS On-Orbit Status 02/05/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew rest day.  
 
FE-4 Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Before sleeptime, Dmitri will inspect the filters again, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
Kelly, Kaleri, Skripochka, Kondratyev, Nespoli &amp; Coleman completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of the uborka house cleaning, Sasha, Oleg &amp; Dima conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille and Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM (Service Module).
 
CDR Kelly supported the ground in deploying the uplinked Video Streaming Service Pack software on T61p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops.       [Onboard support consisted of activating the SSC-19 wireless network connection and installing USB video adapters into the T61c clients, followed after completed deployment by removing &amp; stowing of the adapters, then reconfiguring SSC-19 to wired network connections for the Robotics video.]
 
Oleg Skripochka conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
At ~6:15am EST, Dmitri Kondratyev supported a Russian PAO TV event, answering questions from children of the orphanage and students of the city of Petrozavodsk.      [This launched the “Shop Talk” project, part of the “Coming from Childhood” information web site for the parents and children in Karelia, with the objective of introducing the youth to existing professions and to the best representatives of these professions.  Nikolay Ivanovich Levin, Petrozavodsk city executive, and some of Dmitri’s comrades-in-arms from the Besovets military post will take part in this session.]
 
At ~9:30am, Alex, Oleg &amp; Dmitri joined in a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking a message of greetings to the 43<sup>rd</sup> Special Naval Aviation Assault Regiment on the occasion of the Defender of the Fatherland Day, followed by a TV address to the participants of a gala meeting in commemoration of the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Academician Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh.    [Keldysh, three times Hero of Socialist Labor, was an outstanding scientist, mathematician, and mechanic, the chief ideologist of cosmonautics theory, one of the creators and managers of national space program and President of the Academy of Science, and the first director of the Applied Math Institute.]
 
CDR &amp; FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Paolo at ~9:55a, Scott at ~2:15pm.
 
The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).
