USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #23 Preparations: In preparation for USOS EVA #23, planned for next Tuesday, July 16, all three USOS crew members participated in a Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) software review. They also reviewed the timeline, briefing package and cribsheet, followed by a conference with ground teams. Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Parmitano replaced Long Life Batteries (LLB) and Metal Oxide (METOX) in his and FE-3 Cassidy’s suits.
Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Urine Receptacle Remove and Replace (R&R): Cassidy completed this routine maintenance consisting of WHC urine receptacle and insert filter R&R followed by a functionality test.
Countermeasures System (CMS) Periodic Fitness Evaluation (PFE): Nyberg performed her monthly PFE with assistance from Parmitano as Crew Medical Officer (CMO). The evaluation is to monitor crewmembers’ overall fitness levels to ensure that cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health and performance is satisfactory. This is a graded exercise test on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation and Stabilization (CEVIS).
False Fire Alarms in Mini Research Module (MRM)-2 and Functional Cargo Block (FGB): This morning, a fire alarm initiated in MRM2. The crew confirmed there was no fire and ground controllers reconfigured systems back to their nominal configurations. After the fire alarm annunciated, the crew was initially unable to hear Space to Ground audio in the Russian Segment. Engineering teams are gathering data on the audio configuration to determine the cause. Later in the day, another fire alarm annunciated in the FGB. The crew again confirmed that there was no fire.  Audio communication with the crew was nominal following the second false fire alarm.
