ISS On-Orbit Status 06/26/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – crew off-duty day.    &gt;&gt;&gt;Solar Beta angle reached its high point last night and is coming down now.  With ISS in constant sunlight, there are great naked-eye visibility opportunities at local nighttime (for viewing times check <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html">http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html</a>)!&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
  CDR Skvortsov completed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  FE-5 Yurchikhin terminated his first experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-MED laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
  At wake-up, Doug Wheelock continued his first session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken during the day.]
 
  Later in  the day, Wheels set up the equipment for his first 24-hour urine collections of the Nutrition/Repository/Pro K generic protocol, beginning tomorrow.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood &amp; urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
  The six station residents performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the uborka house cleaning, the Russian crewmembers conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson once again serviced the CSLM-2 (Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures 2) experiment in the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), now for the new SPU (Sample Processing Unit) #10, installed yesterday.    [Task steps included inspecting, activating &amp; checking the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) for acceptable humidity &amp; temperature levels in the sample chamber, followed by opening the water valve, then closing it and opening the vent valve to initiate the 3<sup>rd</sup> of 4 vacuum draws on the sample chamber.  Vacuum vent #4 is to be started later in the day and let run overnight, after again letting the water line vent into the work volume for a while.]
 
  After setting up the Lab RWS (Robotic Workstation) for the video operation during the Soyuz 23S relocation on Monday, FE-6 Walker, CDR Skvortsov &amp; FE-5 Yurchikhin configured and tested the RS (Russian Segment) video “scheme” which utilizes TV conversion on a laptop to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band of the RS video signal from the SONY HDV camera via MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder from FGB &amp; SM, in order to downlink “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.  The test was conducted from 8:15am-10:00am EDT.    [The associated conversion laptop, an A31p (SSC-1) in the FGB, on which Alexander will monitor the video stream during the relocation, was later shut down by the FE-6.]
 
  At ~9:00am, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  Mikhail Kornienko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Shannon also filled out her first weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).  (Deferred from 6/24).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-4, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-3).    [For his TVIS workout, Yurchikhin used the TVIS SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices) tailored for him.  The protective SPDs are required for new crewmembers for the first seven TVIS sessions for safety.  This was Fyodor’s 6<sup>th</sup> session.]
 
  CDR, FE-2 &amp; FE-6 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Alexander at ~4:45am, Tracy at ~5:20am &amp; later at ~4:45pm, Shannon at ~3:30pm EDT.
 
 Ku Band Outage:  In the current high Beta angle environment (left side of orbit track always in darkness), the backside of the Ku antenna gets too cold if not kept turned sunward until temperatures return to normal.  While so “parked”, Ku band is lost.
