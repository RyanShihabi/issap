ISS On-Orbit Status 01/11/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway: Week 7 of Increment 22.  (100<sup>th</sup> day in space for Jeff Williams &amp; Maxim Suraev).
 
 At wakeup, Exp-22 Flight Engineer Suraev terminated his seventh experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/SONOKARD, by taking the recording device from his SONOKARD sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-MED laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [SONOKARD objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 FE-4 Kotov began the day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by FE-1 Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Kotov, Suraev, Williams, Creamer &amp; Noguchi started out with the periodic before-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IM mass measurement device.  Suraev set up the IM and later stowed it away again.  Additionally, Maxim &amp; Oleg also did PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.     [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IM "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ].
 
 A major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) task for Jeff Williams today was to undertake a reverse-flush procedure on the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) in the U.S. Lab.     [After setting up for the pumping job, the task consisted of forcing water through a suspected blockage in the line and into a sample bag for visual observation, then also forcing water through plumbing and into the Waste Water ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) to complete cleaning.  After the WPA Pump/Sep ORU reinstallation, the ground will conduct a multi-hour leak check of the WRS (Water Recovery System)/WPA.  Background:  For the past several weeks, the WPA has experienced an anomalous pressure between the Waste Water ORU and the MLS (Mostly Liquid Separator) located in the Pump/Separator ORU.  It is believed that this pressure anomaly indicates a blockage in this line.  While the root cause is not understood, today’s troubleshooting is intended to push any blockage back upstream into the Waste Water ORU.  The Pump/Separator ORU is comprised of the Pump ORU and the Separator Filter ORU.  The line containing the clog is in the MLS which is contained in the Separator Filter ORU.]
 
 FE-6 Creamer performed the regular 30-day inspection of the AED (Automated External Defibrillator) in the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) Rack.     [The AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient.  It then can treat them through defibrillation, i.e., the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.  AEDs are generally either held by trained personnel who will attend events or are public access units which can be found in places including corporate and government offices, shopping centers, airports, restaurants, casinos, hotels, sports stadiums, schools and universities, community centers, fitness centers, health clubs and any other location where people may congregate.]
 
 The FE-6 then hooked up the UOP DCP (Utility Outlet Panel/Display &amp; Control Panel) power bypass cable at the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation), used for video coverage of the subsequent Robotics operations with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) camera system.    [Lab RWS DCP cable should have been connected already.]
 
 TJ also configured the JEM RMS (Robotic Manipulator System) Elbow PTU (Pan &amp; Tilt Unit) in viewing support position.
 
 Afterwards, Soichi Noguchi &amp; TJ Creamer worked with the SSRMS on the first part of the relocation of the ESP-3 (External Storage Platform 3) from the P3U (Port 3 Upper) Truss to the S3L (Starboard 3 Lower) Truss.      [Today’s task consisted of UCCAS-1 (Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attachment System #1) operations on the P3 segment of the main truss to release the ESP-3 and of relocating it to the MCAS (Mobile Base System [MBS] Capture Attach System), i.e., involving demate of the UMA (Umbilical Mechanism Assembly) and deployment (opening) of the CLA (Capture Latch Assembly) utilizing CAS (Carrier Attach System) normal state.  The MT (Mobile Transporter) with the ESP-3 will then be translated by the ground from WS-7 (Worksite 7) to WS-2 at ~2:30pm-3:30pm.]
 
 TJ initiated (later terminated) the 5-hr sampling run (the 60<sup>th</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer).  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.    [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 FE-1 Suraev performed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated tonight at ~4:15pm EST before the docking, followed tomorrow by Bed #2 regeneration.  (Last time done: 12/22-12/23/09).     [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.]
 
 Working on the ESA FSL (Fluid Science Laboratory), Noguchi removed four bolts locking the FCE (Facility Core Element) to the FSL main structure during reboost, in preparation of upcoming Canadian MVIS (Microgravity Vibration Insulation System) activities.
 
 Later, Soichi removed the FPEF MI (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility / Marangoni Inside) from the JAXA FPEF and set it up on the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) for planned repair activities.
 
 The FE-5 also undertook his first session with the JAXA experiment BIORHYTHMS (Biological Rhythms), for which he donned the electrodes of the DWH (Digital Walk Holter) for ECG (Electrocardiogram) recording, then started the data take for the next 24 hrs.
 
 Working in the DC-1 (Docking Compartment) to continue final preparations for the Russian EVA-24 on 1/14 and the suited dry-run tomorrow, Oleg Kotov &amp; Max Suraev –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Reviewed EVA procedures from DC-1 (with Creamer participating),</li><li>Configured the STTS communications systems in the DC1 for their presence, </li><li>Installing the usual additional BNP portable air repress bottle in the DC1 (to support a DC1 repress in the event of a failure of the DC1/PkhO hatch’s pressure equalization valve)  [the regular BNP bottle is already installed in the repress line of the SM’s work compartment (RO).] </li><li>Installing US EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) components on the Orlan-MK suits, such as helmet lights,</li><li>Installing Orlan attached hardware (OTA) plus taking photos of the outfitted Orlans for downlink (OTA equipment includes: right-hand swing arm with tool caddy, small trash bag, wire ties, tethers, D2Xs camera, ratchet wrench and wing knob),</li><li>Preparing auxiliary NASA equipment to be used in Orlan plus taking photos of the outfitted Orlans for downlink,</li><li>Mounting the Fresnel lens viewing aid in the helmets,</li><li>Filling the DIDBs (disposable in-suit drink bags) and installed them in the suits, and</li><li>Unstowing EVA emergency first-aid medical packs and stowing them in the DC1.</li> </ul> 
 (NASA confirmed today that full-scale testing of suits has been complete and that all suits are clear of issues and ready for EVA).  
 
 Later, the FE-1 worked in the SM (Service Module) on the KURS-P system, connecting LF &amp; RF cables to switch it over to support docking operations at the zenith port of the SM.
 
 Suraev also conducted his seventh data collection for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.     [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
 Oleg performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.
 
 Soichi took care of the periodic evacuation of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.    [The pneumatic cylinder of the ARED continues to exhibit a small leak, and an onboard repair cannot be conducted at this time.  The crew continues exercising with the current configuration, with frequent cylinder evacuations.]
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1.
 
 Afterwards, TJ transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
 At ~1:44am EST Jeff powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 1:49am conducted a ham radio session with students at Humanity Primary and Junior High School, Tou-cheng, Taiwan, R.O.C.
