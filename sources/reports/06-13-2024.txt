USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #90: Today’s Radio Frequency Group (RFG) Retrieval 2.5 EVA was scrubbed. The Expedition 71 EVA series will now consist of two EVAs. The RFG Retrieval 2.5 EVA is now planned for June 24th and a second EVA is being targeted for July 2nd. Details for the July 2nd EVA are still being discussed.
Boeing CST-100 Crewed Flight Test (CFT): Today, the CFT crew was mostly off duty, but did complete some Genes in Space Molecular Operations and Sequencing (GiSMOS) operations and a partial CST Stowage Audit.
Payloads:
GiSMOS: MiniPCR sequencer was stopped and stowed and the Flow Cell sample Serial Number (S/N)-101 was placed into cold stowage. More information on this experiment can be found here.
Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4): The crew verified that the Video Monitor was switched off and that the gas valves were all closed. The flex hoses were not disconnected per ground request. PK-4 looks at complex or “dusty” plasmas, in which small particles are suspended and form patterns in ionized gas. More information on PK-4 can be found here.
Systems:
USOS Hatch Seal Inspection: The crew inspected the hatch seals, hatch plate sealing surfaces, crank handle mechanisms, and hatch seal interlocking joints for damage or foreign object debris (FOD) on the Node 1 Forward, Starboard, and Port hatches. The crew reported, imaged, and cleaned various items of note on the hatches.
Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Manual Fill Initiation and Termination: Today, the crew initiated a manual fill of the WHC EДВ-СВ (Water Container) using a Post-Flight Analysis Bag to capture any pressure relief to protect the dose pump. The fill was then terminated, and the Post-Flight Analysis Bag was analyzed after the pressure relief burp. The ЕДВ-CB is intended for short-term storage and manual water transportation between facilities. After successfully filling the EДВ-СВ, the crew returned the WHC to nominal use.
