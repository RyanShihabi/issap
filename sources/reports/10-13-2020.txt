Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) 3004/3006 Loop Scrub, and Iodination: The crew performed EMU water loop scrubs and then acquired and tested water samples for conductivity on units 3004 and 3006. Additionally, the crew installed the Hard Upper Torso (HUT) ORU Scrubber to a spare HUT to scrub and iodinate the spare HUT water lines. EMU Loop Scrubs are required preventive maintenance needed to remove any chemical and biological contaminants from the EMU transport loop.
