ISS On-Orbit Status 04/01/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
 At wake-up, CDR Oleg Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime this morning, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-5 Noguchi completed another Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  Originally planned for a total of 121 RST runs, Jeff completed 108 runs by the time of his return last week.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 CDR Kotov supported TsUP-Moscow in reactivating the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator by monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.     [Measurements were taken twice, 3-4 minutes apart, with the temperature probe of the Elektronika MultiMeter.  If BD temperature exceeded 50 degC, Elektron had to be turned off.  The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup. Elektron had been turned off while the cabin atmosphere was being refreshed with pressurized O<sub>2</sub> from Progress 35P storage.]
 
 In preparation for arrival operations of Soyuz 22S on Sunday morning, Kotov performed a power cycling test on the US-22 matching unit of the KURS-P approach &amp; docking system.
 
 Working in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-5 Noguchi installed the ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) Sampling Adapter and collected a coolant sample for return to the ground.
 
 Noguchi then conducted chemical testing of the 20 mL water sample collected by him yesterday from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser), using EHS C-SPE (Environmental Health System / Colorimetric Solid-Phase Extraction) analysis and the CWQMK (Colorimetric Water Quality Monitoring Kit).     [Results of the Iodine standard &amp; analysis (1.044ppm/0.380ppm) and of the Silver standard &amp; analysis (0.268ppm/0.100ppm) were downloaded.]
 
 With the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) continuing to run nominally, producing water from urine, Soichi performed another fill of the UPA WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly), from a Russian EDV-U (urine collector-water container), using the EDV transfer hose, instead of PTU (Pretreat Urine) T-valve, and an electric compressor.
 
 Working on the OGS (Oxygen Generation System) in the Node-3 AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) Rack, FE-6 Creamer mated QD (Quick Disconnect) connectors and tied in the H<sub>2</sub> (hydrogen) sensor ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit). 
 
 Afterwards, Timothy conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week.    [The updated card (23-0003B) lists 96 CWCs (2,362.5 L total) for the five types of water now identified on board: 1. technical water (20 CWCs with 781.3 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 432.1 L in 12 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 171.6 L in 4 bags still requiring sample analysis,  2. potable water (9 CWCs with 366.7 L, of which 1 bag with 23.0 L contains Wautersia, 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 4 bags with 170.8 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use,  3. iodinated water (58 CWCs with 1089.1 L),  4. condensate water (7 bags with 101.1 L, including 2 empty ones and 2 CWCs with 43.4 L that are to be used with microbial filter, and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (2 CWCs with 24.3 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 In addition, the FE-6 completed the periodic (monthly) battery check and reboot of all active US PCS (Portable Computer System) and the COL PWS (Portable Workstation) laptops.
 
 Afterwards, TJ had ~4 hrs of work in the Lab, uninstalling &amp; disassembling the TeSS (Temporary Sleep Station) in Bay S1, then packing &amp; labeling the hardware for stowage.  The radiation-protection “bricks” of the TeSS were relocated to the CQs (Crew Quarters and installed in specific configurations, mostly to protect head and torso of the occupant.    [The bricks were placed between the wall blanket and the wall itself to retain the Velcro attach points available in the CQs for crew use.]
 
 After charging the SONY HVR-Z1J camcorder battery yesterday, Kotov set up the hardware of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 for another experiment run, then initiated the planned GFI-1 activities.  About two hours later, the gear was closed out and removed.    [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #9, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
 In line with the recent outfitting of the RS (Russian Segment) with the new BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) network in the SM (started on 2/11), Oleg today installed new control software on the RSS1 laptop, then downloaded the BRI log file for downlink to TsUP via OCA for data evaluation. 
 
 Afterwards, the CDR reconfigured the REGUL-Packet radiogram channel from REGUL-OS/string 1to work with string 2, a periodic alternating task.
 
 Later, Oleg performed the periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), verifying proper function of its recent (3/29) setup by taking readings with the LULIN-5 electronics box.
 
 Next, Kotov conducted periodic maintenance on the deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System behind panel 449 by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new unit from FGB stowage (done last: 2/22/10).    [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
 The CDR also completed a periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 Noguchi had another 3 hrs set aside for generic gathering &amp; prepacking cargo for return in the 19A MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) “Leonardo”.
 
 In the US Airlock, Soichi “degassed” three PWRs (Payload Water Reservoirs, #1005, #1025, #1007), i.e., manually removed gas bubbles (by self-centrifugation) to minimize the amount of air introduced into the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) feedwater tanks, and also checked the A/L floor bins for a missing PWR (#1015).     [The traditional procedure for “degassing” the container by first draining, then refilling it with a fully charged water CWC was replaced in 2004 by a rather ingenious new procedure developed and checked out on the KC-135 aircraft flying zero-G parabolas at JSC/Houston: Essentially, it involves the crewmember himself centrifuging the selected container by holding it away from the body and applying a slow rotation of ~15 rpm to himself, to separate air and water in the bag through centrifugal force, while simultaneously squeezing out the air by cinching down on bungee cords wrapped around the CWC.]
 
 Oleg conducted another photography &amp; video session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining data on color bloom patterns I n the Central-Eastern Atlantic waters, then copying the images &amp; audio files of his commentary to the RSK-1 laptop.
 
 At ~8:50am EDT, Kotov &amp; Noguchi supported a PAO TV event on the occasion of the Russian “Step into the Future” Olympiad, exchanging Q/As with graduating high-school students assembled at TsUP-Moscow.     [The “Step into the Future” Olympiad in cosmonautics for school children is being held from 3/30 through 4/6 at Moscow Bauman State Technical University.]
 
 The crew performed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6). 
 
 Soyuz Launch:    Countdown for the launch of Soyuz TMA-18/22S tonight at 12:04am EDT is proceeding nominally.  Today, the Russian State Commission held its L-1 meeting at the Baikonur launch site, approving and confirming the primary and backup crews for TMA-18 on the recommendation of the Head of the GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) Sergei K. Krikalev, and the readiness of the space launcher system.  22S will carry the Exp-23 crewmembers Alexander Alexandrovich Skvortsov (Russia), Mikhail Borisovich Kornienko (Russia) &amp; Tracy Caldwell Dyson (USA).

 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (the capital city Bishkek with a population now approaching 1 million is the largest city in Kyrgyzstan.  It is located just north of the Kirgizskiy Mountains and to the NW of Lake Issyk Kul.  Clear weather approach was from the NW in early afternoon lighting.  Looking nadir for this urban target at the base of the mountains), Ashgabat, Turkmenistan (ISS had a mid-afternoon, near-nadir pass over this target in fair weather.  Literally translated, Ashgabat means "Lovely City".  With a population nearing 1 million, the city is located between the Kara Kum desert and the Kopet Dag mountain range.  After crossing the Caspian Sea the crew was to begin looking for the city on the north side of the Kopet Dag Mountains), Doha, Qatar (ISS had a mid-afternoon pass in clear weather over this target.  As the crew tracked southeastward along the west coast of the Persian Gulf, they were to look nadir for the capital city of Qatar.  Doha, with a population of over a million, is located on the east coast of the peninsula comprising Qatar), Lake Nasser, Toshka Lakes, Egypt (the Toshka Lakes formed in the late 1990’s when record high water in the Nile River and Lake Nasser spilled out into desert depressions to the west.  Since then the lakes have persisted, but continue to slowly dry up.  The crew was to update the existing CEO monitoring record of this event with nadir context views of the lakes, looking for them at nadir as they approached the Nile River valley from the NW.  It was mid-afternoon with clear weather expected), N'Djamena, Chad (this capital city of about 1 million is located on the SW border of the country at the confluence of the Chari and Logone rivers and about 75 miles southeast of Lake Chad.  As ISS tracked southeastward over Lake Chad in late afternoon with fair weather, the crew was to begin looking nadir for this low-contrast target), and Bamako, Mali (fair weather was expected for this nadir pass in late-afternoon light.  The capital city of Mali is located on the Niger River in the southwestern part of the country.  Tracking southeastward into the western Sahel region from the desert, the crew was to look for this city of nearly 2 million astride the Niger River).
