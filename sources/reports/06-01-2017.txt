SpaceX (SpX)-11 Launch: SpX-11 is scheduled to launch today at 4:55 pm CDT. Pending a successful launch, capture and berthing are planned for Sunday, June 4th at 9:00am CDT.
Rodent Research-5 (RR-5):  The crew unpacked, installed and configured four Animal Habitats and configured the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) for RR-5 operations to be performed after arrival of rodents and additional hardware and materials on SpaceX-11. The Ground team successfully completed a software checkout of all the Habitats.
DOSIS 3D:  The crew de-installed DOSIS 3D passive detectors and handed them over to a Russian crewmember for packing for return on Soyuz 49S.  Data from the various active and passive radiation detectors are used in the determination of the radiation field parameters absorbed doses and dose equivalents inside the ISS. A concise three dimensional (3D) dose distribution map of all the segments of the ISS will be developed based on this data and data from JAXA and NASA monitoring devices.
Matiss:  The crew de-installed the four Matiss Sample Holders from the Columbus module for return on 49S.  The MATISS experiment investigates the antibacterial properties of materials in space to see if future spacecraft could be made easier to clean. The experiment aims to understand the mechanisms of attachment of biofilms in microgravity conditions. MATISS objectives include simplification of decontamination operations to save crew time and validation of innovative surfaces for use in future spacecraft.
ISS Change of Command: In preparation for 49S departure on Friday, Peggy Whitson handed over command of the ISS to Fyodor Yurchikhin. During this event, the entire crew discussed with Mission Control Center (MCC)-Houston and MCC-Moscow Flight Control their roles and responsibilities for the timeframe between the Change of Command event and tomorrow’s 49S departure.  Following the Change of Command, the new Commander’s Soyuz crew became prime for emergencies.
