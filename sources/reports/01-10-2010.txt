ISS On-Orbit Status 01/10/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sunday – Crew rest day.    Ahead: Week 7 of Increment 22.
 
 FE-1 Suraev began the day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by Maxim on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 After breakfast, CDR Williams &amp; FE-5 Noguchi supported the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
 FE-1 Suraev conducted the periodic maintenance on the deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new unit from FGB stowage (done last: 10/19/09), then reactivating the unit (the old filter was discarded).
 
 In the Soyuz TMA-16/20S spacecraft, docked at the SM (Service Module) Aft port, Maxim turned off the spacecraft’s gas analyzer which he had activated on 1/7, a periodic procedure to monitor the atmosphere of the CRV (Crew Return Vehicle).
 
 FE-4 Kotov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.
 
 The CDR performed the monthly inspection of the T2/COLBERT treadmill system and its components, inspecting pin alignment, rack centering and the snubber jam nut witness marks.    [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- &amp; Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm.  Their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.]
 
 On the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab, the FE-6 removed the alignment guides to allow activation of the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) by the ground for FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility) operations requiring a microgravity environment.
 
 Shortly before sleep time, Suraev will set up the Russian MBI-12 Sonokard payload and start his seventh experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 The voluntary US “job jar” task list for TJ, Jeff &amp; Soichi for today showed –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>the periodic replacement of the EDV-U urine container in the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), and</li><li>troubleshooting of the Robotics DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) computer application set-up which had been unable to receive (and display) real telemetered joint angle data during the recent SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) activity.</li></ul> 
 The Russian discretionary task list for Maxim &amp; Oleg for today called for –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>another session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the Nikon D3X digital camera, and</li><li>a photography run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X with SIGMA AF 300-800mm telelens of glaciers &amp; icebergs in the vicinity of the Kerguelen Islands, Heard Island, the area of the Crozet Islands, general scenic photography of the Andes with emphasis on the western Chilean slope, and Patagonian ledniki (glaciers), and Glaciers of South Georgia Islands glaciers.</li> </ul> 
 CDR, FE-1, FE-4, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Maxim at ~5:00am, Oleg at ~6:35am, Soichi at ~11:05am, Jeff at ~2:30pm, TJ at ~4:05pm EST.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).
 
 No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
