ISS On-Orbit Status 06/22/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   
 
 FE-3 Kornienko began the day with the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 At wake-up, FE-2 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson continued her current session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 With Part 1 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol begun yesterday, FE-6 Shannon Walker today went on to Part 2 (of 3), recording post-sleep data of the crew-worn acoustic dosimeters and then deploying the dosimeters statically, one (#1013) in the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), one (#1011) in Node-2 and the third (#1012) in the MRM1 Rassvet module, away from air flow and taking photographs of the locations.  Part 3 will involve recording the data taken by the three static dosimeters.    [Acoustic data must be taken twice per Increment, each time for the duration of the 16-hour crew workday.] 
 
 FE-4 Doug Wheelock started out by working on the WRS (Water Recovery System) in the Lab, supplementing the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly / Waste Water Tank) with stored water from an EDV container, emptying it (~15 minutes).     [The task requires assembling, connecting &amp; activating the FTP (Fluid Transfer Pump), powered from ER6 (EXPRESS Rack 6), to transfer condensate to the Waste Water Bus.  Transfer duration depends on storage bag quantity (0.5 L/min).]
 
 Afterwards, Wheelock prepared for his first session with the medical Pro K protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), configuring his FD15 (Flight Day 15) diet plan by organizing Pro K food selection per his preference.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 FE-5 Fyodor Yurchikhin initiated charging the battery for the SONY HVR-Z1J camcorder for the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment, assembled &amp; installed the payload hardware and later conducted the recording session from SM Service Module) window #4 at a specific time (12:55pm-1:05pm EDT), observing thunderstorm radiation spectra.  Afterwards, the equipment was taken down and stowed.    [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment is designed for spectral observations of the Earth atmosphere and surface, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  Today’s thunderstorm measurements involved UV-range measurement of formations radiation during global electro-magnetic processes in the upper atmosphere.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
 Preparatory to the installation of a new BSK-2 power switching unit in the SM, CDR Skvortsov checked out the current status of the new BRI Smart Switch Router computer and ASP Network Connection Adapter, installed last February, recording &amp; downlinking network configuration, cable connections and log files before their deactivation.
 
 With BITS2-12 onboard telemetry turned off, Skvortsov afterwards moved the BRI out of the way behind panel 229A to access the BSK-2 which he then replaced with a new spare.  After mating all connections, BRI was moved back in place.
 
 Then, the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator was reactivated by ground commanding, with the CDR monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.    [The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup. Elektron had to be turned off while BITS2-12 &amp; VD-SU were off for the BSK-2 replacement.]
 
 Later in the day, after BRI &amp; ASP had run for a while, the CDR dumped their status log files for function verification and then performed a check (“ping” test) of the communications between all network users after installation of the BSK-2.
 
 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson set up all PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware, including MBS (Mixing Bag System), powered it up and then spent several hours performing her 3<sup>rd</sup> session with the VO<sub>2</sub>Max assessment, integrated with Thermolab.  Later, she downloaded the data, including Thermolab, to a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop, powered down, cleaned up and temporarily moved all hardware aside for subsequent operation by Wheels &amp; Shannon next week.     [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>Max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
 Later, Tracy returned to the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to continue her support of the CSLM-2 (Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures 2) experiment, now for the new SPU (Sample Processing Unit) #4, installed yesterday.    [Task steps included inspecting, activating &amp; checking the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) for acceptable humidity &amp; temperature levels in the sample chamber, followed by opening the water valve, then closing it and opening the vent valve to initiate the 3<sup>rd</sup> of 4 vacuum draws on the sample chamber.  Vacuum vent #4 is to be started later in the day, after again letting the water line vent into the work volume for a while.]
 
 Alex Skvortsov, assisted by FE-3 Kornienko, took the periodic (generally monthly) health test with the cardiological experiment PZEh MO-1 (“Study of the Bioelectric Activity of the Heart at Rest”) on exercise equipment, his second session.     [Equipment used were VPG/Temporal Pulsogram and 8-channel ECG/Electrocardiogram Data Output Devices (USI).  The tests took place during RGS (Russian Groundsite) overflight windows (at 1:18pm) via VHF for data downlink from the VPG and Gamma-1M ECG for about 5-6 minutes.]
 
 With its AIP-01 battery freshly charged overnight, Kornienko performed another sun-glint observation session with the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) experiment from SM window #9, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with a coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloading the data to laptop RSE1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.  Video footage was also taken, using the SONY HVR-Z7E camcorder in auto mode.     [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere],
 
 Later, Mikhail also initiated overnight charging of the KPT-2 KELVIN battery for the new Piren-B Pyro-endoscope for the BAR experiment.
 
 Fyodor Yurchikhin again had ~1h set aside for transferring cargo from Soyuz TMA-19/23S and stowing it aboard ISS, guided by an uplinked 23S cargo stowage plan listing 63 individual items, and logging moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System).
 
 Observed by Fyodor as part of crew handover activities, Mikhail performed the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.
 
 Today’s scheduled installation of the WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) at the science window in the US Lab represented a major outfitting task for Doug Wheelock &amp; Shannon Walker, requiring about 6h 5m total man-hours.     [For Part 1, both crewmembers were needed for the major WORF rack installation, such as rack rotation down to install seals, removing SAM (Shutter Actuator Mechanism) cover plus Air Knife cotter pins &amp; launch restraint bolts, installing knee brace, etc.  Afterwards, Shannon continued alone with Part 2, installing a lower restraint &amp; bumpshield, adjusting SAM &amp; Air Knife, wrapping up with post-maintenance, etc.   Background:   WORF, which surrounds the 20-inch Lab science window, serves for attaching sensors (cameras, multispectral scanners, and other instruments).  It provides attachment points and power &amp; data transfer capability for instruments to be mounted in the window.  Multiple instruments can be mounted at the same time.  The rack is designed to allow rapid changes of equipment by the crew.  WORF has a bracket for small cameras such as 35mm, 70mm and camcorders.  Larger payloads requiring nonstandard attachment or additional instrument isolation must supply their own brackets or platforms which mount to the WORF using available attachment points.  WORF also provides protection for the interior of the Lab window and can control stray light exchange between the Lab interior and the external station environment.]
 
 FE-3 completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Misha also did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 In the Lab, Wheels re-installed the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides (3) on the FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility) in the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to protect the rack from external loading events such as dockings &amp; undockings.
 
 After activating the GA gas analyzer in the Soyuz TMA-19 yesterday, Skvortsov went back in the spacecraft today and used a watch repair screwdriver to adjust/calibrate the O<sub>2</sub> sensor element setting (to ppO<sub>2</sub> = 160-165 mmHg), then verifying if “no change”.
 
 The three Russian crewmembers joined up for a 1-hr period of RS (Russian Segment) E23-E24 handovers, getting Fyodor up to speed.
 
 Likewise, crew handovers for the USOS (US Segment) were on Tracy’s, Wheels’ &amp; Shannon’s schedule for today, for the benefit two E24 newcomers.
 
 FE-4, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 again had several hours set aside for crew onboard orientation &amp; adaptation.     [The first two weeks after their arrival, a new ISS crew will have 1 hour a day to adjust to living in space.  Additional time is allotted for getting around in the – by now – extensive new “home in space” and working with its valuable research equipment.]
 
 Alexander set up the video equipment on a bracket in Node-3 for subsequently recording his and Mikhail’s exercise session on the ARED exerciser, as required every 30 days.    [The video was to capture a full body side view with feet toward the bottom of the frame.] 
 
 The full crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-4, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).    [For his TVIS workout, Yurchikhin used the TVIS SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices) tailored for him.  The protective SPDs are required for new crewmembers for the first seven TVIS sessions for safety.  This was Fyodor’s 2<sup>nd</sup> session.]
 
 All crewmembers had their PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video (the 4<sup>th</sup> for the newcomers), Shannon at ~7:45am, Fyodor at ~10:05am, Misha at ~12:15pm, Sasha at ~12:30pm, Doug at ~1:20pm, Tracy at ~1:40pm EDT.
 
 Later today, at ~4:10pm, Mikhail Kornienko will use the ISS amateur radio equipment for a ham radio session with participants of the 9<sup>th</sup> International Camp/Rally of Slavic Fellowship, being held at Tuapse, a great sea port of Krasnodar Province at the Black Sea, with 500 representatives from Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Montenegro.
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation):  Over the next week or so there will be fewer CEO targets in the target list.  This is due to the crew’s daylight/awake orbits paralleling the terminator.  This phenomenon occurs at least twice a year, sometimes more – during the high-Beta angle period.  During this time the sun elevations for nadir targets will be too low to meet requirements for many, but not all, of the targets.  The crew see darkness if they look to the left of the orbit tracks; to the right they see sunlight. This typically lasts for about a week before sun angles improve for CEO nadir targets.  For the station, high Beta also means critically increased solar thermal input.
 
 CEO photo targets uplinked for today were Gaborone, Botswana (Gaborone is located at the Notwane River in the southeastern corner of Botswana.  The city is located to the north of a reservoir and to the northeast of dark hills.  Context imagery of the city and immediate surroundings was requested), Johannesburg, South Africa (Johannesburg lies in the middle of a 100-mile-long string of gold-mining cities.  From orbit the cities appear mainly as numerous "mine dumps" of light-toned mine waste.  Shooting margins of the built-up areas.  Cities are located where the gold reef was originally discovered outcropping at the surface.  Mine dumps outside main area are located at younger, very deep mines that reach the gold reef two miles and more below the surface), and Polar Mesospheric Clouds/PMCs (the peak of PMCs occurs about 20 days after the summer solstice.  Our northern hemisphere summer solstice occurred 6/21.  ISS/CEO has already successfully captured some of these clouds on 6/16.  While over the coast of Libya the crew detected the clouds looking north over Europe.  PMCs exist high in the Earth’s atmosphere [about 80 km] at the edge of space and sometimes become visible just after sunset).
