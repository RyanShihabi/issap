Boeing CST-100 Crewed Flight Test (CFT): Today, the CFT crew assisted the ISS crew by completing the ongoing Plant Water Management 6 (PWM-6) activities.
Payloads:
Plant Ultraviolet-B (Plant UV-B): A laptop was connected and setup in preparation for future Plant UV-B operations. More information on this experiment can be found here.
Plant Water Management 6 (PWM-6): The crew performed various Root tests with PWM-6 hardware. The tests will model roots that imitate various absorption rates. More about this experiment can be found here.
Zero Robotics-Astrobee: The crew positioned the Astrobee Free Flyer in the JEM and assisted the ground team in conducting multiple gesture-recognition software test runs. This set of maneuvers is a part of a competition dry run for UAE Zero Robotics Programming Challenge (UAE ZRPC). More information on this experiment can be found here.
Systems:
N3 Moderate Temperature Loop (MTL) Gas Trap Plug replacement: The N3 MTL Gas Trap Plug was replaced following the Fluid System Servicer (FSS) operations completed last week.  The MTL is one of the cooling loops that make up the overall Internal thermal Control System (ITCS) of the ISS.  The ITCS provides equipment cooling and heat rejection through a combination of water loops and heat exchangers.
General Stowage Management: The crew took inventory of and reorganized different sections of the ISS. Hardware related to the toilet system was collected and reorganized to improve stowage efficiency for future operations.  Several members of the crew worked in the Lab to organize and manage stowage, including disposal of unneeded common trash and relocating items as needed for the betterment of day-to-day operations.
