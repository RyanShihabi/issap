ISS On-Orbit Status 11/05/11November 05, 2011
ISS On-Orbit Status 11/05/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty. After wakeup, FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection. In the Lab, Fossum serviced the EarthKAM (EKAM/Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack, changing battery after wakeup.  Later in the day, Mike shut down the EKAM equipment, removed it to stowage and also returned the SSC-21 (Station Support Computer 21) T61p laptop to its original place in Node-2 (D5).  During this session, 8,830 participating students from 133 schools (111 US and 22 international) requested images via the web-based system managed at the University of California, San Diego.      [EK uses a NIKON D2Xs electronic still camera with 50mm and 180mm lenses, powered by a battery, taking pictures by remote operation from the ground, without crew interaction.  It is available for students who submit image requests and conduct geographic research.  The requests are uplinked in a camera control file to the T61p SSC-21 (Station Support Computer) laptop which then activates the camera at specified times and receives the digital images from the camera’s storage card on its hard drive, for subsequent downlink via OpsLAN.  The camera battery is changed when no pictures are being taken.  EKAM uses new software on SSC-21 which replaces the version used for the DCS 760 camera. This is the 3rd use of the D2Xs camera by EKAM.  Students around the world are delighted with the use of the higher resolution images.] The CDR also checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera & flashlight battery charge and again 8 hrs later at midday and before sleeptime.  The Nikon D2Xs camera with EarthKAM software running with the Intervalometer on SSC-18 is taking automated flash photography.       [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking one photo each hour of Sample 2 (since 11/2).  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.] Fossum, Furukawa & Volkov joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the Potok Air Purification System pre-filters in SM & FGB.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection. In early preparation for his return to gravity on 11/8, Sergey Volkov underwent his first preliminary Chibis ODNT exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the T2 treadmill, with Satoshi Furukawa assisting him as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  For the 55-min exercise, monitored from the ground via telemetry (6:13am EDT), Sergey wore the GAMMA-1 system and the REG ShKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap.      [ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system after his long-term stay in zero-G.  The preparatory training consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -15, -20, -25, -30 mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.] Later, the Russian Flight Engineer unpacked & deployed new 45P-arrived RODF (Russian Operations Data Files) documents.      [This involved updates for the books/material on Medical Operations (MO Books 1 & 2), Technical Experiments (TE), Geophysics (GF), Biotechnology (BTKh), PHOTO, TORU, Video & Audio (ViA), Manual Controls (RSU), Onboard Computer System (BVS), Guidance, Navigation and Control System (SUDN), Life Support System (SOZh), Atmosphere Revitalization System (SOGS), Pressure Control & Atmosphere Monitoring System (SKDS), FGB IFM IVA (PTO VnuKD), Transfer Ops (RPR), Progress 413 Transfer Ops (RPR TKG 413), plus the DVD with the video on “Deployment of jettison container with Chibis-M microsatellite”]. At ~8:45am EDT, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-4, FE-5). Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –Continuing the preparation & downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the Laganakskoe plateau, Krasnaya Polyana, Kolka Glacier, Volga River delta, the Caspian Sea, Mount Etna, Allalin Glacier, Ugra National Park, Volcano Huascaran, Darwin Island, and the Volcanoes Arenal, Poas and San Cristobal (monitoring possible activity),Conducting the daily inspection of the running Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 & A24 root modules, andAnother ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop. Conjunction Update:     FCT/Flight Controller Team has been tracking a new conjunction with Object #30353 (Fengyun 1C Debris).  TCA (Time of Closest Approach): 11/6 (Sunday), 1:31pm EST.  The object’s miss distance has remained outside of the notification box for the past few updates.  The PC (Probability of Collision) is now valid (meeting all criteria) and well below any action threshold.  No action is necessary by the FCT or the crew.  Time Change:   The change from Daylight Saving Time to Standard Time will occur tomorrow, 11/6, at 2:00am (local time).  Clocks should be set BACK 1 hour.
