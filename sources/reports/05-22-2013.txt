Russian Treadmill (БД-2) Outfitting: ISS Commander (CDR) Vinogradov and Flight Engineer (FE)-2 Misurkin completed the installation of the БД-2.  Ground specialists will evalaute pictures and a video that the crew downlinked earlier today.  The crew is scheduled to perform a БД-2 checkout tomorrow.
Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE) Vane Gap-1 (VG-1): FE-3 Cassidy used a CFE-2 vessel to observe fluid interface and critical wetting behavior in a cylindrical chamber with elliptic cross-section and an adjustable central perforated vane. The primary objective of the Vane Gap experiments is to determine equilibrium interface configurations and critical wetting conditions for interfaces between interior corners separated by a gap.
Ham Radio Pass: Cassidy talked to students in the seventh through twelfth grades at Anacapa School in Santa Barbara, CA using the Ham radio located in the Columbus module. Topics included life in space and requirements to become an astronaut.
