Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Mobility Unit (EMU) Troubleshooting: Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy and FE-6 Nyberg performed a series of EMU troubleshooting steps on EMU 3011 to investigate the likely causes of the water issue experienced by FE-5 Parmitano during EVA 23.  This troubleshooting investigated the functionality of the fan, pump, and water separator.  Additionally, Cassidy and Nyberg dried out the EMU vent loop to determine if the EMU is able to support future loop scrub maintenance activity.  During troubleshooting, ground specialists did not see any off nominal signatures or any unexpected water leakage. Ground specialists continue to review data to determine future steps. 
Surface Telerobotics: Parmitano executed the second of three sessions of Surface Telerobotics.  Parmitano will control robots located at NASA Ames Research Center. The objective of the Surface Telerobotics is to examine how the crew can effectively tele-operate ground robots from orbit while constrained by factors related to the space environment, crew vehicle resources and communications.  This operation will obtain baseline engineering data, validate and correlate prior ground simulations, and reduce the risk that architecture/mission planning is based on inaccurate assumptions. 
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: Today, Robotics Ground performed a Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) walkoff to Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF) 2.  During the walkoff, ground controllers performed checkout and diagnostics of the joints and end effector.  The planned walkoff was in preparation of H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)-4 Rendezvous and Offset Grapple training sessions planned for next week and in preparation for the HTV-4 capture and berthing planned for August 9th.  MSS performance was nominal.
