H-II Transfer Vehicle 9 (HTV9) Departure Operations:  The crew closed the HTV hatch and configured the vestibule for unberthing by removing the Intramodular Ventilation (IMV) supply jumper and power/data jumpers. They installed the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) Controller Panel Assemblies (CPAs) and partially installed a hatch thermal blanket. The crew also worked ahead of today’s timeline and mounted the Pressure Management Device (PMD) and connected associated power and data cables. The PMD setup was originally scheduled on the timeline tomorrow. HTV9 is scheduled for unberth and release tomorrow.
Environmental Health System (EHS) Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA) Water Recovery System (WRS) Sample Analysis & Data Record: Crew performed an analysis of the water processing assembly (WPA) using the TOCA. The TOCA unit oxidizes organic carbon species present in the water to carbon dioxide gas and measures the concentration using nondispersive infrared spectroscopy. Analysis of the potable water using the TOCA occurs on a weekly basis. The crew also replaced the TOCA Waste Water Bag (WWB) to preclude overfill.
Regenerative Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) Recycle Tank Drain/Fill: Today the crew set up the recycle tank to drain to a ЕДВ-У. Following the setup the ground performed the tank drain using the Urine Transfer System (UTS). Once the ground specialists completed the transfer, the crew verified the recycle tank was empty, terminated the drain, and repositioned the fill/drain valve to fill.
