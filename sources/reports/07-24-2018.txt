Rodent Research-7 (RR-7): The crew completed the first of two days of rodent operations for the RR-7 investigation today. Crewmembers performed bone densitometer scans, blood draws, fecal pellet collections, and sampling operations.  RR-7 examines how the space environment affects the community of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract of mice (also known as the microbiota). It also looks at microgravity’s effects on multiple physiological systems known to be affected by the microbiota, including the gastrointestinal, immune, metabolic, circadian, and sleep systems. These studies should help explain mechanisms underlying interactions between these systems and the role of the microbiota in these interactions. 
Exposed Experiment Handrail Attachment Mechanism (ExHAM) #1: Tonight robotic specialists in Tsukuba will use the Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS) with the Small Fine Arm (SFA) to transfer the Handhold Experiment Platform (HXP) from the JEM Airlock Slide Table to the JEM Exposed Facility handrail. 
Treadmill 2 (T2) Status: This morning, the crew replaced the T2 Station Support Computer (SSC) and the ground team configured it for T2 use.  The subsequent rack activation was nominal and T2 is now operational and ‘Go’ for the crew’s use. 
Dragon Cargo Ops: Today the crew completed approximately four hours of cargo operations as they continued to pack and load items slated for return on the SpaceX-15 Dragon vehicle. Only a few steps remain in the current Cargo Message and specialists hope to upload the next message tomorrow. An estimated fifteen hours of activities remain to finish loading the vehicle prior to the planned departure date of 3 August.
