USOS 3A ISS Roll Out Solar Array (IROSA) Install Extravehicular Activity (EVA): This past weekend on Saturday EV1 (Josh Cassada) and EV2 (Frank Rubio) conducted USOS EVA #82. The main goal of this EVA was to install and deploy the 3A IROSA and perform a 1B cable demate. Hatch opening occurred at 6:16 AM CT. The final Phase Elapsed Time (PET) from today’s EVA was 7 hours and 5 minutes and the crew completed the following objectives:

Release IROSA from FSE
Install IROSA on S4 3A Mast Canister
Connect IROSA Electrical Connectors
Deploy S4 3A IROSA
1B Cable Demate
Release FSE Restraint Bolts on 4A IROSA (Get-Ahead)

Payloads:
Kubik 5 and 6 Deinstall:  Following the completion of the Osteogenic Cells experiment, the crew deinstalled Kubik 5 from COL1D1 and Kubik 6 from COL1D2, and stowed them.  Exposure of the human body to microgravity conditions during long-duration spaceflight results in the loss of bone mass, especially in weight-bearing bones, with conditions resembling that of disuse osteoporosis. The general understanding of the underlying processes state that bone formation is decreased, whereas bone resorption remains unaltered, or is slightly increased. The main goal of the Osteogenic Cells investigation is to study whether the gravity response is restricted to a particular osteogenic cell type, and whether the composition of Extra-Cellular Matrix (ECM) affects, or even rescues, the gravity-response in the formation of bone cells (osteoblasts).
Systems:
Post EVA Activities: Today, the crew terminated charging on Li-Ion Batteries using EVA battery operations terminal. This is done in preparation for the upcoming 4A IROSA EVA. The crew also terminated the first cycle of Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Metal Oxide (METOX) regeneration. Following this, a second METOX regeneration cycle was initiated by baking out CO2 in the METOX regenerator oven.
