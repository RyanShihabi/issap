ISS On-Orbit Status 07/29/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday – Crew off duty.  Ahead:  Week 5 of Increment 32 (six-person crew).
 
For supporting the Progress M-15M/47P redocking, the crew has been split in two shifts:  
 
Crew 1 (Padalka, Revin, Malenchenko):
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Wake3 – 7:30am (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Sleep3 – 9:00pm (today) – CDR</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Sleep3 – 6:50pm (today) – FE-2, FE-4</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Wake4 – 2:00am (tomorrow) – returning to nominal.</li></ul> 
Crew 2 (Acaba, Williams, Hoshide):
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Wake3 – 3:30am (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Sleep3 – 5:30pm (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Wake4 – 2:00am (Wednesday) – returning to nominal.</li></ul> 
Progress M-15M/47P successfully re-docked last night at 9:01pm EDT at the DC1 Docking Compartment 1 nadir port, using the updated Kurs-NA avionics, followed by docking probe retraction and Progress hook closure at approximately 9:11pm.  The ISS returned to active attitude control at approximately 9:13pm under RS (Russian Segment) thruster control after closure of the DC1 docking hooks.    [Due to previous failures of the Kurs-NA avionics system on the previous docking attempt and subsequent testing, the Kurs-NA was thermally pre-conditioned to a temperature greater than 22 degC for this docking attempt.  Testing had shown that an increased operating temperature the Kurs-NA avionics allowed it to successfully complete self-test and transition to the operate mode.]
 
Automated approach &amp; docking was monitored from the SM by CDR Padalka &amp; FE-4 Malenchenko on the TORU manual teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system in case automated control was aborted.
 
After the cargo ship’s docking, Gennady &amp; Yuri shut off the TORU, and reconfigured the STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to normal ops.  The Russian crewmembers then started the standard one-hour leak checking of the docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and the DC1 SU vestibule.  Later, CDR &amp; FE-4 opened the hatches and installed the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling.  Afterwards, Gennady powered down the spacecraft and installed the ventilation/heating air duct.
 
While Yuri took out cargo to make room inside the cargo ship, Gennady is spending several hours in 47P to dismantle and remove the Kurs-NA avionics box for return to Russia for failure analysis.
 
Later tonight, Padalka &amp; Malenchenko will reverse the opening of the cargo ship, repacking the disposable cargo, installing the docking mechanism, activating the ship, removing the air duct, closing the hatches and performing the one-hour leak check. Final undocking of 47P is scheduled tomorrow, 7/30, at ~5:16pm EDT.
 
After their wake-up (3:30am), Joe Acaba, Sunita Williams &amp; Akihiko Hoshide joined in conducting their part of the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
Afterwards, Joe also conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 &amp; O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.
 
Sergei completed the routine daily &amp; weekly servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.     [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings of SM &amp; FGB for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers as required.]
 
FE-2 &amp; FE-3 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sergei at ~10:35am, Joe at ~3:30pm EDT.
 
The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). 
 
WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (32-0027C) lists 14 CWCs (236.8 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (4 CWCs with 167.3 L, plus 1 empty bag);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (3 CWCs with 55.5 L); and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
