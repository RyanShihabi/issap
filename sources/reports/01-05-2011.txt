ISS On-Orbit Status 01/05/11
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
 FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator, installed (by Maxim Suraev on 10/19/09) in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 CDR Kelly Scott continued his current week-long regimen with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Scott’s 5<sup>th</sup> session, transferring data from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, US crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 FE-5 Nespoli had Day 3 of his 2<sup>nd</sup> suite of sessions with the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict &amp; Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight &amp; Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  No special diet intact required.  His 24-hr urine collections begin tomorrow.     [For Pro K, there will be five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
 At wake-up, FE-1 Kaleri terminated his 7<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
 FE-6 Coleman set up and initiated recharge on the power tool batteries for her next ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session starting tomorrow.     [The four Makita batteries were charged in turn during the day.] 
 
 Cady also initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.       [This was the 8<sup>th</sup> session with the newly replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 FE-4 Kondratyev continued the current round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today inspecting &amp; cleaning “Group B2” ventilator fans &amp; grilles in the SM (Service Module).
 
 FE-1 Kaleri conducted another active session for the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), then downlinked video footage obtained with two SONY HVR-Z1J camcorders, in two parts sequenced to RGS (Russian Groundsite) passes (4:36am &amp; 6:10am EST).      [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS (Russian Segment): condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
 In Node-3, CDR Kelly continued the 2-year maintenance/overhaul of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), which took most of his working hours today.  Before commencing work by powering down the WHC and removing panels, Scott installed the T2/COLBERT alignment guides to secure the treadmill for the following removal of the WHC Kabin enclosure.  FE-5 Nespoli assisted during the Kabin removal &amp; temporary transfer to Node-1, and also later with its re-installation.  After the IFM (Inflight Maintenance), the T2 guides were removed, and FE-6 Coleman performed WHC closeout by replacing its panels.      [The WHC 2-Year Changeout replaces urine lines, pressure sensors and the Urine Valve Block; these are yearly tasks and were performed last year.  Also replaced will be water lines, pressure sensors, and the Water Valve Block; these 2-year tasks have never been performed on WHC as yet.  The procedure includes a corrective maintenance activity to remove the internal UMS (Urine Monitoring System) line that was found to be contaminated with microbial growth during Inc-24.  UMS will arrive on ULF5, along with a new adapter.  Finally, the piping between the Pretreat &amp; Water Pump and the Pump Separator needs to be changed out.]
 
 FE-2 Skripochka &amp; FE-4 Kondratyev continued the periodic inspection &amp; photo-documentation of RS window panes which they began yesterday.    [Attention is specifically on windows 1, 2, 3, 5, 13, 14, 26 in the SM and VL1 (EV hatch 1) &amp; VL2 (EV hatch 2) in the DC1 Docking Compartment &amp; in the MRM2 Poisk module.  The observed defects were recorded in image and text files on the RSK1 laptop for subsequent downlink via U.S. OCA assets.     [Objective of the inspection, which uses a digital still camera (Nikon D1X w/SB-28DX flash) and voice recorder, was to assess the window pane surfaces for any changes (new cavities, scratches, new or expanded old stains or discolorations affecting transparency properties) since the last inspection.  The new assessment will be compared to earlier observations.  Defects on the currently  are measured with the parallax method which uses eyeball-sighting with a ruler and a right isosceles triangle to determine the defects' size and position with respect to the window's internal surface (parallax being the apparent change in an object's position resulting from changing the observer's position).]
 
 Continuing readiness preparations for a contingency EVA to support HTV2 (H-II Transfer Vehicle) berthing on 1/27, Nespoli &amp; Coleman had an hour set aside to review ECWS OBT (EMU Caution &amp; Warning Simulator Onboard Trainer) procedures &amp; material and use the ECWS trainer for a refresher.
 
 Afterwards, Paolo worked in the US Airlock on EMUs #3005 &amp; #3010 to perform the regular Week 15 loop scrub, i.e., setting them up with their SCUs (Service &amp; Cooling Umbilicals) and initiating the standard one-hour scrubbing process on the spacesuits’ and Airlock’s cooling water loops, filtering ionic and particulate matter (via a 3-micron filter), then reconfiguring the cooling loops and starting the ~2hr biocide (iodination) filtering.      [The activity checked out and prepared the suits for a contingency HTV2 EVA and met their periodic maintenance requirements.  Loop scrubbing, incl. iodination of the LCVGs (Liquid Cooling &amp; Ventilation Garments) for biocidal maintenance is done to eliminate any biomass and particulate matter that may have accumulated in the loops.]
 
 FE-5 also started his first session (of 3 total) with the JAXA experiment “Biological Rhythms” (BIORHYTHMS), for which he donned the electrodes of the DWH (Digital Walk Holter) for ECG (Electro-Cardiogram) recording, then initiated the data take for the next 24 hrs.
 
 In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Paolo supported ground operations by powering up the EPM (European Physiology Module)’s 28V laptop from the LUDB (Left Utility Distribution Panel).
 
 FE-6 Coleman completed servicing the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) galley fridge, today installing 2 fresh desiccant packs after letting the cooler dry out for 24 hrs.    [MERLIN is used for cold storage of crew food and drink.]
 
 In JAXA’s Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Cady supported ground-controlled operations on the CBEF IUs (Cell Biology Experiment Facility / Incubator Units) by removing one MEU-B (Measurement Experiment Unit B) from IU Micro-G and 2 MEU-Bs from IU 1G.
 
 Other activities completed by Cady Coleman afterwards included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>The regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks),</li><li>The periodic inspection of the PEPs (Portable Emergency Provisions), checking PFEs (Portable Fire Extinguishers, PBAs (Portable Breathing Apparatus), EHTKs (Extension Hose Tee Kits) and QDMA (Quick-Don Mask Assembly) harnesses  [PFEs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in A/L (Airlock), 2 in Lab,1 in Node-2, 1 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 1 in JLP, 2 in COL.  PBA O<sub>2</sub> Bottles: 4 in Node-1, 5 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 2 in COL.  QDMAs: 4 in Node-1, 8 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in Node-3, 2 in JPM, 2 in COL.  EHTKs: 1 in Node-1, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 1 in Node-3 ],</li><li>Unstowing the 3 copies of the “ULF4” Warning Book (Lab, SM, FGB) and making P&amp;I (pen &amp; ink) changes regarding recent replacements of UOPs (Utility Outlet Panels) with UOP bypass cables  [deferred from 1/3],</li><li>Completing her first onboard session with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application,   [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies],</li><li>Setting up the gear for Paolo’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Pro K 24-hr urine collections, starting tomorrow, and</li><li>Verifying (and correcting if necessary), the T2 treadmill network settings to help ground specialists troubleshoot T2 display network issues.</li> </ul> 
 Nespoli &amp; Coleman performed the periodic module hatch seal inspection, each taking ~35 min.    [FE-6 checked the hatches at Node-2 starboard, port &amp; aft, FE-5 the hatches of JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Element) and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), zenith &amp; starboard.]
 
 Alex again spent several hours on transferring &amp; loading disposal cargo in Progress M-08M/40P, scheduled for undocking on 1/24.
 
 Afterwards, Kaleri continued work on the BSPN Payload Server in SM, which had received new software recently to upgrade the BSPN’s HDD (Hard Disk Drive) backup partitions.  Today Sasha upgraded the software on the backup channel.
 
 FE-1 also conducted the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization).    [This is primarily an inspection of the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.]
 
 Kondratyev worked for about 2 hrs with Skripochka in partial fulfillment of regular crew handover requirements.
 
 Oleg, with Dmitri assisting as handover, completed the periodic transfer of condensate water to an RS EDV container for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis into oxygen &amp; hydrogen, filling the designated KOV (condensate water) EDV container from 2 CWCs (Contingency Water Containers, #1008, #1069).  When filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.     [The ~40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the Elektron’s BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles are detected in the EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.]
 
 FE-4 also undertook the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors/meters in the various RS hatchways, skipping the Soyuz hatch.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 FE-2 meanwhile completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Oleg also did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Nespoli conducted the periodic PIP (Plug-in Plan) inventory/audit (inventarisatsiya) in CQ1 (Crew Quarters 1) and CQ4, recording serial numbers of CSL (Crew Support LAN [Local Areas Network] and SSC (Station Support Computer) power chains.     [The regularly updated PIP shows which load is plugged in which outlet.  The most recent update: yesterday’s removal of TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) from Kibo.]
 
 Before sleeptime, FE-2 Skripochka will set up the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 8<sup>th</sup> Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 At ~10:10am EST, Paolo Nespoli supported an ESA PAO TV event from COL, responding to interviewer’s questions from RAI 1 TV News, Rome, Italy (Giancarlo Magalli). 
 
 Robotics Update:   The SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) “Dextre” has now been stowed on MBS PDGF (Mobile Base System / Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture) #2 via ground control.  These operations were in preparation for HTV2 operations later this month.  All checkouts were completed successfully, although several of SPDM arm joints reported failures of their brake friction tests.  This was not unexpected based on the past history of SPDM brake friction tests, and a real-time engineering review of the joint motor currents confirmed all joint brakes were meeting their minimum holding requirements; system performance was otherwise nominal.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded today were Mongolia, China, Korea (clouds may have approached from the SW; however, it should have been clear enough for the crew to see Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia left of track as ISS began its pass.  As ISS approached the coast of China, it passed close to nadir, but a little left of track over Beijing.  Looking across the Gulf of Bohai, the crew may have seen Pyongyang, North Korea.  Seoul may have been cloudy, but the crew has already taken some outstanding imagery of that city), and Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh (clouds may have been problematic as ISS began this orbit track, but Kabul may have been visible at the beginning of the pass, to the right of track.  Just to the foothills of the Himalayas and right of track was Islamabad, Pakistan, followed shortly by New Delhi.  Looking left of track after passing over New Delhi, the crew may have been able to see Kathmandu, and further east is Thimphu, Bhutan.  Few clouds are forecasted to be over the Ganges plain.  Close to the Ganges Delta and near nadir or slightly left of track the city of Dhaka should have been visible.)
