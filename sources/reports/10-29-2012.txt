ISS On-Orbit Status 10/29/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Underway: Week 6 of Increment 33 (six-person crew).
 
After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection,</li><li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Completed the periodic (daily) reboot of the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops, and</li><li class="MsoNormalCxSpMiddle" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.</li></ul> 
FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE-4 performed the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Malenchenko, Novitskiy &amp; Tarelkin were joined by Sunita Williams, Kevin Ford &amp; Akihiko Hoshide in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device, set up (and later cleaned up and stowed away) by Malenchenko.        [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures.]
 
Joined by Oleg &amp; Evgeny for knowledge handover, Yuri worked with the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for CO (Carbon Monoxide), Formaldehyde and Ammonia contamination in the SM, recording the measurements.      [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur Dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, Ozone, Acetic Acid, Ammonia, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrous Oxides, Acetone, Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, etc.]
 
FE-4 Malenchenko configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 4<sup>th</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  FE-2 Tarelkin recorded documentary photo/video of the session.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
Afterwards, Evgeny had ~3 hrs for measuring air flow humidity on the SKV 1&amp;2 air conditioner inlets and their outlets in the RS (Russian Segment), specifically focusing on the FGB-PMA (Pressurized Mating Adapter-1) air duct and hatch, MRM1 Rassvet inlet in the FGB GA (Pressurized Adapter) and MRM1-FGB GA hatch. The activity will be continued on 11/1.
 
Sunita Williams completed her 4<sup>th</sup> session with the RFx (Reversible Figures) experiment payload in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), first adjusting the VCA1 (Video Cameras Assembly 1) for coverage, then connecting the RFx hardware to the ESA MPLT (Multipurpose Payload Laptop), followed  by performance of the science protocol in free-floating position. Session data were then copied to PCMCIA memory card. Later, Kevin Ford also undertook the experiment, his first session. The hardware was then stowed.      [RFx is an ESA experiment designed to investigate the adaptive nature of the human neuro-vestibular system in the processing of gravitational information related to 3D visual perception. Previous research suggests that the reliance on linear perspective cues for three dimensional visual perception decreases when subjects are tilted relative to gravity and in microgravity during parabolic and orbital flight. Based on this observation, it is likely that the adaptive changes in the processing of gravitational information by the neuro-vestibular system during spaceflight may alter 3D visual perception. The RFx (Reversible Figures) investigation involves comparisons of pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight perceptions with regards to ambiguous perspective-reversible figures to assess the influence of micro-G.  The question is whether the perception of ambiguous perspective-reversible figures (figures that can normally be seen in 1g to change in perspective or orientation in two different ways) is affected by micro-G.  A comparison of the perceived reversals during visualization of the figures in crewmembers occurs before, during and after long-term exposure to microgravity.  It is expected that measurable, perceptual differences can expand our understanding of human cognitive-perception dynamics by examining the differences that exist between the micro-G environment of the ISS and that of the Earth’s surface.  The hypothesis that the perceived reversal of 2D figures is not affected in micro-G is to be verified by determining for all phases of the spaceflight: (1) the time for first reversal and the number of perceived reversals of 3D and 2D reversible figures in a given time frame; and (2) the probability for seeing each view/reversal within a figure.]
 
Oleg Novitskiy unstowed &amp; set up the Russian BIO-2 BIORISK-KM experiment trays in the ASU/toilet facility area, then took documentary photography with the NIKON D2X with SB 800 flash for subsequent downlink via high-speed RSPI data transmission radio link.
 
Afterwards, Oleg made his way into the SA/Descent Module of the newly arrived Soyuz TMA-06M/32S spacecraft and dismantled its two "Klest" (KL-152) TV cameras and their SG2-14V light units, then turned the equipment over to Yuri for stowing in Soyuz 31S for return to ground.
 
Later, FE-4 worked with FE-1 as handover activity to conduct the periodic replacement of the SRV-K2M’s sediment trap insert (VU) in the SM.  They also replaced the FGS gas/liquid mixture filter/separator (GLMF).    [The VU insert was last replaced on 8/3/12.  The Russian SRVK-2M converts collected condensate into drinking water and dispenses the reclaimed potable water.]
 
Kevin Ford performed regular maintenance on the JAXA MOST (Medaka Osteoclast [killifish]) AQH (Aquatic Habitat) Aquariums 1 &amp; 2 by testing the Aquariums’ water quality using nitrate &amp; nitrite test strips from MELFI-3 Dewar 4 to measure the concentration of ammonium, nitrate and nitrite in the water.  The test strips were then returned to MELFI-3.  
 
Later, Aki Hoshide took over with sample fixation, transferring eight fish from the Fish Carrier to the Fish Fixation Apparatus C for RNAlater KFU (KSC Fixation Tube) fixing.
 
Suni Williams was scheduled for the continuing preventive inspection &amp; cleaning of accessible AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) system bacteria filters in Node-1, Node-2 &amp; Node-3, with pre-cleaning photo documentation.
 
Afterwards, Suni configured the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) for internal EDV-U container use for waste collection, rather than connecting to the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly).     [WHC will remain on internal EDV-U until the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) removal &amp; replacement scheduled on 11/2.]
 
Novitskiy took two photos of the internal part of the MRM2 docking port’s SSVP-StM docking cone to obtain digital imagery of the scratch or scuff mark left by the head of the Soyuz 32S active docking probe on the internal surface of the passive drogue (docking cone) ring, a standard practice after Russian dockings, then downlinking the pictures via RSPI.     [These images are used to refine current understanding of docking conditions.  The objective is to take photo imagery of the scratch or scuff marks left by the head of the docking probe on the internal surface of the drogue (docking cone, ASP) ring, now rotated out of the passageway.  Before shooting the picture, the cosmonaut highlights the scuffmark with a marker and writes the date next to it.  As other crewmembers before him, Oleg used the NIKON D2X digital still camera to take the pictures with the hatch partially closed.]
 
Working on the RSK2 laptop in the RS, Oleg Novitskiy installed software upgrade v.3.1 on the machine, consisting of VIRU (Virtual Instructions Application), SIGMA Application v.8.6.4, and an upgrade for KPT-14 SHADOW-BEACON (Tenj-Mayak) “MAI-75” amateur/ham radio operation via PCMCIA RS-232 adapter.
 
In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Kevin supported POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center)’s remote-commanded downlinking of yesterday’s ELITE-S2 (ELaboratore Immagini TElevisive - Space 2) data by powering on the payload and turning it off again about 3 hrs later.
 
Malenchenko brought the RODF (Russian Operations Data Files) up to date by replacing books or inserting new pages delivered on Soyuz 32S, and prepacking old material for disposal in Progress 48P.
 
Afterwards, Yuri had ~ 2 hrs for collecting microflora samples from surfaces at 12 selected locations in the SM in special sample tubes which he then prepared for return to Earth on Soyuz 31S.
 
FE-4 also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Evgeny Tarelkin handled the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Aki Hoshide closed the protective shutters of the Lab window during external Robotics activity which transferred (“walked” inchworm-wise) the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) by ground commanding from Node-2 to the MBS (Mobile Service System).  This will be followed later by MT (Mobile Transporter) translation (5:15pm-8:15pm), during which RS thrusters will be disabled.
 
After the SSRMS transit, Sunita will open the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment and activated the ISSAC laptop, so ground images can be captured by ground commanding.       [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
Oleg performed his first collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.     [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Kevin completed his (currently) daily task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch on a daily basis and continues on ISS on an SSC/Station Support Computer for every week after his first week in space.
 
Akihiko serviced the WRS (Water Recovery System) by offloading the Lab condensate tank to its neutral point (6 L) to one of the CWCs (Contingency Water Containers), which amounted to about 25 min.
 
Early in the day, Evgeny initiated charging on the TTM-2 battery. Later tonight, FE-2 will terminate it.     [TTM-2 (Thermoanemometer / Thermometer) is part of the Russian KPT-2 payload instrumentation suite.]
 
FE-1 &amp; FE-2 had an hour of free time each for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
At ~5:05am EDT, Yuri, Evgeny &amp; Oleg supported a Russian PAO TV downlink via VHF, extending greetings to the annual international competition for children named “Spacecraft Cadets” which kicks off at GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) on 11/1, held by the Cosmonaut P.R. Popovich Fund, dedicated to the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first group flight of Andriyan Nikolaev and Pavel Popovich.
 
At ~10:00am, CDR, FE-3 &amp; FE-6 debriefed with the ground for ~30 min on the Robotics activities conducted during yesterday’s SpX-1 Dragon unberth/release.
 
At ~10:50am, FE-3 Ford had his weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
At ~12:10pm, Kevin is scheduled for his (currently) daily post-launch PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
At ~2:pm, Williams, Ford &amp; Hoshide will hold the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.    [Deferred from last Saturday, 10/27, when WPC was conducted by just the Russian crewmembers.]
 
Ford familiarized himself with CEVIS cycle ergometer exercise procedures by observing Suni Williams pedaling out on the machine.
 
The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-2, FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).     [CDR &amp; FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed ARED/CEVIS (cont.), with T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), EVA, and T2 (int., 4 min.) for the next 4 days. Aki’s protocol for today showed ARED/CEVIS (cont.), with T2 (int., 4 min.), ARED/CEVIS, EVA and no exercise on the following 4 days.]
