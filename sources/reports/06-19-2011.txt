ISS On-Orbit Status 06/19/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday – Crew off-duty (almost).  ATV2 closeout.  Ahead: Week 14 of Increment 27/28.
 
Crew tasks today focused on closing up ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) “Johannes Kepler” and getting it ready for tomorrow’s undocking (10:48am EDT):
 
FE-3 Garan spent about an hour on the installation of the REBR (Re-Entry Breakup Recorder) in ATV2 and its activation and video documentation.       [Activities included connecting wires, test activation, applying copper tape over wires, transferring REBR-H to the spacecraft and attaching it to the Rack Adapter Plate.  REBR-H is a kind of “black box” for reentry vehicles of 2 kg mass and ~12 inch diameter, containing GPS, temperature sensors, accelerometers, data recorder &amp; an Iridium modem for taking reentry data and “phoning” them “home”, to be activated just before hatch closure.  The first REBR was installed last March in HTV-2 (H2 Transfer Vehicle 2).]
 
Using tools &amp; equipment such as ratchet wrench, air exchange duct bag, flashlight, helmet, dust mask, goggles, gloves, tape, vacuum cleaner, FE-1 Samokutyayev spent ~1h 45m on preparing the ATV for hatch closure.  This included removing smoke detectors, GLA (General Luminaire Assembly) light fixtures, fire extinguisher and other useful equipment from the ATV for recycling.
 
Afterwards, Samokutyayev &amp; Volkov stepped through final preparations for tomorrow’s undocking of “Johannes Kepler” by –
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Removing the quick-release screw clamps which had rigidized the docking joint,
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Taking &amp; downlinking ATV/SM (Service Module) interface photo/video documentation before hatch closure,
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Closing the ATV-SU (outer) and SU-PrK (inner) transfer vestibule hatches (~11:20am EDT), and 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Performing the usual one-hour leak check on both hatches (not later than 57 min after hatch closure). 
 
For his on-going first (FD14) Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment, FE-5 Furukawa observed the initial 10-min rest period (~4:00am EDT) before going about his business, swapping Makita batteries as required.  Midpoint for the entire ICV run will be reached at about 1:15pm, after which the second 24h data collection period is started.         [The rest period involves relaxing &amp; breathing normally for 10 minutes under quiet, restful conditions.  ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres/BP to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist &amp; ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Cady continued the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing were timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After approximately 24 hrs, the Cardiopres was temporarily doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery were changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).  The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.]
 
With its FSS battery freshly charged after wakeup, CDR Borisenko used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 during a one-hour segment, taking pictures of targets along the flight track, including Africa (Lake Tanganyika, Lake Victoria, Lake Rudolf &amp; Ethiopia’s volcano Nabro), Yemen and Saudi Arabia (sand).       [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module.]
 
Afterwards, the CDR used the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, for the monthly standard check on the SM cabin air, testing for Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Formaldehyde.       [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, etc.]
 
Andrey also completed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways to ensure the ventilation/circulation system performs adequately with the six-member station crew.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
FE-6 Fossum transferred HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) and CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) data files from the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for downlink.     [Since MEC files cannot be pulled down directly by the ground after the recent SSCv4 software transition, the crew has to transfer the files to a USB drive and from there to an SSCV server for subsequent downlink.]
 
FE-4 Volkov had another 2.5 hrs set for transferring cargo from Soyuz TMA-02M/27S to the ISS for stowage, recording moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System) database.
 
Andrey Borisenko performed the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness),
 
After configuring STTS communication systems temporarily for crew presence in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, Andrey conducted another active session with the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), supported by ground specialist tagup.  STTS was then reconfigured to nominal.  Andrey later set up the two SONY HVR-Z1J video camcorders for replaying and downlinking their recorded footage over RGS (Russian Groundsite) at 1:12pm-1:36pm and at 2:46pm-3:19pm  EDT.        [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS: condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
Borisenko also performed a ~90 min inventory/audit of 27 Russian CMO medical supply kits in their medlockers. In the SM, checking their contents against an uplinked itemized list.
 
Aleksandr Samokutyayev collected &amp; downloaded the periodic sensor readings of the Russian “Pille-MKS” (MKS = ISS) radiation dosimetry experiment which has 11 sensors placed at various locations in the RS (DC1, SM starboard &amp; port cabin windows, ASU toilet facility, control panel, MRM2, etc.), plus one, the “duty” dosimeter, in the Reader.  Today’s readings were taken manually from all 11 deployed dosimeters and logged on a data sheet.  Automatic mode was then reactivated.      [The dosimeters take their readings automatically every 90 minutes.]
 
Afterwards, Sasha set up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM window #2 for an experiment using the image of the sun (5:00-5:30am) for calibrating the hand-held spectrometer, synchronized with the coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloaded the data to laptop RSE1 for subsequent downlink via OCA, with support by ground specialist tagup.  The equipment was then torn down and stowed away.         [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.]
 
FE-3, FE-4 &amp; FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sergei at ~3:45am, Satoshi at ~4:10am, Ron at ~10:30am EDT.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).
 
No CEO targets uplinked for today.
