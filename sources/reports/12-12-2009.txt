ISS On-Orbit Status 12/12/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – light-duty day for the Exp-22 crew.
 
  FE Suraev started out with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator, installed by him on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).    [Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  CDR Williams continued his current week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), logging data from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  CDR Williams continued his fourth session with the NASA/JSC NUTRITION w/Repository experiment, today performing the usual urine sample collections several times until termination tomorrow after 24 hrs.     [The NUTRITION project is the most comprehensive in-flight study done by NASA to date of human physiologic changes during long-duration space flight.  It includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, nutritional assessments, and hormonal changes, expanding the previous Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) testing in three ways: Addition of in-flight blood &amp; urine collection (made possible by supercold MELFI dewars), normative markers of nutritional assessment, and a return session plus 30-day (R+30) session to allow evaluation of post-flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation.]
 
  The two station residents performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the house cleaning, Suraev conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and also Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  Williams wrapped up the successful OpsLAN (Operations Local Area Network) reload by working on two (of 15) SSCs (Station Support Computers) which needed additional help, then cleaned up.    [The Ops LAN reload is complete and ready for use.  During the reload, SSC-3 failed to register on the network and SSC-5 appeared to have a corrupted load.  Jeff registered the wireless SSC-3 (and any others) that did not join the domain automatically during the reload, and fixed SSC-5 by swapping its hard drive, using a new one (#1087 from laptop # 1108) and when there was still “no joy”, removing an overlooked USB stick (from TOCA).]
 
  With the transition to the new T61c FS (File Server), the T2/COLBERT treadmill and ARED resistive exerciser software needed to be updated accordingly.  Jeff corrected login and time for the T2 and transitioned the ARED display from A31p to the T61c FS. 
 
  The CDR also made the necessary P&amp;I (Pen &amp; Ink) change in the six EMER-1 contingency books from FGB, Lab, Soyuz and Node-2, concerning retrieval of the two new Servers in an emergency, then restowed the books. 
 
  Afterwards, Jeff performed the periodic checks on the MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) and MELFI-2 racks to ascertain whether the nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) pressure of the racks remains within acceptable range.
 
  Maxim Suraev completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Williams conducted the daily status check of the APEX (Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit) hardware, checking for health and color of the plants, since the Cambium plants are removed from the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System), necessitating henceforth a daily status check &amp; weekly photo session).     [When completed, the APEX-Cambium payload in conjunction with the NASA-sponsored TAGES will determine the role of gravity in Cambium wood cell development (providing the pulp &amp; paper and construction industries insight into the fundamental mechanisms of wood cell formation) and demonstrate non-destructive reporter gene technology &amp; investigate spaceflight plant stress.  APEX-Cambium provides NASA &amp; the ISS community a permanent controlled environment capability to support growth of various organisms (i.e. whole plants).]
 
  Working off the Russian discretionary task list, FE Suraev spent free time on –

  At ~8:10am EST, the crew held their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  The station residents also had their weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Maxim at ~5:40am, Jeff at ~12:10pm.
 
  At ~4:14am, the CDR powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at ~4:19am conducted a ham radio session with students at Scuola primaria De Gasperi, Noicattaro, Bari, Italy.    [The school, a public primary school named after Alcide De Gasperi, is attended by about 700 pupils, aged between 6 and 11 years.  In addition to the compulsory activities, the school gives the opportunity to attend optional activities in the afternoon; these concern English language, music, sports, theatre, science, ecology, and other artistic and research activities.  De Gasperi School would like realize the contact with the ISS in occasion of the celebrations of the centenarian of the Nobel Prize to Guglielmo Marconi.  The contact site is located at “Cittadella Mediterranea della Scienza” of Bari, promoted by University of Bari.  The “Cittadella Mediterranea della Scienza” is a permanent structure whose main aim is to diffuse scientific culture and its related technologies.]
 
  Jeff &amp; Max performed their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE).
 
  Later, the CDR transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
