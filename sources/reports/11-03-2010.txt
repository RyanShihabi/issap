ISS On-Orbit Status 11/03/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
 
 At wake-up, FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 CDR Wheelock, FE-6 Walker &amp; FE-3 Kelly continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 7<sup>th</sup> for Wheels &amp; Shannon, 2<sup>nd</sup> for Scott, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Later, Doug prepared his SLEEP Actiwatch by replacing its lithium battery, downloading its data to the COL HRF PC-1 (Portable Computer 1) and initializing it, then decabling &amp; stowing the hardware and powering off the PC.
 
 After wake-up, Doug, Shannon &amp; Scott performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift (therefore, for the next sleep shift sequence RST is scheduled twice daily from 11/1 through 5 days after the STS-133 crew lands). The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Also at day’s begin, FE-5 Yurchikhin terminated his 10<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 After his session with the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (“Study of<a name="_Toc416143806"></a><a name="_Toc416143862"></a><a name="_Toc416144063"></a> the Veins in the Lower Extremities”) on Monday (11/1) using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex, FE-1 Kaleri today unstowed the HOLTER ECG (Electrocardiogram) device to conduct a stand-alone test on it via its display, after temporarily installing a battery (AA).
 
 Starting a new round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, Alex also changed out the cartridges of the four dust filters (PF1-4) in the SM (Service Module), discarding the used cartridges.
 
 Later, Kaleri went to work on the newly installed Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), assembling the payload equipment and initiating operation, while Skripochka took documentary NIKON D2X/flash photography of Sasha with the electromagnetic unit and the replaceable container.  The hardware was then disassembled and stowed, and the video/camcorder footage downlinked.     [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS: condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
 Following up on yesterday’s troubleshooting of the failed SPS Analog/Digital Converter of the Soyuz 24S Descent Module’s “Neptune” console (PKSA), Sasha today reviewed the InPU Integrated Control Panel’s data log files for more testing.      [Preliminary results from the Russian specialists have indicated that the problem is hardware related, preventing the SPS from receiving power.]
 
 The CDR started another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [This was the 38<sup>th</sup> session with the GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 100 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],
 
 In support of the NASA EPO (Education Payload Operations) program, Wheelock first reviewed the scheduled educational session procedures, then set up the video camcorder and teamed with Shannon Walker in discussing the importance of physical exercise and demonstrating some of the onboard exercise equipment.  A 2<sup>nd</sup> planned EPO demo, on favorite hobbies on ISS, was deferred to later.      [The demo was timed such that EPO ground personnel could watch, for providing real-time feedback during the demo.  The high-definition G1 camcorder tape was played back via the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter). ]
 
 In the US A/L (Airlock), Shannon Walker worked on EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units) #3005 &amp; #3009, setting them up with their SCUs (Service &amp; Cooling Umbilicals) and initiating the standard one-hour scrubbing process on the spacesuits’ and Airlock’s cooling water loops, filtering ionic and particulate matter (via a 3-micron filter), then reconfiguring the cooling loops and starting the ~2hr biocide (iodination) filtering.  Today’s activities also included EMU harness (biomed connector) inspection with downlinked photographs.      [Loop scrubbing, incl. iodination of the LCVGs (Liquid Cooling &amp; Ventilation Garments) for biocidal maintenance is done to eliminate any biomass and particulate matter that may have accumulated in the loops.]
 
 Sasha Kaleri did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Oleg Skripochka completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance by updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 FE-2 also conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, DC1–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 Afterwards, Skripochka prepared Node-2 for STS-133/ULF5 docking by cleaning out cargo from its forward hatch area and moving it to Progress 39P. 
 
 As next steps in the Russian EVA-26 preparation timeline towards the spacewalk training run on 11/12, Skripochka &amp; Yurchikhin today spent several hours on gathering replaceable Orlan-MK spacesuit elements &amp; equipment (SMEG), servicing the suits and readying personal gear, supported by ground specialist tagup.     [Fyodor will wear Orlan #5 (red stripes) with BRTA (telemetry unit) #7, Oleg Orlan #4 (blue stripes) with BRTA #6.  Orlan replaceable components &amp; auxiliary equipment include such items as LP-9 LiOH canisters, primary &amp; reserve BK-3M O<sub>2</sub> tanks, measurement unit filters, moisture collectors, FOR feedwater filters, BOS degassing pump unit filter, Valsalva nose devices, 825M3 batteries, etc.]
 
 Afterwards, Oleg &amp; Fyodor worked on preparing the DC1 Docking Compartment and SM PkhO (Transfer Compartment) for the EVA dry-run &amp; EVA-26 by moving out science payloads and transferring them to the MRM2 “Poisk” module for temporary stowage (i.e., no IMS update).
 
 FE-6 Walker had ~1h for more cargo prepacking &amp; staging for ULF5.
 
 Shannon also –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Spent time on unpacking &amp; stowing US items unloaded from Progress 40P,</li><li>Configured the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) for using the internal EDV-U container, and reported the flush counter,</li><li>Performed the periodic inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks). </li></ul> 
 FE-3 Kelly had ~1hr for taking more special photographic shots with the D2X digital cameras for starting Photosynth mapping in the FGB, Lab, Node-1, Node-2, Node-3, Airlock, Columbus, Kibo JPM and JLP, with no crewmembers in sight.      [Photosynth is a Microsoft-developed process to turn series of photos into 3-D panoramic vistas.  Photosynth allows everyone (except Mac users) to create unique panoramas or "synths" using their own photos.  Photosynth was already used by NASA last year for RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) photography of the Orbiter underside.  It is being used to create a 3-D rendering of the ISS's interior for training purposes, so astronauts familiarize themselves with their new home before they get there.]
 
 Afterwards, Scott Kelly –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Performed the periodic snubber arm inspection on the T2/COLBERT treadmill, checking the joints of the arm stacks to track the structural integrity of the hardware following  exercise sessions,</li><li>Serviced the VCAM (Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor) by opening both He (helium) valves, then closing the access door again and re-attaching the acoustic blanket,</li><li>Inspected fasteners on the GLA BBA (General Luminaire Assembly / Baseplate Ballast Assembly) in Node-2 (loc. D2), tightening (torquing) loose fasteners as required  [downlink photos had shown that two of twelve BBA fasteners were not fully engaged],</li><li>Checked the running SPHINX (SPaceflight of Huvec: an Integrated eXperiment) payload in COL and reported on KUBIK-6 incubator status &amp; temperature  [SPHINX, in the EDR (European Drawer Rack, studies how HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) modify their behavior in microgravity which could provide better knowledge of endothelial function and be useful for clinical applications], and</li><li>Worked several hours checking &amp; cleaning IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) fan inlets in Node-1 (aft port) &amp; Node-3 (starboard overhead) after temporarily removing the Velcro cover from the PMA-1 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 1) grille, and installing a duct filter in the IMV cone screen assembly at the PMA-1/Node-1 bulkhead.</li></ul> 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin completed his first orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test session with the Russian Chibis suit, conducting the MedOps MO-4 exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill, assisted by FE-1 Kaleri as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Fyodor was supported in his one-hour session by ground specialist tagup via VHF at 12:37pm EDT.     [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of Yurchikhin’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.] 
 
 Before sleeptime, Fyodor also set up and readied the PZE MO-9 equipment for another Russian “Urolux” biochemical urine testing, scheduled tomorrow for all three Russian crewmembers.    [MO-9 is conducted regularly every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for US crewmembers for IMG (Integrated Medical Group) PHS evaluation as part of the "PFE w/o Blood Labs" exam.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally for the Mir program.  The data are then entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software.]
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Vientiane, Laos (ISS had a near-nadir pass for this target in clear weather and mid-afternoon light with approach from the southwest.  This capital city of about a quarter of a million is located on a large, south-turning bend in the Mekong River forming the Laotian-Thai border.  Trying contextual views that include the entire urban area), Dakar, Senegal (the capital city of Senegal has a population estimated at just over 1 million and dominates the promontory known as Cape Verde, Africa’s westernmost point.  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass in fair weather near for this target with approach from the southwest.  On this nadir pass, trying for a complete mapping of the urban area of the city), and Nassau, Bahamas (ISS had a near-nadir pass at mid-afternoon in fair weather.  As it tracked over the much larger Andros Island, the crew was to look for the nearby island of New Providence and the city of Nassau.  It is the capital and largest city in the Bahamas.  With a population of 260,000 [2008], Nassau contains nearly 80% of the entire population of the Bahamas.  A CEO image of this city will help researchers to fill in the capitals of the world in their database).
