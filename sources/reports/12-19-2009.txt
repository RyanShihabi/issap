ISS On-Orbit Status 12/19/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – light-duty day for the Exp-22 crew
 
  Flight Engineer Suraev began the day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by him on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  Commander Williams completed another Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  A total of 121 RST runs are assigned to Jeff for the duration of his orbital stay.]
 
  The two station residents performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the house cleaning, Suraev conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and also Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  In the JAXA Kibo module, Williams supported the ongoing troubleshooting of the SLT2 (System Laptop Terminal 2) computer (after a first round on 7/1), by performing the second &amp; third (of 5) file system check.     [On 6/30, the SLT2 experienced a communications loss with the JCP (JEM Control Processor) and has not activated properly since then.  SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center)’s troubleshooting is being performed with a stand-alone SLT2 and consists essentially of checking/verifying correct activation of four different Operating Systems on the laptop (SLT, MKAM, BDAS &amp; Windows XP.]
 
  The CDR completed the daily status check of the APEX-Cambium hardware, looking for health and color of the plants.  Because the Cambium plants were removed from the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) and thus ground-based monitoring, a daily status check &amp; weekly photo session are necessary.     [When completed, the APEX-Cambium payload in conjunction with the NASA-sponsored TAGES (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System) will determine the role of gravity in Cambium wood cell development (providing the pulp &amp; paper and construction industries insight into the fundamental mechanisms of wood cell formation) and demonstrate non-destructive reporter gene technology &amp; investigate spaceflight plant stress.  APEX-Cambium provides NASA &amp; the ISS community a permanent controlled environment capability to support growth of various organisms (i.e. whole plants).]
 
  Williams also performed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and File Server SSC laptops, followed 10 min later by rebooting the two T61p OpsLAN Servers (one prime, one backup).
 
  Maxim did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
  Jeff filled out another weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  At ~9:20am EST, the crew held their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  Jeff &amp; Maxim performed their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR).
 
  The CDR later transferred the exercise data files to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  Working off the Russian discretionary task list, FE Suraev spent his free time on –

 2A Modal Analysis Update:    During yesterday’s DTF (Dedicated Thruster Firing) test using the SM (Service Module) thrusters, dynamic data were taken with IWIS/EWIS (Internal Wireless Instrumentation System / External Wireless Instrumentation System), SAMS/MAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System / Microgravity Acceleration Measurement System), and SDMS (Structural Dynamic Measurement System).  Photogrammetry was not performed as originally planned since the longeron shadowing analysis was not complete.  Photos were taken after the DTF.   Background: As a result of the 2A BGA (Beta Gimbal Assembly) failing to unlatch during 19S undocking, the 2A photovoltaic array experienced several cycles of longeron shadowing that may have exceeded the buckling limits.  The DTF was performed in order to check on this by characterizing the state of the P4-2A array structure.]
