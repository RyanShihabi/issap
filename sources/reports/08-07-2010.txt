ISS On-Orbit Status 08/07/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – EVA-15 day.
 
 US EVA-15 by EV1 Doug Wheelock &amp; EV2 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson was terminated without Loop A PM (Pump Module) removal because of a leak at one (M3) of the four QDs (Quick Disconnects) connecting the ammonia lines to the failed PM of the starboard EATCS (External Active Thermal Control System) during demate activities.  Torque on the 4 PM bolts remains unbroken.     [After Wheelock reconnected the M3 QD on the PM to stop the leak, not enough suit time remained to allow further PM work, due to the time necessary for the crew’s cleanup procedures for assuring than no ammonia was introduced into the pressurized volume of the ISS.  EV1 &amp; EV2 began their “campout” last night in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe.  Following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Caldwell-Dyson &amp; Wheelock at 2:35am-3:45am, the A/L hatch was closed again by Shannon Walker &amp; Fyodor Yurchikhin for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge (~5:15am-5:30am) and prebreathe in the EMUs (~5:30am-6:20am).  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-15 began at 7:19am EDT.  It ended at 3:22pm, lasting 8h 3 min – the longest ISS-EVA and the sixth-longest EVA in history.  It was the 148<sup>th</sup> spacewalk for ISS assembly &amp; maintenance, and the 240<sup>th</sup> for US astronauts, with a total time of 929 hrs 38 min.]
  
  Before the EVA, FE-6 Walker –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Printed out instructions      for actions to be taken in case of occurrence of a “next worst      failure”, e.g. MBSU 2 (Main Bus Switching      Unit 2) failure, ETCS Loop B failure, File Server crash, etc., </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Completed the IV      (Intravehicular) portion of the EVA “inhibit pad”, i.e., the      list of temporary external deactivations in support of the EVA,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Set up the RWS (Robotic      Workstation) and DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) peripherals      with the IPV (International Procedures Viewer) laptop to support SSRMS      (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) ops, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Operated the SSRMS,      “flying” Douglas Wheelock during the EVA.</li> </ul> 
  During the spacewalk, CDR Skvortsov assisted Walker on the SSRMS, and FE-5 Yurchikhin worked with her supporting the Campout, prebreathe, EVA prep &amp; post-EVA activities.
  
  At wake-up, Fyodor Yurchikhin performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspected the filters before bedtime this morning, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  Alex Skvortsov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  FE-2 &amp; FE-4 had their standard post-EVA PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Wheels at ~3:50pm, Tracy at ~3:25pm EDT.
 
  Before their sleeptime, Caldwell-Dyson, Wheelock &amp; Walker were to complete another run of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, today only once.     [The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  The Russian crewmembers worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-3, FE-5), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).
