ISS On-Orbit Status 02/13/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – a busy “day” for the combined crews. Sleep shift in effect:  The ISS crew’s workday began last evening at 4:14pm and ended this morning at 7:44 EST (see time table at bottom).
 
  At wake-up last evening, FE-1 Suraev did the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-1 again inspected the filters this morning before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  CDR Williams &amp; FE-6 Creamer continued their new week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s second, donning their Actiwatches, from which to log data to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Working in the SM (Service Module), after switching the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> removal system to Automatic mode, Kotov &amp; Suraev finished the installation of a new BRI Smart Switch Router computer and ASP Network Connection Adapter, started 2/11, laying new cables from the BRI to the old BRI location behind the medical locker and from the new BRI to the RSS1 and RSS2 laptops, plus from the ASP to future payload Ethernet connections behind panel 225.  Later, Oleg switched Vozdukh back to Manual mode. 
 
  Maxim again downloaded TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) structural dynamics measurements of the 20A docking and re-set the hardware for more data taking, later checking its status.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
  CDR Williams replaced a failed LHA (Lamp Housing Assembly) in the starboard CQ (Crew Quarters), stowing the old unit in a CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory).
 
  Afterwards, Jeff filled the WRS WSTA (Water Recovery System / Waste Storage Tank Assembly) to start UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) processing.  The filling was later repeated by FE-6 Creamer. 
 [During the first processing run, the WPA MLS (Water Processor Assembly / Mostly Liquid Separator) inlet pressure dropped from ~50 mmHg (gauge) to 8 mmHg (gauge), indicative of a clogged EFA filter or solenoid valve.  Processing completed despite the low pressures, as did a second processing run.  The current plan is to continue processing in the degraded mode, with the priority given to processing of urine distillate.  It is expected that starting the WPA processing cycle at a higher tank quantity will allow the MLS to fill and cycle, which causes a "reverse flush" of the WWT (Waste Water Tank) solenoid valve. This should provide sufficient data to isolate the observed pressure drop to either the solenoid valve or the recently-installed EFA filter assembly.  If the problem is confirmed to be the EFA, the team will pursue the plan to flush the WWT and replace the EFA.]
 
  After completing the fine leak check of Node-3 “Tranquility” last night, Williams &amp; MS2 Steve Robinson opened the Node-3 hatch (~9:18pm EST) and began the lengthy job of outfitting the Node-3 vestibule, first moving equipment from Node-1 to the vestibule to gain ingress into “Tranquility” (docked to Node-1), then taking air sample readings in Node-3 with the GRC (Grab Sample Container) and CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products).
 
  Jeff &amp; Steve then mounted caps on the Node-3 aft &amp; nadir PPRVs (Positive Pressure Relief Valves), and installed data, fluid and IMV (Intermodular Ventilation) jumpers in the Node-1-to-Node-3 vestibule.
 
  Next step was for Jeff to configure Node-3 rack bays to accept their racks, followed by the transfer of the ARS (Atmosphere Revitalization Systems) Rack from Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module, loc. F3) by Soichi Noguchi, assisted by PLT Terry Virts, to Node-3 (loc. A4).  Soichi also removed the temporary IMV duct from Node-2 and installed it in Node-3.    [These tasks took longer than expected, and Jeff was allowed to waive his exercise sessions today.]
 
  TJ Creamer took airflow measurements with the Velocicalc instrument at the Node-3’s temporary air duct to verify sufficient airflow, then conducted an inspection of the aft NPRVs (Negative Pressure Relief Valves) for actuation during launch.    [Node-3 Stbd NPRVs will be inspected during IMV valve Installation.]
 
  Afterwards, TJ conducted purges and leak checks on the Node-3 O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) systems.
 
  Creamer then installed HYZOD window covers and protective shields in Node-3.    [This included the outer cover assembly on the Stbd window plus inner covers on the Node-3 Zenith &amp; Stbd windows, also covers on the EVA hatch and IVA hatch windows, as well as protective shields on Node-3 Nadir, Fwd, Aft &amp; Port.]
 
  After collecting plant samples (wheat) of the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment for return to the ground, Max Suraev transferred new Rasteniya-2 hardware from Progress 36P and installed it in the SM, setting up the root module, plants kit, leaf chamber, light unit and KDV water container, then filling two water tank, loading new software and running a hardware test, then starting the experiment.    [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the Lada-15 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).  During its operation, the experiment requires regular daily maintenance of the experiment involving monitoring of seedling growth, humidity measurements, moistening of the substrate if necessary, and photo/video recording.]
 
  Working with FE-4 Kotov, Noguchi transferred the ARED Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) to the Node-3.
 
  After stowing the ARED advanced resistive exercise device overnight in Node-3 and re-installing the
  VIS (Vibration Isolation Stabilization) in Node-3, Suraev &amp; Noguchi today installed the ARED in “Tranquility”, including all cables, and taking documentary photography.    [Upon completion of ARED installation, the ground will review the photos and provide a Go/No Go for the unmanned ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout), scheduled with the Manned ACOs on FD9 (2/16).]
 
  Maxim started charging the Sony SM-HDV-U03 battery for tomorrow’s session of the Russian payload TkhN-7 SVS (Self-Propagating High-Temperature Synthesis).    [SVS uses its own camera, “Telescience” hardware from PK-3 (Plasma Crystallization) and the onboard Klest TV system for researching self-propagating high-temperature fusion of samples in space.]
 
  Terry &amp; Kay operated the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) to release Node-3 and grapple the Lab, followed by a base change from Node-2 to the Lab.   Virts &amp; Hire then released Node-2 and maneuvered the Canadian arm to the overnight park position.    [The SSRMS remained there overnight and then supported the Cupola and Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint (TRRJ) photogrammetry activity scheduled to begin later this morning.]
 
  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).
 
  At ~4:09am-5:09am EST this morning, the joint crew held an in-depth one-hour review of procedures for the EVA-2 spacewalk, with egress scheduled tonight at ~9:14pm EST.
 
  At ~6:39am, Behnken (EV1) &amp; Patrick (EV2) began their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) in the A/L with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe (~6:39am-7:44am) and sleep from 8:14am-4:14pm tonight.  A hygiene break is scheduled for 4:54pm-6:04pm.  EVA-2 objectives: Node-3 outfitting (hooking up ammonia lines), support grappling Cupola.    [Sleep for the ISS crew began at 7:44am.]
 
 Cupola Issue:   The crew could not install the Node-3 Axial Port Center Disk Cover due to physical interference with Cupola structure such as a Cupola standoff bar.  Teams are investigating center disk options such as removal of Cupola structure, alternate installation of cover, etc., and Cupola relocation options such as EVA removal of Node-3 nadir cover, delay of Cupola relocation, etc.  Cupola grapple and relocate are expected to happen on schedule.
 
 Orbiter TPS:  The Shuttle Thermal Protection System has been cleared for entry.
