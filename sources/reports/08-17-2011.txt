ISS On-Orbit Status 08/17/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel.
 
At wake-up, FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Furukawa &amp; FE-6 Fossum completed another post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev conducted his 2<sup>nd</sup> onboard session of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (“Study of<a name="_Toc416144063"></a><a name="_Toc416143806"></a><a name="_Toc416143862"></a> the Veins in the Lower Extremities”), using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex with orthogonal leads.      [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Aleksandr set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump &amp; valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a “body box”) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).]
 
Afterwards, Andrey Borisenko also completed a session of the MedOps MO-12 assessment, his 2<sup>nd</sup>.
 
The CDR continued the audit/inventory of stowage in the SM and FGB, Part 3, working his way through an uplinked stowage list comprising a total of 938 Russian equipment items.
 
The 27S crewmembers Volkov, Furukawa &amp; Fossum joined up in their Soyuz TMA-02M spacecraft (docked at the MRM1 Rassvet module) for the standard 3-hr Soyuz/ISS Emergency Descent Drill, a regular procedure for each station crew.  The exercise, which does not involve any command activation, uses computer simulation (Trenasher Spusk/”descent trainer”) on the RSK1 T61p laptop, with a descent hand controller (RUS) in manual mode to set up reentry conditions and switch between modes.  Operators were Sergei &amp; Satoshi.  The two RSK1 laptops were later swapped again.     [The onboard training (OBT) session, supported by TsUP instructor tagup, included a review of the pertinent RODF (Russian Operations Data Files), specifically the books on Soyuz Insertion &amp; Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situation Procedures such as manual undocking.]
 
In preparation for Progress M-12M/44P docking at SM aft nadir on 8/26 (Friday next week), Samokutyayev &amp; Volkov conducted the standard 40-min. vehicle-to-vehicle TORU test between the SM and the DC1 nadir-docked Progress M-10M/42P (#410), closely monitored by ground personnel on DO16 via VHF.  Progress thrusters (DPO) were inhibited and not involved.     [The TORU teleoperator system lets an SM-based crewmember perform the approach &amp; docking of automated Progress vehicles manually in case of failure of the KURS radio-based autopilot.]
 
Satoshi Furukawa conducted the T+5 day visual microbial (bacterial &amp; fungal) analysis &amp; data recording of remaining surface &amp; air samples collected by him on 8/12 at selected sites in the Lab, Node-1, Node-2, Node-3, FGB, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) with the Microbiology SSK (Surface Sampling Kit) and MAS (Microbial Air Sampler).      [The colony growth on the sampling slides is inspected visually after five days of incubation, using a special procedure to analyze the SSK media slides for bacterial &amp; fungal colony growths.  All samples will be returned regardless of growth.]
 
Satoshi also started another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.      [Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
Meanwhile, Fossum completed the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their Lab ERs (EXPRESS Racks).
 
Afterwards, Mike had ~2 hrs set aside to get started on a lengthy IFM (In Flight Maintenance) on the US IVA (Intravehicular Activity) toolbox, reconfiguring it by backfilling its empty slots with unpacked replacement tools flown on ULF-7, and moving selected tools from Tool Page Case (used on ULF-7) back to the toolbox.
 
FE-4 Volkov terminated the charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery, initiated last night.
 
Sergei also worked on the inactive Russian Elektron oxygen generator, installing a new EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference) filter (FPP) on the Elektron’s ST-64 current stabilizer.     [The electronic filter is designed to protect visiting vehicles, such as the HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle), from RF/EMI.]
 
Borisenko performed maintenance on the newly activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, today switching pumps in root module KM A24 by exchanging the outlet lines of Pump 1 &amp; Pump 2 and reconnecting them.      [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] 
 
Sergei afterwards replaced a broken cable from the communications panel in the FGB’s PGO section to the RTT switch (BT).  The damaged cable was trashed in Progress 43P.
 
Sasha completed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, DC1–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
In the FGB, FE-1 continued the current round of the periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, cleaning the detachable VT7 fan screens of the three SOTR gas-liquid heat exchangers (GZhT4), plus the fixed GZhT4 grill with vacuum cleaner and soft brush, then replacing the PS1 &amp; PS2 dust collector filters with new spares.
 
Borisenko &amp; Samokutyayev each performed another data collection session for the psychological program MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”), accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Andrey’s 8<sup>th</sup>, Sasha’s 9<sup>th</sup> onboard session with MBI-16.      [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Ron Garan successfully reinstalled the MCA DCA (Major Constituents Analyzer / Data &amp; Control Assembly, ORU1) in Node-3 and later supported its ground-commanded activation.  It is currently in its standard 72-h hold to allow MCA to stabilize before a full calibration is performed.      [In May, this ORU 1 was installed into the LAB MCA.  The Node-3 MCA ORU2 is nearing its end of life and will be operated in LEM (Life Extending Mode).  It will be used on an “as needed” basis for operations that change the ISS atmosphere such as O<sub>2</sub> represses.  Note: the LAB MCA is non-operational due to a failure of its ORUs assembly.] 
 
Later, Ron had another 2h 45m reserved for more unpacking &amp; ISS-stowing of US cargo delivered on Progress M-10M/42P, docked at DC-1.
 
After configuring the Lab video camcorder for live monitoring of his activities on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), Garan set up another experiment run on the FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility), ground-assisted by POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center).     Steps included opening the upper rack doors removing a CIR Manifold Bottle (#2011) with 40% O<sub>2</sub>, 20% CO<sub>2 </sub>&amp; 40% N<sub>2</sub>, and remaining pressure of 1387 psia on one of the four manifolds in front of the Optics Bench, and replacing it with a fresh one (#2015), also containing 40% O<sub>2</sub>, 20% CO<sub>2 </sub>&amp; 40% N<sub>2</sub>.  Ron then closed the upper rack doors, turned on two switches and informed POIC that the rack was ready for remote commanding.] 
 
Shortly before sleeptime, Satoshi began his first experiment with the onboard DK (Diagnostic Kit), to continue for 3 straight days with a series of medical diagnostic measurements including cardio/heart, brainwave, and oxygen measurements.     [Starting tonight with the first (of 3) oxygen level measurement with the Pulse Oximeter, Satoshi will record brainwaves overnight during sleep, followed tomorrow by Cardiograph measurements &amp; Heart Sound recordings through Friday (8/19).  These measurements will then be repeated two more times later during the Increment.  Purpose of these activities is to perform diagnostic measurements with medical equipment in order to evaluate the equipment for development of a future diagnostic system on board.  DK includes: Medical laptop, USB Camera, Pulse Oximeter, Stethoscope, Sleep Monitor and Digital Walk Holter/Electrocardiograph and Electroencephalograph (for brain waves).]
 
Sergei conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Working from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, FE-4 also took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Andrey, Sasha &amp; Sergei joined up for an hour of filming a video session for Roskosmos TV Studio with the high-resolution Sony HVR-Z7E camcorder, to be used in a joint project with Karouselj (Merry Go-round) TV Channel for children ages 8 to 12 years, the “It’s Time to go to Space!” program, which has a segment where cosmonauts are discussing their work &amp;, answer viewers’ questions.  The footage was then downlinked to TsUP-Moscow.      [A special issue of the project will be dedicated to the world-wide Knowledge Day, on September 1.]
 
Afterwards, the three Russian crewmembers used another hour of filming another installment of the “The Orbital Station. Life on Orbit” video, intended for a documentary film to be prepared by the Roskosmos TV studio for the “Kultura” State TV channel.     [Film authors are asking Russian ISS crew members to take video according to the uplinked scenario and to give an interview during a comm pass scheduled later.]
 
FE-3, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Ron at ~10:00am, Satoshi at ~11:40am, Mike at ~1:15pm EDT.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Goat Paddock Impact Crater, W. Australia (Goat Paddock is only 5.1-km in diameter, and less than 50 million years old.  This is a small, hard-to-find young impact site located in NW Australia near the confluence of Margaret R. and a tributary.  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass in clear weather for this target.  Since the impact was right of track and light was a bit low for the long lens, the CEO staff requested overlapping images for context of the impact area), Lilongwe, Malawi (Lilongwe was at nadir for today’s pass approaching from the SW with clear weather expected.  This capital city of nearly 1 million is located in a plateau region southwest of Lake Malawi.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban area and surroundings were requested), Kwanza Basin (ISS had a mid-afternoon pass in fair weather for this target.  As it approached the African coast from the SW, the crew was to look just left of track.  General views were requested to document a thin string of new developments [infrastructure such as main roads, power lines, and settlements along the roads] between the capital city, Luanda, and new oilfields inland.  Critical features will be acquired with overlapping images.  The rationale behind imaging this site is to document planned and unplanned changes in the Luanda-oilfields corridor developing between the coastal capital city, Luanda, and the new oilfields to the NE.  Few usable images have yet been acquired, mainly due to the presence of continuous equatorial cloud), and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (HMS Beagle Site:  Darwin and the Beagle arrived in the vicinity of Rio de Janeiro, presently a city of more than 7 million, in April of 1832, and undertook an expedition inland.  ISS had a nadir pass today in mid-afternoon light with fair weather expected.  At this time as the crew tracked northeastward along the Brazilian coast, they were to map the urban area around the prime visual cue, Guanabara Bay).
