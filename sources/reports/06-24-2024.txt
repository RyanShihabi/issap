USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #90 Radio Frequency Group (RFG) Retrieval Part 2.5:Today’s RFG Retrieval 2.5 EVA was terminated shortly following Airlock Hatch opening and prior to crew egress due to an Airlock SCU water leak. The Airlock was safely repressed and the EV crew doffed their suits. The Expedition 71 EVA series is being reevaluated by the ground team.

Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) Pressure Control & Pump Assembly (PCPA) Motor Swap Preparation: The crew completed a PCPA Motor Remove & Replace (R&R) Big Picture Words Review, an activity to gather items for the PCPA Motor R&R, and a PCPA Motor R&R Crew Conference. This week, in order to ensure a functional PCPA spare exists on-board the ISS, the crew will perform a maintenance procedure to R&R a PCPA Motor. The crew will remove the motors from PCPA SN002 and PCPA SN007, then install the motor from PCPA SN007 into the housing of PCPA SN002. Another spare PCPA is also planned to arrive in August on the Cygnus NG-21 vehicle.
Environmental Health System (EHS) – Surface Sampler Kit (SSK) and Microbial Air Sampler (MAS) Analysis: Today, the crew visually analyzed media slides and Petri dishes after incubation and sorted for return. These samples will give medical personnel a gauge of microbial growth in the air and on surfaces of ISS. The EHS monitors the atmosphere for gaseous contaminants from nonmetallic materials off-gassing, combustion products, propellants, microbial contaminants from crewmembers and ISS activities, water quality, acoustics, and radiation levels.
