Orbital-2 (Orb-2) Ingress:  Following yesterday’s successful capture and berthing of Cygnus, the crew completed vestibule outfitting, ingressed the vehicle, and began transferring cargo to ISS.
Robonaut Operations: Commander (CDR) Swanson removed the Robonaut panels and battery backpack to gain access to the Robonaut processor and board. Tomorrow, Swanson will continue Robonaut operations. The Robonaut upgrades are in preparation to install legs onto Robonaut for mobility operations.
NanoRacks Operations: FE-6 Gerst activated two of three NanoRacks Module-9 Extended delivered on Orb-2. He mixed the mixture tubes within the modules and installed five more NanoRacks Modules into NanoRacks Platform 2 1. These modules carry a variety of science investigations including, but not limited to ant colony behavior, E-Coli antibiotic resistance, plant growth, radiation measurements, Penicillin growth, and battery life. The investigations have been put together by middle school and high school students.
Force Shoes: Gerst conducted an Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) exercise session using the Force Shoes which were calibrated during Treadmill 2 (T2) exercise last week. The data from the ARED exercise session will be used to measure the loads experienced during ARED exercise.
Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) Low Temperature Loop (LTL) Pump Package Remove & Replace (R&R): On January 14, 2014, the JEM LTL pump upstream Remote Power Controller (RPC) tripped due to over current detection downstream of the RPC. Troubleshooting was performed, resulting in a recommendation to R&R the pump. Today Gerst disengaged cabin ducts from the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS)/Thermal Control System (TCS)1 rack and rotated the rack. This activity is in preparation for tomorrow’s planned R&R using a spare pump delivered on Orb-2.
