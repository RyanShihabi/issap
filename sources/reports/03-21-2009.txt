ISS On-Orbit Status 03/21/09
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday.  Flight Day 7 (FD7) of STS-119/15A --- EVA-2 Day &amp; plenty of work for all 10 station residents.   ISS crew work cycle today: Wake 7:45am EDT; sleep 10:45pm (until 7:15am tomorrow morning).
 
 Mission 15A EVA-2 is underway.   Begun at 12:51pm EDT (6 min behind schedule), the spacewalk is being performed by MS2 Steve Swanson (EV1) &amp; MS3 Joseph Acaba (EV-2).    [EV1 &amp; EV2 began their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) last night at ~10:10pm in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the  Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe at ~10:10pm-11:15pm.  This morning, following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Swanson &amp; Acaba at ~8:20am-9:30am after spending the night on 10.2 psi, the A/L hatch was closed again by Fincke &amp; Wakata for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge (~11:00am) and prebreathe (~11:15am) in the EMUs.  Afterwards, with CL depressurization (~12:15pm) and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-1 began at 12:51pm EDT.  The excursion is expected to last about 6h 30m, i.e., nominally until ~7:21pm, viewed by the SSRMS (Space Station  Remote Maneuvering System) videocams, operated by M1 John Phillips &amp; FE-2 Sandra Magnus.]
 
 EVA-2 Objectives:
 <ul><li>Prepare six P6 Batteries, install gap spanner, break torque/retorque two bolts (H1 &amp; H2) on each battery with ratchet wrench;  <li>Deploy P3 Nadir UCCAS (Unpressurized Cargo Carriers Attachment System);  <li>Install JLP (JEM Pressurized Logistics Segment) GPS Antenna B for JAXA;  <li>Perform infrared photo/video imagery on S1/P1 Thermal Radiators;  <li>Swap two connectors on CMG Patch Panel on Z1 truss;  <li>Deploy S3 Outboard/Zenith PAS (Payload Attach System); and  <li>Cleanup &amp; Ingress. 
 </li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>Before the spacewalk, CDR Fincke powered down the amateur/ham radio equipment to prevent RF interference, while FE-2-18 Wakata closed the shutters of the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) science window to protect against thruster firing effluents during the maneuver to Shuttle waste &amp; CWC (Contingency Water Container) water dumping (~11:20am).   [Besides waste water, excess water is produced by the Shuttle in its power-generating fuel cells.]
 
 After the spacewalkers’ return on board tonight, post-EVA activities by Antonelli, Fincke &amp; Wakata in the “Quest” A/L will consist of –
 <ul><li>Recharging the EMU/spacesuits with water from PWR (Payload Water Reservoir),  <li>Reconnecting the LTAs (Lower Torso Assemblies) to the EMUs,  <li>Initiating battery charging in the A/L BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly),  <li>Installing two of the expended Campout &amp; spacesuit METOX (Metal Oxide) CO2 removal canisters in the “bake-out” oven for regeneration, and  <li>Taking photographs of the EMU gloves for subsequent downlink and inspection. 
 </li></li></li></li></li></ul> Before breakfast, FE-2 Magnus began her second Increment session with the biomed experiment INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function), collecting one wet saliva sample.    [IMMUNE protocol requires the collection to occur first thing post-sleep, before eating, drinking and brushing teeth, and all samples are stored at ambient temperature.  Along with NUTRITION (Nutritional Status Assessment),  INTEGRATED IMMUNE  samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmember soak a piece of cotton inside their mouth and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.] 
 
 For the Russian BTKh-11 BIODEGRADATSIYA ("Biodegradation”) experiment, FE-1 Lonchakov collected surface samples from specific equipment and structures in the SM (Service Module) behind panels 139 &amp; 407 for subsequent stowage in the Soyuz TMA-13 Descent Module for microbial analysis on Earth.  [The activities, supported by ground specialist tagup via S-band, were documented with the Nikon D2X digital camera with SB 28DX flash attachment for downlink via OCA.]
 
 Afterwards, Yuri had another hour for his regular crew departure preparations, working on the standard end-of-increment cleanup preparatory to his return to Earth early next month.    [It is usual for crewmembers to be granted reduced workdays for making their departure preparations, as their return date approaches.] 
 
 Mike Fincke replaced batteries in his &amp; Sandra’s SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) Actiwatches, then replaced the 9V battery in the Actiwatch Reader, set up the Reader and performed downloads of data accumulated on the Actiwatches.  The devices were then temporarily stopped for later initialization.
 
 Sandy Magnus conducted another sampling round with the LOCAD-PTS (Lab-on-a-Chip Application Development-Portable Test System) Phase 2 payload, swabbing EMU gloves and using LOCAD-PTS Glucan LAL Cartridges for analysis.    [LOCAD uses small, thumb-sized “microfluidic” cartridges that are read by the experiment Reader.  The cartridges contain dried extract of horseshoe crab blood cells (LAL/Limulus amebocyte lysate) and colorless dye.  LAL tests are used for the detection and quantification of bacterial endotoxins: in the presence of the bacteria, the dried extract reacts strongly to turn the dye a green color. Therefore, the more green dye, the more microorganisms there are in the original sample.]
 
 After yesterday’s installation of the new UPA DA (Urine Processing Assembly/Distillation Assembly) and RFTA in the WRS2 (Water Recovery System 2) Rack, FE-2 Magnus later today will set up the HD (High Definition) videocam for ground observation of the UPA in action, then open the manual MV1 valve of the new RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly), take documentary photography and close up the WRS rack.     [Sandy yesterday successfully removed &amp; replaced the DA and the DA mounting hardware in the WRS rack, resolving initial difficulties in installing the mounting hardware by finally driving home 15 of the 16 attachment bolts (which cost an additional ~1.5 hr on the timeline).  Subsequently, ground controllers successfully powered-on the UPA.  Overnight ground controllers evacuated the DA in preparation for Magnus today obtaining audio, video and IWIS (Internal Wireless Instrumentation System) vibrational data while observing the DA during the Dry Spin cycle.] 
 
 FE-1 Lonchakov performed the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways, including the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Compartment)–PrK–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, FGB PGO–FGB GA, FGB GA–Node-1.    [This checkup is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently ten persons, and one of the two Russian SKV air conditioners off (SKV-1) because it is beyond its service life.]
 
 In the SM, Yuri uninstalled the TsVM2 subset, one of the three “lanes” of the Russian TsVM Central Computer System from behind panels 217 &amp; 218, each one a box measuring 25 cm high, 16 cm wide &amp; 29.5 cm deep.  The failed subset will be returned to Earth.
 
 Starting a new round of regular preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, Lonchakov worked an hour in the SM to replace its four dust filters (PF1-4).  The discarded filters were then carefully packed for return on Soyuz 17S on 4/7.
 
 Yuri is also to perform the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and performing US condensate processing (transfer from CWC to EDV containers) if condensate is available.]
 
 FE-2-18 Wakata used a DCB (Double Coldbag) to transfer the DomeGene large fixation cylinder with sample from the new ISS GLACIER freezer to MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).    [GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) units are ultra-cold freezers that store samples as low as -185 degrees C.  The GLACIER, designed and originally manufactured by the University of Alabama in Birmingham (UAB), provides a double middeck locker-sized ER (EXPRESS Rack)-compatible freezer/refrigerator for a variety of experiments that require temperatures ranging from +4 degC (39 degF) to -185 degC (-301 degF). GLACIER is part of the Cold Stowage Fleet of hardware which includes the MELFI and the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker/Incubator).] 
 
 Afterwards, the Japanese Flight Engineer is scheduled for his second PMC (Private Medical Conference) at ~7:35pm, and Koichi also has another ~70 min to himself for general orientation (station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is customary for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting station residence, if she/he chooses to take it.
 
 As a new daily activity for the ISS crew during the docked mission, begun yesterday, Koichi Wakata &amp; Sandy Magnus are scheduled for the twice-daily survey of onboard CO2 levels, using the hand-held CDMK (CO2 Monitoring Kit) for measuring ppCO2 (Carbon Dioxide partial pressure) in the ISS/Orbiter “stack”, at ~3:30pm and ~7:40pm EDT.    [The data are recorded on an onboard spreadsheet which will be downlinked once the mission is complete to support a long-term analysis of Station/Shuttle ventilation.]
 
 Sandy &amp; Koichi have another hour blocked out for standard joint “handover” activities, to be continued through the docked period ahead.   [Total generic face-to-face handover time between Sandy &amp; Koichi for 15A amounts to 13.5 hrs.]
 
 Wakata will also perform some more troubleshooting on the PCDF (Protein Crystallization Diagnostic Facility) in the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) which he worked on 3/19, today re-aligning and reconnecting the FBR Fiber Optic Cable.   [Yesterday, ESA ground controllers suspended the Go for start of science on the PCDF due to low data rate and suspect misaligned connection of a fiber optic cable.] 
 
 The CDR &amp; FE-2 have their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) scheduled, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Mike at ~1:00pm, Sandy at ~5:30pm.
 
 The crew performed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR), TVIS treadmill (FE-1/2.5h, FE-2), and ARED resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2).    [The IFM on the failed Ergometer bike in the Shuttle has been successful.  The exercise cycle is working again.  Root cause still uncertain.]
 
 RM Update:  A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked last night for the crew’s reference, updated with the latest water audit.    [The new card (18-0006Q) lists 37 CWCs (~1,017.7 L total) for the four types of water identified on board: technical water (616.3 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 110.6 L currently off-limits, filled from WPA and pending sample analysis on the ground), potable water (345.7 L, incl. 174.6 L currently off-limit because of Wautersia bacteria), condensate water (0.0 L), waste/EMU dump and other (55.7 L, including 22.2 L not to be used.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
