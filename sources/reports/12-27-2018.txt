ISS velocity increased by 0.65 meters per second (m/s) and ISS altitude was increased by 1.15 kilometers (km).
Rodent Research-8 (RR-8): Today crewmembers performed Day 1 of Rodent Research operations. The Rodent Research-8 investigation utilizes mice flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS), and maintained on Earth, to investigate the physiology of aging in response to microgravity and the role of aging in the onset and progression of disease.
