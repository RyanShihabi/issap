ISS On-Orbit Status 05/17/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FD4 (Flight Day 4) of STS-132/ULF-4.  Underway: Week 9 of Increment 23.  
 
 ISS Crew Wake – 3:20am EDT
 ISS Crew Sleep – 6:20pm
 
 Mission ULF-4’s EVA-1 was completed successfully by EV1 Garrett Reisman &amp; EV2 Steve Bowen in 7h 25m, accomplishing all objectives, with a minor modification.  Beginning this morning at 7:54am EDT, the spacewalk ended at 3:19pm.    [EV1 &amp; EV2 began their “campout” last night in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe.  Following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Reisman &amp; Bowen at 4:00am-5:10am, the A/L hatch was closed again by TJ Creamer &amp; Ken Ham for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge (~6:45am) and prebreathe in the EMUs (6:55am-7:45am).  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-1 began at 7:54am.  The excursion lasted 7h 25m.]
 
  During EVA-1, Reisman &amp; Bowen –
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Installed a redundant Ku-band SGANT (Space-to-Ground Antenna) dish and boom on the ISS Z1 truss and connected power &amp; data cables,
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Installed the EOTP (Enhanced ORU Temporary Platform) on the SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator), and
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Prepared for P6 battery replacement during EVAs -2 &amp; -3 by breaking torque on bolts holding the new batteries to the ICC-VLD2 (Integrated Cargo Carrier – Vertical Light Deployable 2) which was transferred from the Shuttle payload bay yesterday by SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System).
 
  Because of an observed 1 millimeter gap between the SGANT and the SGANT boom, the previously removed SGANT gimbal lock bolts were re-engaged, and Reisman &amp; Bowen tied down the SGANT to the boom with tethers for the time being.
  
  Before the EVA, FE-5 Noguchi –
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Powered down the amateur/ham radio equipment to prevent RF interference with the spacewalkers’ radio,
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Set up the RWS (Robotic Workstation) and DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) peripherals with the IPV (International Procedures Viewer) laptop to support SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) ops,
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Installed the crew restraints at the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation), and
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Activated the VSWs (Video Streaming Workstations) and SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops for the video “scheme” of converting RS (Russian Segment) video signals to US format and downlinking “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.
 
  While Creamer &amp; Ham provided campout &amp; prebreathe support, E-2 Caldwell-Dyson &amp; MS-4 Piers Sellers operated the Canadarm-2 SSRMS, in support of the spacewalkers during the EVA.
 
  During the EVA-1, PLT Tony Antonelli acted as IV (Intravehicular) support crewmembers, and MS-2 Michael Good was in charge of photo/video activities.
  
  At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime this morning, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  FE-1 Skvortsov did the daily morning check on the TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat container and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
  Skvortsov’s morning inspection today included the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
  Later, FE-1 conducted the 1h15m session of the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, his second, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment, supported by ground specialist tagup, was then closed out and the test data downlinked via OCA.  Kornienko took documentary photography.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
  Alexander also did the (currently daily) function check of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment hardware in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the Atlantis docked activities.
 
  In preparation for his return to gravity on 6/2 with Creamer &amp; Noguchi, Oleg Kotov undertook the first (of five) training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the Russian VELO ergometer, assisting by Mikhail Kornienko as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).     [The 50-min assessment, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground site (DO2, 6:48am-7:11am), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of Romanenko’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, today set at -20, -25, -30 and -35mmHg for five min. each while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
  Later, Kornienko &amp; Skvortsov worked several hours repairing the five broken Russian IPK-1M gas masks by replacing their flawed adaptors with new Eskiz 4640 adaptors, delivered on STS-132/Atlantis, and then also installing the new adaptors on the remaining nine half masks.    [Two adaptors of the broken IPK-1Ms were prepared for return on Soyuz 21S, the others stowed in the SM PrK (Transfer Tunnel) for disposal.]
 
  Timothy Creamer deployed new SODF (Station Operations Data Files) material in the USOS (US Segment).    [In the Lab, TJ replaced the old POC (Portable Onboard Computers) book for 15A with a new STS-132-delivered version for Exp-23, the Lab Window Shutter Constraints cue card with a new one, and moved the T2 treadmill cue card to the new T2 location in Node-3.]
 
  Mikhail completed the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.   [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1. This checkup is especially important when the ventilation/circulation system has to cope with a larger crew on board, currently twelve persons.]
 
  FE-5 Noguchi &amp; CDR Ham spent several hours on transferring cargo from the Shuttle middeck to the ISS.
 
  Working afterwards in Node-3 on the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System 2), Noguchi set up the sufficiently filled RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) for UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) processing by accessing the RFTA, reconfiguring the backfill QD (Quick Disconnect) hose, and closing out the WRS-2 for RFTA activity.
 
  Soichi also inserted 12 sample KFTs (Kennedy Fixation Tubes) for the ULF-4-delivered JAXA experiment Hydro Tropi (Hydrotropism &amp; Auxin-Inducible Gene Expression in Roots Grown under Microgravity Conditions) into MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), Dewar 4, Tray B at +2 degC.    [One of the major purposes of this experiment is to see if roots of cucumber seedlings will bend toward water when they grow in microgravity.  Another purpose is to determine the mechanism by which roots bend.  A root bends when its two sides grow differently, i.e., when the convex side grows faster than the concave side, the root bends as a result.  A plant hormone called "auxin" plays a role in this mechanism.  Auxin promotes or suppresses plant growth depending on its concentration in plants.  If auxin has a greater effect on one side of a root, growth on this side is suppressed.  Then, why does auxin work differently in the two sides of the root?  Do some hidden substances control the action of auxin?  It is another major purpose of the experiment to study the substances-the genes that control the action of auxin.]
 
  Soichi completed the periodic inspection of the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), particularly its four isolators for their condition. 
 
  After the EVA, FE-5 deactivated the video VWU/SSC “scheme” and removed the operator restraints at the Cupola RWS.
 
  Other post-ingress activities, by Ham, Bowen, Reisman, Good &amp; Creamer included the usual post-EVA tasks like photographing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) gloves for inspection, recharging EMUs with water, downloading &amp; downlinking D2XS EVA &amp; glove photographs, recharging REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly) batteries, etc.
 
  At ~6:05pm, before his sleeptime, Misha Kornienko will initiate charging the battery of the KPT-2 BAR Piren-B Pyro-endoscope instrument.    [Piren-B, a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, is part of the methods &amp; means being studied on ISS for detecting leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.]
 
  Sasha Skvortsov worked in the DC-1 Docking Compartment to set up equipment for the Russian experiment BTKh-26 KASKAD (Cascade), configuring the KT Thermostatic Container and the KRIOGEM-03 thermostat-controlled refrigerator with their power connections, then taking documentary photography.    [KASKAD will be started on 5/26, after KRIOGEM-03 has been activated at +29 degC and TK has been set to mixing mode.  The experiment investigates cultivation processes of micro-organism, animal &amp; human cells in microgravity.] 
 
  CDR Kotov worked his way through a busy list of activities, including –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3">Performing the periodic      dump (downlink) of log files of the new BRI      (SSR/Smart Switch Router) network in the SM to TsUP-Moscow via the RSS1 laptop and OCA,      for data evaluation;</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo3">Continuing the extended      leak integrity checking of the spare BZh      Liquid Unit (#056) for the Elektron      O<sub>2</sub> generator, repressed on 4/20 with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>)      to 1 atm (1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), by conducting the usual pressure check and      recharging it with N<sub>2</sub> from BPA-1M      Nitrogen Purge Unit as required to verify the unit’s      hermeticity.    [Objective of the monthly checkout of the      spare BZh,      which has been in stowage since March 2007, is to check for leakage and      good water passage through the feed line inside of the BZh (from ZL1 connector to the      buffer tank) and to check the response of the Electronics Unit’s      micro switches (signaling “Buffer Tank is Empty” &amp;      “Buffer Tank is Full”.

 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l5 level1 lfo4;text-autospace:none">Atlantis’      12-day mission delivers the Russian-built MRM-1 (Mini Research Module-1)      that will provide additional storage space and a new docking port for      Russian Soyuz &amp; Progress spacecraft.  MRM-1, also known as Rassvet (“Dawn”      in Russian), will be permanently attached to the nadir port of the      station’s FGB module.  MRM-1 will carry important hardware on its      exterior including a radiator, airlock and a European robotic arm.       Atlantis also will deliver additional station hardware stored inside a      cargo carrier.  Three spacewalks (by Reisman, Bowen &amp; Good) are      planned to stage spare components outside the station, including six spare      batteries, a Ku-band antenna and spare parts for the Canadian Dextre      robotic arm.
