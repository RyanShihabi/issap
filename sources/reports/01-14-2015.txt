Ammonia Leak False Alarm:  This morning at 3:58am CST, ISS telemetry indicated a possible leak of ammonia within Node 2 in the US Segment.  The crew performed emergency procedures and subsequently evacuated the US Segment and isolated themselves to the Russian Segment. The External Thermal Control System (ETCS) Loop B, Node 2 Low Temperature Loop (LTL), and various pieces of equipment in Node 2, Node 3, JEM, and Columbus modules were shut down as a result to this event.
Ground teams worked throughout the day to analyze the telemetry signatures. It was determined that the event was triggered by an erroneous indication from the Node 2-2 Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MDM).  The MDM has since been power cycled and the telemetry which caused the initial event is confirmed to be within normal limits.  At approximately 2:06pm CST, the Crew ingressed the US Segment wearing protective ammonia masks and tested the atmosphere as a precaution.  No indications of ammonia were detected. Flight Control Teams are working towards recovering Loop B and activating equipment that was powered down as a result of the initial response.
