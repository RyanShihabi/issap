EPIC EXT MDM: The Flight Control Team transitioned the newly installed EPIC EXT MDM to primary and completed critical checkout. 
JEM Camera Checkouts:  Both of the new JEM cameras, JEMRMS WVE and JEM EF Forward VE, were successfully checked out by ground controllers.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations:  The Robotics Ground Controllers powered up the MSS in support of US EVA #40, during which the EVA crew lubricated mechanisms in the SPDM LEE.  Post EVA, the Ground Control team checked out the newly lubricated mechanisms and then stowed the SPDM on the Mobile Base System (MBS) Power Data and Grapple Fixture (PDGF) 2.  Later tonight, the team will continue to walk the SSRMS to MBS PDGF 4.  MSS performance was nominal.
