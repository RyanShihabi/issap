ISS On-Orbit Status 12/17/10
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
Yest kasaniya!   Soyuz TMA-20/25S docked successfully at 3:11pm EST at the MRM1 “Rassvet” module, 1 min ahead of schedule, on Soyuz orbit #33 (DO2), 5 min after local sunset.  This doubles the station crew size to 6 persons and brings the total number of currently docked Russian VVs (visiting vehicles) to 4:

It was also the 69<sup>th</sup> Russian flight to ISS (out of a total of 105 missions).
 
TMA-20/25S delivered Exp-26/27 crewmembers FE-4 Dmitri Kondratyev, FE-5 Paolo Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Dr. Catherine (Cady) Coleman.    [For Kondratyev, it is the first spaceflight, for Nespoli, who flew on STS-120, it is the second, and for Coleman, past crewmember of STS-73 &amp; STS-93, it is the third.] 
Welcome aboard, Dmitri, Paolo and Cady!
 
The newcomers joined CDR Scott Kelly, FE-1 Alexander “Sasha” Kaleri &amp; FE-2 Oleg Skripochka.   After about 3 hrs spent in Soyuz on pre-transfer activities, hatches will be opened at ~6:05pm, and the crew will transfer to the ISS.  This will be followed by the traditional welcome event and the installation of the BZV QD (quick disconnect) clamps of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) by Kondratyev, to rigidize the joint.      [The Soyuz TV system was activated at ~2:30pm EST (10 km); final approach on automatic KURS pilot began at ~3:03pm.  Shortly after "kasaniya" (contact), automatic "sborka" (closing of Soyuz &amp; MRM1 nadir hooks &amp; latches) took place at ~3:12pm with ISS in free drift.  Attitude control authority had been handed over to the Russian MCS (Motion Control System) thrusters at ~11:45am and will be returned to US CMG (Control Moment Gyroscope) control at ~4:30pm.  For the docking, Russian thrusters will be disabled during Soyuz volume pressurization &amp; clamp installation (4:50pm-6:55pm) and afterwards returned to active attitude control.  Before hatch opening, the crew performs leak checks of the Soyuz modules and the Soyuz/MRM1 interface vestibule.  They then doff their Sokol suits, and Kondratyev set suits and gloves up for drying.  Dmitri also deactivates the BOA/Atmosphere Purification Unit in the SA/Descent Module, replaces the Soyuz ECLSS LiOH cartridges, equalizes Soyuz/ISS pressures, and puts the spacecraft into conservation mode on ISS integrated power.]
 
Sleep cycle shift:  To accommodate the arrival of Soyuz TMA-20/25S, crew wake/sleep cycle changes are in effect, featuring today a 4-hr “nap” &amp; 30-min “snack”, and a no-activity Saturday.
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo3">Wake –  1:00am EST (this morning, regular)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo3">Lunch – 7:00am</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo3">Midday nap – 8:00am-12:00pm</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo3">Snack – 5:05pm-5:35pm</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo3">Sleep –  1:00am (tomorrow morning, 12/18) for a very long “sleep”</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo3">Wake –  12:59am (Sunday, 12/19)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo3">Sleep –  4:30pm  (Sunday 12/19) </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo3">Wake – 1:00am (Monday, 12/20, returning to “normal”).</li></ul> 
FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Before sleeptime tomorrow morning, FE-1 Kaleri will inspect the filters again, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
CDR Kelly continued his current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Scott’s 4<sup>th</sup> session, transferring data from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, US crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
Also at wake-up, Kelly performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, his third day of the upcoming sleep shift sequence.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift (therefore, for the next sleep shift sequence RST is scheduled twice daily.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
In the “digital” Soyuz TMA-01M/24S (#701) spacecraft, docked at the MRM2 “Poisk” at FGB nadir, FE-1 Kaleri activated the GA gas analyzer in the SA/Descent Module, a periodic checkup of the cabin air.
 
Then, Kaleri set up the new Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal) with its electromagnetic unit and replaceable container for another run and initiated operation.  After about 1h20m, the hardware was disassembled &amp; stowed, and the video footage, obtained with two SONY HVR-Z1J camcorders, was downlinked.      [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS (Russian Segment): condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
CDR Kelly relocated three filled EDV-U urine containers (#958, #939, # 965) from Node-3 Port Endcone to the DC-1 Docking Compartment.
 
Alex Kaleri then configured the usual pumping equipment (Kompressor-M #41, hoses, adapters) and transferred the urine from the three USOS (US Segment) EDV-U containers to the BV1 Rodnik storage tank of Progress 40P (#408), docked at DC1 Nadir.      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
With all urine pumped over, the CDR returned the empty EDV-Us to their stowage sites in Node-3.
 
Oleg Skripochka &amp; Scott Kelly worked in the MRM1 “Rassvet” module to clear it out for the Soyuz 25S docking, relocating US &amp; Russian food containers from behind MRM1 panels to designated stowage areas in Node-1, Node-2, FGB &amp; MRM1.
 
After their 4-hr “nap”, which took from 8:00am to 12:00pm EST, Kelly &amp; Kaleri set up the Ku-band video “scheme” for covering the Soyuz docking.     [Scott activated the FGB-based A31p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for the TV conversion to NTSC &amp; Ku-band of the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera via the MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder from FGB &amp; SM (Service Module), in order to downlink “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.  Oleg meanwhile set up and checked out the RSS1 (SSC-1) laptop at the TsP (Central post) for monitoring the imagery during the MPEG-2 channel transmission.]
 
Skripochka activated &amp; verified proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the Soyuz docking.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
Afterwards, FE-2 Skripochka –

Kaleri will turn off the BRTK TVS video system for subsequent downlinking of footage.
 
RS thrusters will be inhibited from 4:50pm-6:55pm EST for the leak check and clamps installation.  Soyuz CDR Kondratyev will conduct the leak checking on the Soyuz side from ~4:50pm-6:05pm, followed by hatch opening and Crew Welcome, expected to take place at about 6:05pm-6:35pm EST, to be transmitted to the ground live on PAO TV.
 
Afterwards, Kondratyev will install the interface-rigidizing SSVP BZV quick-disconnect clamps at ~6:35pm-6:55pm.
 
The newcomers, FE-4 Dmitri Kondratyev, FE-5 Paolo Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Catherine Coleman, then join CDR Scott Kelly, FE-1 Alex Kaleri &amp; FE-2 Oleg Skripochka for the obligatory Safety Briefing by Scott (~7:20pm-8:05pm), to familiarize them with procedures and escape routes in case of an emergency. 
 
Other pre-sleeptime activities by the (now six) crewmembers will include –

At ~11:10pm EST, FE-6 Coleman is scheduled for her first PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
The crew worked out on today’s reduced physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded today were Kerguelen Is., S. Indian Ocean (significant breaks in cloud cover are predicted over the Kerguelen archipelago at the time of ISS overpass.  Looking to the left of track for the islands.  Glaciers and ice fields on the western half of the largest island are of particular interest for photography), Aurora Borealis, and Woollya Cove, Chile (HMS Beagle Site. Looking to the right of track for Woollya Cove in Tierra del Fuego.  Charles Darwin visited the Cove in 1833.  Some cloud cover was likely present.  Overlapping frames of the Cove were requested).
