ISS On-Orbit Status 02/08/12
  
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
  After wakeup this morning (~1:00am EST), FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
  CDR Burbank &amp; FE-5 Kuipers completed Day 5 of their (currently) daily electronic logging of diet for the Low Salt Diet protocol of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity).  Today’s activities, besides diet logging, involved taking blood samples for PCBA (Portable Clinical Blood Analyzer) analysis and preservation in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) as well as starting 24-hr urine collections.        [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Paolo is ingesting special diet (Session 1 – High salt diet which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level, Session 2 – Low salt diet.  SOLO Diet starts with breakfast on Day 1.  Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 &amp; 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged &amp; inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
  FE-2 Ivanishin performed his 3<sup>rd</sup> MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) test, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, along with PZEh-MO-8 body mass measurement using the IM device.       [Supported by the RSS-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM, the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with Anatoly’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.]
 
  In the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-6 Pettit configured the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware including MBS (Mixing Bag System), including calibrating the PPFS software and checking instruments, and then conducted his 2<sup>nd</sup> session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake &amp; Submaximal Estimates of VO<sub>2</sub>max before, during and after long-duration space station missions) assessment, integrated with Thermolab (head sensors).  After the session, Don powered down, cleaned up &amp; partially stowed the equipment, and downloaded the data to a PCS laptop.       [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
  Continuing their paced preparations for the Orlan EVA-30 spacewalk next week (2/16) and the suited dry-run on Tuesday (2/14), FE-4 Kononenko &amp; FE-1 Shkaplerov worked on their Orlan-MK space suits.  Specifically, they –
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Adjusted space suit height to their dimensions (suit #4 for Oleg, suit #6 for Anton),
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Performed Orlan and BSS Orlan Interface Unit leak checks &amp; valve tests,
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Conducted pressure checks of the primary BK-3M oxygen tanks in the DC1 airlock compartment &amp; SM PkhO Transfer Compartment,
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Installed the batteries for the BRTA suit telemetry systems, and
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Staged NASA ORUs and other gear for Orlan use.
 
  In the Kibo JPM, CDR Burbank worked ~1h 30m on readying &amp; starting the new BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) experiment, first setting up a clear sample view for photographing Sample 1 with “structure or haze” optimum illumination, then preparing a new sample (#4) for the experiment.  Don Pettit assisted by taking documentary photography.  Before “Presleep” period tonight, Dan will replace the BCAT-6 battery with a fresh one.        [Activities included installing the G1 high-resolution camcorder for MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) video capture, unstowing the SGSM (Slow Growth Sample Module) and photographing Sample 1 manually with the NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC (Station Support Computer).  After arranging the lighting for “clear” sample (as opposed to “turbid”), Dan homogenized (mixed) Sample 4 and then set up the latter for automated flash photography controlled by EarthKAM software.  The new EK software photographs Sample 4 once every two hours for seven days, and Burbank performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.]
 
  Afterwards, Burbank worked on the HMS CMRS (Health Maintenance System - Crew Medical Restraint System) in the Lab, repairing frayed CMRS operator restraint pouches with tape.      [Three pouches of five were frayed.  Dan repaired all three and put photos in SSC-8 (Station Support Computer 8) for downlink.]
 
  CDR also deactivated the CUCU (COTS UHF Communications Unit), which had been tested by ground commanding in preparation for the SpaceX “Dragon” visit later this year.
 
  Anatoly closed out the completed water transfer from Progress 46P’s BV1 tank to the SM Rodnik BV1 tank..
 
  Later, Oleg Kononenko worked in the DC1 Docking Compartment to start the regular urine transfer from  EDV-U containers (879, 984, 997, 998, 981) to the BV1 Rodnik water storage tank of Progress 46P (#414), docked at DC1, using the usual pumping equipment with the electric compressor (#41) and then flushed the BV1 line with water.       [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
  With the G1 HD camcorder set up in the JAXA Kibo laboratory and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) activated for downlinking his activity, André Kuipers conducted another “LEGO Bricks” EPO (Education Payload Activity) session in the JPM MWA (Maintenance Work Area), building a model of a Windmill from Lego pieces from a guide book for ground audiences.
 
  At ~9:05am EST, the six crewmembers joined for a one-hour review and practice session familiarizing themselves with a new respirator mask donning and purging technique, as walked-through by ground personnel on an uplinked video.      [The crewmembers were invited to practice the donning up to twice on their designated mask, with instructors standing by on the ground for questions during the OBT (Onboard Training).]
 
  Ivanishin serviced the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), setting up new Bubble dosimeters for recording radiation traces, initializing &amp; deploying the detectors and verifying proper function of the setup with the LULIN-5 electronics box.    [A total of eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (A41-A48) were initialized in the Bubble dosimeter reader in the SM and positioned at their exposure locations, three in the spherical “Phantom” unit on the MRM1 panel and five in the SM (two in starboard crew cabin on both sides of the MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) dosimeter detector unit, two under the work table, and one at panel 410).  The deployment locations of the detectors were photo-documented with the NIKON D2X camera and also reported to TsUP via log sheet via OCA.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested figurines.]
 
  With its battery freshly charged overnight, Anatoly used the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware at SM window #9 and the overnight freshly charged FSS photo spectrograph battery, taking pictures of the Moon disk with the FSS.       [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module.]
 
  Working ~2 hrs in the MRM1 Rassvet module on the Russian SPOPT (Fire Detection &amp; Suppression System), Shkaplerov removed three old electro-inductive IDZ-2 smoke detectors and replaced them with the newer IDZ-3 units.
 
  Later, Anton completed his 7<sup>th</sup> data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.         [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
  Oleg performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
  Anatoly took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  At ~10:05am, André contacted the ground for a scheduled teleconference to discuss his physical exercise regime.
 
  CDR &amp; FE-6 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Dan at ~12:30am, Don a ~11:50am EST.
 
  Before Presleep, Don Pettit will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Don will turn MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
  Pettit &amp; Burbank each had another time slot reserved for making entries in their electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
  At ~10:05am, FE-6 powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 10:15am conducted a ham radio session with students at Inuksuk High School, Iqaluit Nunavut, Canada.   [Possibly in attendance: The Governor General of Canada, His Excellency David Lloyd Johnston.]
 
  At ~10:45am, Burbank &amp; Pettit supported a PAO TV event, downlinking their answers to questions submitted by viewers on YouTube.
 
  At ~1:30pm, Dan conducted the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
  The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2, FE-4.

Australia (HMS BEAGLE SITE.   Looking right for this major bay, recognizable by its highly convoluted coastline.  In February 1836 Darwin landed here, but the stop seems to have been unimportant for his natural history studies. Darwin hosted a great dance for the local aboriginal people.  The Beagle ran aground in a storm when setting sail but was refloated. The first European explorer to discover King George Sound was the Englishman George Vancouver in 1791).
