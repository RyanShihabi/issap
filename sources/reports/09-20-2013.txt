Cygnus Status: In preparation for Cygnus operations this weekend, the crew was scheduled for a half-duty day today. Cygnus systems continue to function nominally.  The spacecraft performed its 4th planned phasing burn (DV-4) today at 1:11 p.m. CDT. NASA teams are reviewing the Demo 1 results this afternoon in preparation for Saturday’s ISS Mission Management Team (IMMT) Go/No-Go poll for Joint Operations. Cygnus berthing to ISS remains on schedule for Sunday, 22 September 06:25 CDT.
Cygnus Robotics On-Board Training (OBT):  Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Parmitano and FE-6 Nyberg continued their Robotic practice using an onboard simulator.  The session had the crew perform two Capture Point (CP) hold runs gaining proficiency on camera configurations, captures, free drift timing, malfunctions, nominal rate approaches, and several 2 meter approaches.
Diapason Experiment:  Yesterday Parmitano set up the Diapason instrument in Node 2 and performed the second of five experiment runs. Today he performed the third run. This experiment studies nano-particle migration and capture achieved by very small thermal gradients. The particle size range of 2 nm to 1 micron allows the monitoring of combustion-generated pollution and the identification of atmospheric contaminants on-board ISS.
Node 3 Major Constituent Analyzer (MCA) Status:  A full MCA calibration was successfully performed overnight. The MCA is now producing Spec Accuracy readings. Therefore, the crew is no longer being scheduled to report Portable Oxygen Monitor (POM) and Carbon Dioxide Monitor (CDM) readings.
