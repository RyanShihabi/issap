ISS On-Orbit Status 05/13/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   More time off for the crew..
 
 At wake-up, FE-1 Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).   [FE-1 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Sasha also did the daily morning check on the TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat container and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
 CDR Kotov stowed the Sokol suits &amp; gloves used in yesterday’s Soyuz relocation, after their dry-out.
 
 Afterwards, Kotov worked on the RSE1 laptop, installing software upgrade Vers. 1.4 on its main hard drive, then rebooted and closed out by bringing the laptop to nominal configuration.    [The upgrade provides support for new “Pyren” hardware operation and includes a new photo processing application.]
 
 FE-6 Creamer undertook a session of the U.S. PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol as subject, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on BP &amp; ECG during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with the BP/ECG (blood pressure/electrocardiograph) and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.  FE-5 Noguchi assisted as Operator/CMO.     [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.]
 
 In the SM (Service Module), FE-3 Kornienko collected KAV condensate water samples from the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor (water recovery system) upstream of the FGS gas/liquid mixture filter/separator in an empty drink bag, a periodic check on the performance of the FGS, then removed sampler &amp; separator and disposed of flush water as per instructions.    [The bag was prepared for return on Soyuz TMA-17/21S.]
 
 Kornienko also performed the periodic sampling of the cabin atmosphere, looking for CO (Carbon Monoxide) in the SM with the IPD-CO Draeger tubes, and for air constituents with two AK-1M samplers in SM &amp; FGB.
 
 Afterwards, Mikhail started the 6<sup>th</sup> onboard run of the Russian SSTV (Slow Scan TV) equipment of the MAI-75 experiment as part of OBR-3 (Obrazovanie-3, Education 3) ops, essentially an ARISS ham radio set-up with Kenwood TM D700 Transceiver and Kenwood VS-N1 (Visual Communicator) gear for downlinking photographic images of the overflown terrain to ground stations (MAI, Kursk, Star City &amp; other stations around the world).  Later in the day, the radio session was terminated and the equipment closed out.  The second of the back-to-back sessions is scheduled tomorrow.     [The payload is named after the renowned MAI (Moscow Aviation Institute) whose reputation is based on the large number of famous aviators and rocket scientists that received their academic education here.  Among the alumni are Academicians and Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Over 100 General and Chief Designers earned their degree at MAI, with famous rocket scientists like Makeyev, Mishin, Nadiradze and Yangel.  MAI also fostered 20 Pilot-Cosmonauts, almost 100 famous test pilots, Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia.  The amateur radio (ham) equipment aboard the ISS for downlinking SSTV imagery is a MAI product.]
 
 After yesterday’s Soyuz relocation, Oleg Kotov checked out the STTS intermodule hard-line communication channel (MBS) between the SM (comm panel 6) and the 21S spacecraft as well as two-way communications between 21S and TsUP via RGS (Russian Groundsite).
 
 Working in the SM on the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, Skvortsov disconnected a cable from the 3SPN1 pump panel of the KOB-1 loop and inspected the cable’s connector (DP-Kh3) with a magnifying glass to assess whether it can be replaced.  Photographs were also taken for ground review.    [For the activity, BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system &amp; VD-SU control mode had to be turned off, which also required temporary deactivation of the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.  There are four pump panels on the two SOTR KOB loops, each pump panel with two operating ENA micropumps.]
 
 With the Elektron still turned off, CDR Kotov replaced the BPA Nitrogen Purge Unit from the Elektron assembly with a fresh unit, discarding the old tank after venting its residual nitrogen into the cabin atmosphere.
 
 Afterwards, Skvortsov supported TsUP in reactivating the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator by throwing a switch and monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.    [Measurements were taken twice, 3-4 minutes apart, with the temperature probe of the Elektronika MultiMeter.  If BD temperature exceeded 50 degC, Elektron had to be turned off.  The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]
 
 Sasha also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Oleg performed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 FE-5 Noguchi undertook his third session with the JAXA experiment BIORHYTHMS (Biological Rhythms), for which he donned the electrodes of the DWH (Digital Walk Holter) for ECG (Electrocardiogram) recording, then started the data take for the next 24 hrs.
 
 For the JAXA experiment HAIR, Soichi again collected a hair sample from TJ Creamer as he had done first on 1/19.
 
 Noguchi also spent another ~30 min gathering &amp; prepacking return cargo for ULF-4.
 
 Timothy Creamer prepared the CGBA-6 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 6) payload for return to Earth, decabling it and removing items from the unit that need to remain in stowage on ISS.
 
 Later, TJ conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.    [The current card (23-0003G) lists 105 CWCs (2,607.1 L total) for the five types of water now identified on board: 1. technical water (24 CWCs with 949.3 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 428 L in 12 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 387.1 L in 9 bags still requiring sample analysis,  2. potable water (9 CWCs with 366.7 L, of which 2 bags with 66.6 L require sample analysis, 4 bags with 170.8 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use,  3. iodinated water (63 CWCs with 1,158.6 L),  4. condensate water (7 bags with 106.2 L, including 2 CWCs with 43.4 L that are to be used with microbial filter, and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (2 CWCs with 26.3 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 TJ &amp; Soichi had ~30 min set aside for regular crew departure preparations, working on the standard end-of-increment cleanup preparatory to their return.     [It is usual for crewmembers to be granted reduced workdays for making their departure preparations, as their return date approaches.]
 
 At ~4:06am EDT, Noguchi conducted his regular tagup with the Japanese Flight Control Team at SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center)/Tsukuba via S-band/audio.   [This conference is scheduled once every week, between the ISS crewmembers and SSIPC.]
 
 At ~6:40am, Kotov, Noguchi &amp; Creamer downlinked PAO TV messages of congratulations &amp; greetings to the promoters, participants &amp; guests of the Kioko Sinkai Karate Third World Cup event in the Spanish city of Estepona.    [Kioko Sinkai Karate is the synthesis of the best martial arts of the East, famous for a hard style of power contact.  Legendary Masutatsu Oyama is the founder of the style.  The complete notion of “Kioko Sinkai Karate” is interpreted as harmonious combination of traditional martial arts of the East with the best achievements of the present-day sports.]
 
 At ~2:20pm, all crewmembers convened for their standard bi-weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office (Steve Lindsey), via S-band S/G-2 audio &amp; phone patch.
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-06) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-3).
 
 For his T2 exercise session, Soichi donned the Glenn treadmill harness with installed transducer instrumentation, then activated the harness.  It was Soichi’s 5<sup>th</sup> T2 harness take.     [Afterwards, FE-5 downloaded the harness data (including achieved “body weight”) and filled out a survey questionnaire to complete the SDTO (Station Development Test Objective).  The harness SDTO uses both TVIS and T2.]
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Hyderabad, India (ISS had a nadir pass over this large Indian metropolis. Some light cloud cover may have been present.  Overlapping, nadir-viewing mapping frames taken along track as the station passed over the urban area were requested), Ankara, Turkey (weather was predicted to be clear during this nadir pass over this capital city.  Overlapping frames of the urban area were requested to provide context for higher resolution imagery), Dakar, Senegal (ISS had a nadir pass over this westernmost African capital.  Overlapping frames of the urban area and surrounding peninsula were requested to provide context for higher resolution imagery), Soufriere Hills Volcano, Caribbean (this active volcano occupies the southern half of the island of Montserrat.  Overlapping nadir-viewing mapping frames of the southern half of the island were requested, as this will capture both the active areas of the volcano and volcanic deposits), Tegucigalpa, Honduras (ISS had a nadir pass over this capital city.  Some cloud cover may have been present.  Overlapping frames of the urban area were requested to provide context for higher resolution imagery), and Nassau, Bahamas (ISS had a nadir overpass of this island capital; some cloud cover may have been present.  Nassau is located on the eastern half of New Providence Island.  Overlapping frames of the urban area and New Providence Island were requested.
 
 STS-132/Atlantis/ULF-4 Flight Plan Preview:
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Atlantis’ 12-day mission will deliver the Russian-built MRM-1 (Mini Research Module-1) that will provide additional storage space and a new docking port for Russian Soyuz &amp; Progress spacecraft.  MRM-1, also known as Rassvet (“Dawn” in Russian), will be permanently attached to the nadir port of the station’s FGB module.  MRM-1 will carry important hardware on its exterior including a radiator, airlock and a European robotic arm.  Atlantis also will deliver additional station hardware stored inside a cargo carrier.  Three spacewalks (by Reisman, Bowen &amp; Good) are planned to stage spare components outside the station, including six spare batteries, a Ku-band antenna and spare parts for the Canadian Dextre robotic arm.  Shuttle mission STS-132 is the final scheduled flight for Atlantis. </li> </ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Launch:       5/14, 2:20pm EDT</li><li>Docking:      5/16, 10:20am</li><li>Undocking:  5/23, 11:12am</li><li>Landing:      5/26, 8:36am.</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Atlantis, on its last flight, is crewed by</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>CDR – Ken Ham (Prime Loadmaster) </li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>PLT  – Tony Antonelli </li><li>MS1 – Garrett Reisman (EV1)</li><li>MS2 – Mike Good  (EV3)</li><li>MS3 – Steve Bowen (EV2) </li><li>MS4 – Piers Sellers</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>MRM-1 Main Activities:</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>FD2: Ku Scheme/Video Test for MRM-1 Docking </li></ul> <ol style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 108pt; "> <li>Setup and testing will be similar to Soyuz Docking video</li><li>Equipment left in place until FD5</li></ol> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>FD5: MRM-1 Docking (performed by STS crew)</li></ul> <ol start="3" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 108pt; "> <li>SRMS unberth MRM-1 from PLB</li><li>SRMS handoff MRM-1 to SSRMS</li><li>SSRMS will berth to FGB Nadir</li><li>RS laptop deployed in USOS for docking ops</li></ol> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>FD7:  MRM-1 Hatch Open/Leak Check </li></ul> <ol start="7" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 108pt; "> <li>Initial ingress to scrub air</li><li>Hatch will be left “ajar”</li><li>Final, full ingress to occur TBD date post flight </li></ol> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Other Main Activities:</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 72pt; "> <li>FD3: Dock and ICC Unberth; Campout</li><li>FD4: EVA1 (5/17, 8:14am)</li><li>FD5: MRM-1 Docking to FGB Nadir and Focused Inspection; Campout</li><li>FD6: EVA 2 (5/19, 7:44am)</li><li>FD7: STS Water Dump and MRM-1 Hatch Open (5/20, 6:34am); Campout</li><li>FD8: EVA 3 (5/21, 7:14am)</li><li>FD9: ICC Berthing in PLB and Reboost</li><li>FD10: Undock </li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Focused inspection is nominally planned for FD5, though due to limited time availability this activity may be scheduled on its own flight day, if required.
