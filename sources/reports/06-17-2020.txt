Repository: The crew performed Urine and blood collections in support of the Repository study. Repository supports scientific discovery that contributes to our fundamental knowledge in the area of human physiological changes and adaptation to a microgravity environment and provides unique opportunities to study longitudinal changes in human physiology spanning many missions.
RED-EYE: The crew took photos of the REDEYE-2 satellite deployment. The RED-EYE program develops and demonstrates technologies which increase the utility of low-cost microsatellites using the KABER Micro Satellite Deployer attached to the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM).
Electrolysis Measurement (EM): In support of the ongoing EM experiment, the crew performed a series of sample exchanges. Electrolytic Gas Evolution Under Microgravity (Electrolysis Measurement) examines the influence of gravity on electrolytic gas evolution, a complex electrochemical process with multiple applications on Earth and in space. For example, electrolysis generates bubbles that can be used to create pressure differentials in microfluidic devices, such as skin patches, used to deliver medications. Microgravity makes it possible to single out bubble growth and study its effect on the process.

Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations: The crew continues to prepare for the upcoming S6 battery upgrades. Today the crew reviewed procedures throughout the day and then participated in a conference with the ground. The crew also practiced donning the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) to the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) to gain efficiency in preparing to suit up the day of the EVA. The first of two EVAs to replace the batteries on Channel 1B is scheduled for Friday, June 26.
