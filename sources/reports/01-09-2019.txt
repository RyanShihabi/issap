SpaceX-16 Dragon Status:  The crew had completed cargo loading into the Dragon vehicle this morning in preparation for its departure tomorrow.  However, due to weather conditions at the planned splashdown zone in the Pacific Ocean, Dragon departure from ISS has been delayed. Teams are assessing the next opportunity to release Dragon on Sunday, January 13.    
STaARS BioScience-4 (Space Technology and Advanced Research Systems):  As a result of Dragon’s departure delay, the crew removed the stowed STaARS Bioscience-4 containers from Dragon and re-installed them back into the STaARS facility. The STaARS BioScience-4 investigation examines how oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) react to microgravity, specifically the rate at which the cells proliferate and differentiate in the microgravity environment.
