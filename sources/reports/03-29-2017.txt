Dose Tracker Data Entry: The crew performed their weekly Dose Tracker data logging, responding to a questionnaire which asks if crew members have used medications since the last entry, what prompted them to use the medication, how well it worked, how frequently they repeated doses, and if the medication caused side effects. The Dose Tracker investigation uses an iPad app to collect information on members’ medication use during their missions. Results help determine whether medicines act differently on humans in space than they do on Earth. 
European Space Agency (ESA) Active Dosimeter Swap: The crew swapped the currently worn Mobile Unit (MU) with a charged MU and initiated the data download to the ESA Active Dosimeter Personal Stowage Device (PSD).  The European Crew Personal Active Dosimeter is an active device worn by European ISS crewmembers in orbit to measure the radiation exposure. This device, coupled with other dosimeters in ESA’s Columbus Laboratory, provides radiation dosage information that can be used to support risk assessment and dose management. The future goal is to enable the verification of radiation monitoring systems for future medical monitoring of crewmembers in space.
U.S. Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #41 Preparations: In preparation for tomorrow’s planned EVA, today the crew completed the following:

Configured tools required for the EVA.
Verified that batteries are installed in Pistol Grip Tools (PGTs) and EVA cameras.
Prepared the Equipment Lock, EMUs and ancillary hardware to support EVA prep activities.
Procedures review including detailed timeline, briefing package, tool config summary and planned get-ahead tasks.

Following the procedures review the crew participated in a conference with ground teams to discuss questions or concerns. The crew is scheduled to egress at 7:10AM CDT.
