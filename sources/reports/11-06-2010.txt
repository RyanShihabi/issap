ISS On-Orbit Status 11/06/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – crew off duty.   &gt;&gt;&gt;Last day on Daylight Saving Time.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
  CDR Wheelock, FE-6 Walker &amp; FE-3 Kelly continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 7<sup>th</sup> for Wheels &amp; Shannon, 2<sup>nd</sup> for Scott, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Also after wake-up, CDR, FE-6 &amp; FE-3 performed another session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.      [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  At day’s begin, FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
  
  The three Russian Flight Engineers performed the regular weekly two-hour task of thorough cleaning of their RS (Russian Segment) home.     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises.]
  
  As part of the Uborka house cleaning, the Russian crewmembers conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  Later, Alex also performed the regular maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems (UOV) in the SM &amp; FGB, cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
  
  Shannon Walker completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router &amp; FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops (the latter required to mitigate the problem of iPV and OSTPV not opening up procedures due to a memory leak in the “Tomcat” software).  After a period of no less than 10 min later, FE-6 also rebooted the two ISS network servers (SERVER1 &amp; 2).
 
  FE-5 Yurchikhin performed the periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), collecting eight Bubble dosimeter kits (A21-A28) and reading their recorded radiation traces in a special Reader.  Data (exposure duration from initialization, bubble quantity, dose) were recorded on a log sheet and downlinked via OCA.     [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]
 
  FE-1 Kaleri meanwhile did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Later, Fyodor &amp; Oleg teamed up to continue preparations for their EVA-26 spacewalk on 11/15 and dry-run on 11/12, first activating Orlan-MK spacesuits #4 &amp; #5, then configuring special personal Orlan gear including KVO liquid cooling garments, ShL-10S comm headsets, LP-10KM gloves, BK-10 thermal comfort undergarments, cotton socks, pure wool socks and diapers.
 
  Afterwards, Yurchikhin checked out the POV EVA support panel in the DC1 Docking Compartment, while Skripochka tested POV in the SM PkhO (Transfer Compartment).
 
  At ~8:40am EDT, the Russian crewmembers conducted the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared by TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.      [With the slip of STS-133/ULF5 to not earlier than 11/30, MCC-Houston specialists are in the process of replanning onboard crew activities for the week ahead.]
 
  At ~4:05pm, Shannon is scheduled for her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
  A new item added to the discretionary “job jar” task list for Wheels, Scott &amp; Shannon calls for the tear-down &amp; stowage of the BPSMU (Battery Powered Speaker Microphone Unit) equipment with its long drag-through cabling, not now required until Discovery’s arrival in early December.
