ISS On-Orbit Status 06/04/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – crew rest day.
 
At wake-up, Garan conducted another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, his 20<sup>th</sup>.      [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
The three crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of the uborka house cleaning, CDR Borisenko &amp; FE-1 Samokutyayev completed regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM (Service Module), preceded by documentary photography, and the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on its total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
Samokutyayev also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
At ~10:00am EDT, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
Performing periodic service on MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker/Incubator) in the Lab (O4_D1), FE-3 Garan moved the contents of the cold storage container into MERLIN-2 next to it, removed the desiccants in MERLIN, and propped the door open so the unit can dry out prior to return on STS-135/ULF-7.
 
On Day 2 of the ongoing SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop reloading with software v.4 (SSCV4), the crew had ~30 min set aside for moving their personal data from SSC clients to T61p USB 120 GB hard drives in preparation for Monday’s &amp; Tuesday’s SSCV4 transition activities.      [Of the (currently) 24 SSC laptops in the ISS (SM: 3, Node-3: 1, Node-1: 1, A/L: 1, Cupola: 3, Lab: 7. JPM: 1, Node-2: 6, COL: 1), 13 will be reloaded with v.4 by the ground, 7 by the crew.  After replacement of the remaining IBM A31p laptops with Lenovo T61p’s, the machines will be configured by the crew (12) &amp; ground (9), leaving at the end 23 T61b SSCs in service.]
 
FE-1 &amp; FE-3 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sasha at ~4:45am Ron at ~11:25am EDT.

The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).
