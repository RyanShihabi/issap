ISS On-Orbit Status 10/25/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – a well-earned full-rest day for the crew.   Ahead: Week 3 of Increment 21.
 
  At day begin, FE-1 Suraev did the regular daily check of the new aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which he installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) and hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).    [FE-1 again inspects the filters tonight at bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  Later, Maxim performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  The FE-1 also checked up on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP-Moscow.
 
  FE-5 Williams supported once again the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  FE-4 Thirsk completed the now regular transfer of pre-treated Russian urine directly from an EDV-U container into the US Lab UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) for processing, done each morning for about 5 minutes.
 
  The crew performed their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR, FE-2, FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1). 
 
  All six crewmembers had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Frank de Winne at ~6:31am and again at ~11:10am, Roman Romanenko at ~7:05am, Maxim Suraev at ~8:10am, Nicole Stott at ~12:50pm, Jeff Williams at ~2:50p EDT.
 
  Suggested work items on Maxim’s &amp; Roman’s Russian discretionary task list for today were –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">a photography run of the GFI-8 "Uragan"      (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D2X digital camera (with      800mm telelens),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">a session for Russia's EKON Environmental      Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of      environmental conditions on Earth using the Nikon D2X with the SIGMA      300-800mm telephoto lens,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">more photography with the      ocean observations program DZZ-13      “Seiner” to obtain data on color field patterns and      current cloud cover conditions over dynamic ocean areas, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">the periodic status check      on the Russian BIO-5      Rasteniya-2      ("Plants-2") experiment in the SM where plants, currently Mizuna, are studied      under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-16      greenhouse. </li> </ul>
