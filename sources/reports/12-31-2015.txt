Combustion Integration Rack (CIR) Fuel Oxidizer Management Assembly (FOMA) Remove and Replace: Kopra changed out the CIR FOMA which is the first step in the calibration and recertification required prior to the start of the FLame Extinguishment Experiment (FLEX)-2 experiment scheduled for January. The calibration and certification is scheduled for next week.  FLEX-2 uses small droplets of fuel to study the special spherical characteristics of burning fuel droplets in space. The experiment studies how quickly fuel burns, the conditions required for soot to form, and how mixtures of fuels evaporate before burning. Understanding these processes could lead to the production of a safer spacecraft as well as increased fuel efficiency for engines using liquid fuel on Earth.
 
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Launch Enclosure Operations: Kopra removed EMU 3008 from the EMU launch enclosure and installed it on the EMU Don/Doff Assembly (EDDA) while the launch enclosure panels were re-installed without an EMU inside. At a future date EMU 3005 will be installed in the launch enclosure for return to Earth on a SpX. Kopra then removed Space Suit Assembly (SSA) soft covers from EMU 3008 and installed on EMU 3003 for Foreign Object Debris (FOD) prevention.
 
Cargo Operations:  Today, Kelly participated in a Stowage Conference discussing Cygnus cargo choreography, then continued transferring cargo from the Cygnus vehicle to ISS.  Peake unpacked cargo that arrived on 62P.
 
ISS Safety Video Survey:  Kelly obtained video of the interior volume of the ISS which allows ground teams to assess the current vehicle configuration and identify areas of concern. This survey is performed approximately every 6 months to identify ventilation blockage, flammability hazards, emergency egress paths, access to fire ports and safety equipment.
