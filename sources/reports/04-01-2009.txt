ISS On-Orbit Status 04/01/09
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Day 5 of joint E18/19 operations for CDR Fincke, CDR-19 Padalka, FE-1 Lonchakov, FE-1-19 Barratt, FE-2 Wakata, and SFP Simonyi.
 
 FE-2 Wakata started out with Day 7 of his first week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), using payload software for data downloading and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s session file on the HRF-1 laptop.    [To monitor the crewmember’s sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, Koichi wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him as well as his patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days, as part of the crew’s discretionary “job jar” task list.] 
 
 CDR Fincke completed the third &amp; last day of his FD (Flight Day) 180 session with the NASA/JSC experiment NUTRITION w/Repository, his fifth, after collecting urine samples for the last 24 hrs and taking blood samples.    [After performing phlebotomy with the help of Dr. Mike Barratt, i.e., drawing blood samples (from an arm vein), Mike’s samples were first allowed to coagulate in the Repository for 20-30 minutes, then spun in the HRF RC (Human Research Facility/Refrigerated Centrifuge) and finally placed in MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  No thruster activity was allowed during the blood drawing.  The RC was later powered off after a temperature reset to limit wear on the compressor, and cleaned. The NUTRITION project is the most comprehensive in-flight study done by NASA to date of human physiologic changes during long-duration space flight.  It includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, nutritional assessments, and hormonal changes, expanding the previous Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) testing in three ways: Addition of in-flight blood &amp; urine collection (made possible by supercold MELFI dewars), normative markers of nutritional assessment, and a return session plus 30-day (R+30) session to allow evaluation of post-flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation.] 
 
 CDR-19 Padalka &amp; FE-1 Lonchakov, as a handover, collected the periodic readings of potentially harmful atmospheric contaminants in the SM, using the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M Real-Time Harmful Contaminant Gas Analyzer suite, today using preprogrammed microchips to measure for Ammonia (NH3) and Carbon Monoxide (CO).
 
 In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Wakata worked on the ESA DMS (Data Management System), unstowing, mounting, installing and activating the PWS2 (Portable Work Station 2).  Later in the day, Koichi deactivated the PWS1 and the PWS2, then configured the PWS software.
 
 Also in COL, as part of FSL (Fluid Sciences Laboratory) commissioning, the FE-2 performed a functionality check on the EBOX-3 lamp of the CEM-U (Central Experiment Module – Upper).
 
 FE-1 Lonchakov ran tests on the DAKON-M equipment of the Russian experiment TEKh-15/IZGIB (“Bend”) which had taken measurements from 3/27-29 during the Soyuz docking, with no results showing up on the USB flash device.  Yuri’s troubleshooting tried to identify the cause of this absence.   [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
 For Yuri, with Gennady attending for handover, it was time again for recharging the Motorola Iridium-9505A satellite phone brought up on Soyuz 17S, a monthly routine job and his fourth time.      [After retrieving it from its location in the TMA-13/17S Descent Module (BO), the crewmembers initiated the recharge of its lithium-ion battery, monitoring the process every 10-15 minutes as it took place.  Upon completion at ~2:00pm EDT, the phone was returned inside its SSSP Iridium kit and stowed back in the BO’s operational data files (ODF) container.  The satphone accompanies returning ISS crews on Soyuz reentry &amp; landing for contingency communications with SAR (Search-and-Rescue) personnel after touchdown (e.g., after an “undershoot” ballistic reentry, as happened during the recent 15S return).  The Russian-developed procedure for the monthly recharging has been approved jointly by safety officials.  During the procedure, the phone is left in its fire-protective fluoroplastic bag with open flap. The Iridium 9505A satphone uses the Iridium constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to relay the landed Soyuz capsule's GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates to helicopter-borne recovery crews.  The older Iridium-9505 phones were first put onboard Soyuz in August 2003.  The newer 9505A phone, currently in use, delivers 30 hours of standby time and three hours of talk, up from 20 and two hours, respectively, on the older units.] 
 
 Mike Fincke performed the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [These include the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Compartment)–PrK–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, FGB PGO–FGB GA, FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 In the US Airlock (A/L), the CDR terminated the regeneration process on the first set of METOX (Metal Oxide) CO2 absorption canisters (#0005, #0007) used in the recent 15A spacewalks, then  started the “bakeout” on the second set (#0011, #0012).  More to come.
 
 At ~5:10pm EDT, just before sleep time, Gennady Padalka will set up the Russian MBI-12 SONOKARD (Sonocard) payload and start his first experiment session, using a sports shirt from the SONOKARD kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.     [SONOKARD objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
 A new item added to Padalka’s discretionary task list, in this case as “mandatory”, is to create a video of “Life in the ISS” of himself and Mike Fincke.    [The footage is intended for a documentary being prepared by the TV company TVTs for the recent successful Russian contest for children to create the crew patch for Soyuz TMA-14.  The video should be downlinked on 4/5, and the documentary will be premiered on 4/11 by Roskosmos to promote Russia’s activities in space.]
 
 The joint crew again had several hours of generic handover time scheduled, between Yuri &amp; Gennady, Col. Mike &amp; Dr. Mike, and Koichi &amp; Dr. Mike.
 
 The CDR conducted the periodic status check on the running payloads CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) and ENose (Electronic Nose), both located in the ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2).
 
 In the SM, Gennady, with Yuri, completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).  [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Charles Simonyi and the two Russian crewmembers had two hours set aside for scheduled commemorative (Russian: “symbolic”) activities, a standard tradition for visiting guests and departing expedition crewmembers.   [The crew members stamped and signed “Cosmonautics Day” (April 12) letter envelopes for the Simvolika 17P kit and the Russian Postal Services kit, stowing the kits in the Soyuz TMA-13 Descent Module.] 
 
 Mike Barratt had an hour to review and familiarize himself with another CMS (Countermeasures Systems) exercise device, today the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the SM, guided by Mike Fincke as required.
 
 Fincke, Wakata &amp; Lonchakov completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS (FE-2), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1/2.5h), and ARED resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2).
 
 Scheduled VC-16 activities for SFP Charles Simonyi today included –
 <ul><li>Reading accumulated data from his personal dosimeter (A0306) of the “Pille-MKS” radiation suite and resetting it to zero,  <li>Taking the Russian cardiological health test PZEh MO-1 (“Study of the Bioelectric Activity of the Heart at Rest”) on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System), with Gennady Padalka assisting [equipment used were VPG/Temporal Pulsogram and ECG/Electrocardiogram Data Output Devices (USI).  During the 30-min. test, the SFP tagged up with ground specialists on an RGS (Russian Groundsite) pass at ~6:15am EDT via VHF for data downlink from the VPG &amp; Gamma-1M ECG for about 5-6 minutes], <li>Holding the daily VHF comm session with his Consultants Team at TsUP/Moscow,  <li>Conducting a ham radio pass,  <li>Performing onboard photo/video operations,  <li>Participating in the Symbolic Activity event,  <li>Working with his email,  <li>Conducting a private conference with the ground via his IP-Phone, and  <li>Performing Earth photography plus copying the pictures to his HDD (Hard Disk Drive) for return. 
 </li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>Simonyi, Barratt and Padalka had their PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Charles at ~7:40am, Dr. Mike at ~1:10pm, Gennady at ~1:25pm.
 
 At ~3:20am EDT, Fincke powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and conducted, at 3:25am, a ham radio exchange with students at Kalori Catholic School, Wallaroo, Australia.     [Kalori Catholic School is located in Wallaroo, on the Yorke Peninsula, South Australia. It is 160 km north of Adelaide.  Wallaroo is a major port for export of grain.  Kalori is celebrating 140 years of education on the 27 – 29th March.  There are 123 students at present with 24 staff members, 12 of them teachers.]
 
 At ~10:10am, all crewmembers, including SFP Simonyi, gathered in Node-2 “Harmony” for the “traditional” live televised 30-min Joint Crew News conference, with US media gathered at NASA Centers  (20 media) and in Tokyo (10).
 
 At ~1:45pm, Gennady, Koichi and Col Mike supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking two messages of greetings, one to congratulate Viktor Antonovich Sadovnichy, the Rector of Moscow State University, on his 70th birthday, the other to greet the participants of a celebration hosted by Roskosmos on April 10 in honor of Space Day and the 75th birthday of Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin at the Russian Army Theater.
 
 CEO photo targets uplinked for today were Southwest Algeria Megafans (ISS had a midday pass in clear weather with most of this large target area to the right of track.  Of primary interest is a large [320 km radius] megafan complex in southwestern Algeria.  These megafans [or inland deltas] have been laid down by rivers that used to flow west and northwest out of the Adrar N'Ahnet Mountains in SW Algeria, and have been proposed as analogs for similar features observed on Mars.  Looking for linear dune fields and highly contorted rocks as landscape markers.  Overlapping mapping frames, looking right of track, were requested), Plum Island Ecosystem, Massachusetts (ISS had a midday pass and a nadir view of this LTER [Long Term Ecological Research Site] situated on the northeast coast of Massachusetts.  Weather will be deteriorating from the west today, but fair weather should hold until the time of your pass.  Plum Island is a barrier island some 30 to 40 miles northeast of Boston.  As ISS approached the New England coast from the SW, with Boston to the right, the crew was to try for a nadir mapping of the island and the interior wetlands and estuaries it protects, using the long lens settings for detail), Madrean Sky Islands (ISS had a nadir pass over the northwestern part of this target area with good views of the “sky island” mountain ranges of southeastern Arizona at midday under fair skies.  Specifically requested were detailed mapping views of the Dragoon, Dos Cabezas, and Chiricahua Mountains), and Jarvis Island, equatorial Pacific (this unusual, trapezoid-shaped island is located just south of the equator about halfway between Hawaii and the Cook Islands.  It is low-lying, uninhabited, has very little vegetation and is just about 2 miles long and 1 mile wide.  CEO is supporting international efforts to document and monitor the Earth’s coral reef systems.  On this late morning pass, the crew was to look just right of track for this target, then use the long lens settings for detailed views of the fringing coral reefs, especially those on the eastern side).
