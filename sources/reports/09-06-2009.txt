ISS On-Orbit Status 09/06/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Flight Day 10 of STS-128/17A.  Sunday --- half-day off duty for both crews.  Ahead: Week 15 of Increment 20
 
  Today’s sleep/wake cycle for the crew: Sleep – 3:00am; wake – 11:30pm; sleep tomorrow – 3:00am.
 
 Mission 17A’s EVA-3 was completed successfully last night by EV1 Danny Olivas &amp; EV2 Christer Fuglesang in 7h 1m, accomplishing all its objectives, one of them incompletely.  Beginning yesterday at 4:39pm EDT, the spacewalk ended at 11:40pm.    [EV1 &amp; EV2 began their “campout” yesterday morning at ~2:25am in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the  Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe at ~2:25am-3:30am.  Later in the day, following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Olivas &amp; Fuglesang at ~12:35pm-1:44pm after spending the “night” on 10.2 psi, the A/L hatch was closed again by Hernandez &amp; Kopra for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge (~3:20pm) and prebreathe in the EMUs (~3:29pm).  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-1 began at 4:39pm.  The excursion lasted 7h 1m.]
 
  During EVA-3, Olivas &amp; Fuglesang –

 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2;text-autospace:none">The      crew was unable to connect one of the Node-3 avionics cable channel      connectors (J181, for CH1/4).  EV2 Fuglesang applied an insulating sleeve      to it.  Ground teams will review imagery and develop a forward plan      (connection is not required until Mission 20A).  </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2;text-autospace:none">Also,      during the EVA, Christer’s EHIP (EVA Helmet Interchangeable      Portable) light bracket/WVS (Wireless Video System) camera assembly came      loose.  Danny assisted in removing it, and it was brought inside for      evaluation.</li> </ul> 
  All intravehicular tasks previewed here yesterday (09/05) were completed.  In particular –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2;text-autospace:      none">FE-2 Kopra &amp; FE-4 Thirsk successfully      replaced the failed powered bolt 4-1 of the ACBM (Active Common Berthing      Mechanism) in the Node-2 nadir vestibule, along with its PCBM (Passive      CBM) nut on the MPLM.  After Thirsk      later in the day re-installed the CBM CPA-4 (Controller Panel Assembly      4), the bolt was successfully checked out by the ground.  The MPLM is now      in a good configuration for unberthing from the ISS; and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level1 lfo2;text-autospace:none">FE-1      Barratt &amp; FE-5 De Winne performed a successful R&amp;R on the OGA      (Oxygen Generator Assembly) Water ORU (Orbital Replacement Unit)’s      inlet screen.  Upon examining the filter using backlighting and      magnification, they estimated that the filter was between 70 &amp; 80%      occluded.  The filter was replaced with a spare and the ORU reassembled.</li> </ul> 
  As a special task today, FE-4 Thirsk is scheduled to provide PCBM MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) verification, i.e., ensuring that the PCBM ring thermal blanket is firmly attached to MPLM structure and is clear of CBM hardware interfaces (i.e., tucked behind capture fittings). 
 
  Today, Nicole Stott is doing the “dry” session part of the biomed experiment INTEGRATED IMMUNE, collecting dry saliva samples throughout the day.  The collections are timelined as a five-minute activity in post sleep but actually consist of five-one minute activities to be collected throughout the day.  All samples are being stored at ambient temperature.      [Along with NUTRITION (Nutritional Status Assessment), INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmember soak a piece of cotton inside their mouth and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned on the Shuttle so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
  Barratt collected a water sample from the Auxiliary Port of the WRS WPA PWD (Water Recovery System / Water Process Assembly / Potable Water Dispenser), then flushed the system.  Afterwards, Mike also collected six samples of WPA EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) water for ground testing for compatibility with EMU sublimators.
 
  The FE-1 &amp; FE-5 De Winne, along with the entire Shuttle crew, are timelined to complete MPLM cargo transfers.
  Status of completion as of end-FD9:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Middeck – 77%</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">MPLM – 87%</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Overall completed: 85%, on      schedule.</li> </ul> 
  Afterwards, Barratt &amp; Thirsk are scheduled to work in “Leonardo”, configuring and preparing the MPLM stowage racks for the Shuttle re-entry on 9/10.
 
  During these activities, the FE-4 will “scavenge” more LHAs (Lamp Housing Assemblies, “light bulbs”) from the MPLM and transfer them to the ISS as spares.
 
  FD10 Midday Break (“lunch”) is timelined tonight at 6:30pm-7:30pm.
 
  CDR Padalka &amp; FE-3 Romanenko have several hours set aside to perform the regular weekly task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  Afterwards, the CDR will undertake the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.  
 
  Gennady is also to check up on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP-Moscow.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Tim Kopra &amp; Nicole Stott, who will take the former’s place as FE-2 after STS-128 departure, have another hour between them for more handover activities.  
 
  An additional handover task for Tim and Nicole is a joint review of using the TVIS-1 treadmill as an exercise device.  
 
  Afterwards, Stott installs &amp; inspects the TVIS SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices) tailored for her and conducts her first exercise session on the treadmill.    [The protective SPDs are required for new crewmembers for the first seven TVIS sessions.]
 
  Bob Thirsk is slated to work with Roman Romanenko in the COL to initiate, deploy &amp; photograph RaDI-N SBDs (Radiation Dosimetry inside ISS / Space Bubble Detectors) near the US TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly for a RaDI-N payload session, measuring neutron flux.    [The SBDs are also part of the Russian RBO-3-2 Matryoshka payload, and Bob will draw on the experience of Roman and TsUP/Moscow in their proper deployment in COL.]
 
  Later, the Canadian flight engineer will disassemble the EVA configuration of the D2Xs digital cameras of their thermal protection and ready then for nominal on-board use.
 
  FE-3 Romanenko is conducting a checkout procedure on the Russian KL-103-Ts onboard television system, with several checkpoints during the day.
 
  Frank &amp; Nicole have time set aside to review and prepare for the planned SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) grappling of the Lab PDGF and its triple walkoff which will set the robot arm up for HTV arrival &amp; berthing.
 
  FE-2-20 Stott will also act as the Operator for the new Spinal Elongation experiment, configuring the equipment and downlinking a situational photograph for the ground to verify before data collection begins.  CDR Sturckow, MS1 Forrester &amp; MS4 Fuglesang are the subjects for the subsequent measurements.    [Afterwards, the payload kit will be re-stowed back on ISS.]
 
  Later, Nicole is to transfer DCBs (Double Cold Bags) with biomedical &amp; microbial samples from the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer on ISS) to the Shuttle-based GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator), after first familiarizing herself with the activity by transferring a “dummy sample” (instructional material).
 
  Barratt, Kopra, Thirsk, De Winne &amp; Padalka were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Frank at ~12:00am, Gennady at ~1:15pm, Mike at ~4:20pm, Timothy at ~9:25pm, Bob at ~10:55pm EDT.
 
  At ~1:55pm, Tim Kopra &amp; Danny Olivas joined in a TV PAO interview exchange with TV stations KFOX-TV in El Paso, TX &amp; KXAN-TV in Austin, TX, and with the Military Times.
 
  Tomorrow morning at ~1:20am, Christer Fuglesang &amp; Frank De Winne will support a 20-min TV PAO downlink event arranged by ESA at Sweden’s SVT Studios in Stockholm, Sweden.    [Expected to attend on the ground are ESA Astronaut Jean Francois Clervoy, SVT Moderator Lotta Bouvain, Sweden’s Minister for Education Jan Björklund, American-Finnish journalist &amp; talk show host Mark Levengood and Swedish opera singer Malena Ernman.]
 
  The ISS crew are performing their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-2, FE-2-20 FE-3, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).
 
  Afterwards, Frank De Winne transfers the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
 Buzz Lightyear Video:    After yesterday’s completed “EVA” episode, Mike Barratt &amp; Tim Kopra will be filming some more hi-def scenes for the video of the “Buzz Lightyear” doll, today for a “Gravity” episode (Astronaut goes to sleep with Buzz doll, releases Buzz, and doll floats away and hits wall) and a “Launch” episode (Buzz flies across screen followed by astronaut, is seen floating or tethered in different locations w/astronauts at work, etc.).  The video is part of the ISS National Lab Office partnership with Disney/Pixar.  It will be used in educational and outreach videos produced by Pixar, with a “Toy Story” movie spin, to stimulate young children's interest in NASA and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education.  Great stuff!
 
  Sleeptime for the crews will begin tomorrow morning at 3:00am, to last until 11:30pm.
