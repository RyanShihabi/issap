ISS On-Orbit Status 04/19/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Progress M-14M/46P undocked this morning successfully at 7:04am EDT from the DC1 Docking Compartment.  After several days of Radar-Progress experiments, sounding the ionospheric environment as modified by thruster firings, the cargo ship will deorbit itself on 4/28 at ~9:46am EDT.</li></ul> 
After the undocking, FE-2 Ivanishin used the NIKON D3X photo camera with f80-400 lens to take photographs of the 46P SSVP docking assembly from SM window #7 to verify that there were no missing or damaged O-ring seals on the Progress docking interface which may have left pieces on the DC-1 port.
 
Also post-undocking, FE-4 Kononenko manually close the KVD/PEV (Pressure Equalization Valve) between the DC1 “Pirs” Docking Module and its docking port vestibule.
 
After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
Upon wakeup, FE-6 Kuipers completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, his 35<sup>th</sup>.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Afterwards, Kuipers began his 4<sup>th</sup> (FD120) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording his diet input today, André will begin the urine collections for pH value on Sunday (4/22) and blood sampling on Monday (4/23).      [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day (science sessions are often referred to by Flight Day 15, 30, 60, etc.  However, there are plus/minus windows associated with these time points so a “Flight Day 15” science session may not actually fall on the crewmember’s 15<sup>th</sup> day on-orbit).  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  On Days 4 &amp; 5, urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
During Postsleep, FE-5 Pettit had blood samples drawn by CDR Burbank for the CSA (Canadian Space Agency) Vascular Blood Collection protocol, his first.  Don then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the coagulated samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1), after recording the blood tube bar codes.      [Led by the Canadian University of Waterloo’s Dr. Richard Hughson, VASCULAR is studying the long-term effects of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system.  Previous medical tests have shown that astronauts who live and work in space for long periods of time experience changes in their blood vessels that are like the aging on Earth.  But in space these changes happen in months instead of years and decades.  The blood vessels become stiffer and lose their elasticity. This can change blood pressure and affect blood flow to vital organs such as the brain and kidney.  Six international astronauts are taking part in VASCULAR, each staying about 6 months on the station.  Their blood samples will be returned to Dr. Hughson’s laboratory for measurements of unique protein and hormone markers that could accelerate vascular aging.  The results of VASCULAR will offer a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of cardiovascular changes during long-duration space missions.  The findings can also help people who suffer from premature cardiovascular aging right now back home on Earth.]
 
Afterwards, Pettit conducted Day 2 activities with Robonaut, first reviewing procedures &amp; instructional video and setting up the Node-2 camcorder for coverage, then powering on Robonaut and supporting ground-commanded activities which checked out waist &amp; arm motions.  Afterwards, Don manually rotated the device to face the deck and at the end deactivated and disassembled it.
 
CDR Burbank opened the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola &amp; JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows which he had closed earlier this morning for the undocking.  Dan also turned the ISS amateur/ham radio equipment on again.
 
Also after the undocking, Dan supported POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center)/Huntsville on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) by uninstalling &amp; removing the three protective alignment guides from the rack, re-engaging the snubber pins and locking the safety pins to allow the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be active before begin of ground-commanded CIR operations requiring a microgravity environment. 
 
Next, the CDR had ~2 hrs for ATV-3 cargo transfer operations, unpacking delivered cargo into ISS stowage locations and cleaning up empty bags, i.e., returning unneeded bags and packing foam to the ATV “Edoardo Amaldi” for disposal.
 
Later, Burbank terminated the maintenance discharge/recharge process on the 2<sup>nd</sup> set of EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) batteries in the A/L BSA (Airlock Battery Stowage Assembly) and initiated it on the 3<sup>rd</sup> set.
 
FE-1 Shkaplerov &amp; FE-2 Ivanishin performed their 2<sup>nd</sup> session each with the MBI-29 IMMUNO (Neuroendocrine &amp; Immune Responses in Humans During &amp; After Long Term Stay at ISS) equipment, using the SALIVA-I IMMUNO kit and the Plazma-03 Centrifuge to collect saliva and, with each other’s help, venous blood samples which were then processed in the centrifuge and stored by André Kuipers in MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) for return to Earth on Soyuz 28S.  Later, the two crewmembers conducted the MBI-29 stress test and filled out the associated questionnaire.
 
In preparation for Progress M-15M/47P (#415) docking at the DC1 port on 4/22 (next Sunday, ~10:40am EDT), Shkaplerov &amp; Kononenko worked through the standard 3-hr refresher training for the TORU teleoperator system, which provides a manual backup mode to the Progress’ KURS automated rendezvous radar system.       [The drill included procedure review, rendezvous, docking data and rendezvous math modeling data review, fly-around, final approach, docking and off-nominal situations (e.g., video or comm loss).  Three different flight conditions were simulated on the RSK1 laptop.  The TORU teleoperator control system lets a SM-based crewmember perform the approach and docking of automated Progress vehicles in case of KURS failure.  During spacecraft approach, TORU is in “hot standby” mode.  Receiving a video image of the approaching ISS, as seen from a Progress-mounted docking television camera (“Klest”), on a color monitor (“Simvol-Ts”, i.e. “symbol center”) which also displays an overlay of rendezvous data from the onboard digital computer, the crewmember would steer the Progress to mechanical contact by means of two hand controllers, one for rotation (RUO), the other for translation (RUD), on adjustable armrests.  The controller-generated commands are transmitted from the SM's TORU control panel to the Progress via VHF radio.  In addition to the Simvol-Ts color monitor, range, range rate (approach velocity) and relative angular position data are displayed on the “Klest-M” video monitor (VKU) which starts picking up signals from Progress when it is still approximately 9 km away.  TORU is monitored in real time from TsUP over RGS (Russian Ground Sites) and via Ku-band from Houston, but its control cannot be taken over from the ground.]
 
Anatoly Ivanishin meanwhile configured the equipment for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h 15m session, his 4<sup>th</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure+.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
At ~12:45pm EDT, Dan Burbank concluded his 5<sup>th</sup> (R-15) ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, doffing the two Actiwatches and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) about 24 hrs after the end of yesterday’s “midpoint” activity (~10:15am), then powered on the laptop and downloaded the data from the two Actiwatch Spectrums, copied the data from the 2 HM2 HiFi CF Cards to the HRF PC and downloaded Cardiopres data.         [For the ICV Ambulatory Monitoring session, during the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres/BP is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours, with the Makita batteries switched as required.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.]
 
In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), after powering on the PFM/PAM (Pulmonary Function Module/Photoacoustic Analyzer Module) and initiating PFM/PAM warm-up for CARD rebreathe exercises, FE-5 Kuipers completed Day 2 of the ESA cardiological experiment CARD (Long Term Microgravity: A Model for Investigating Mechanisms of Heart Disease).       [This included closing out the 24-hr urine collection protocol, performing the fourth &amp; fifth rebreathing sessions and completing the blood draw in two tubes which were then centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge).  Afterwards, André stowed the PFS (Pulmonary Function System), saved all the HLTA BP (Holter Arterial Blood Pressure) data on a PCMCIA memory card and reconnected the MPPL (Multi Purpose Payload Laptop) to its 120VDC outlet.  After the second centrifugation, the two tubes were placed into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Degree Laboratory Freezer for the ISS) at -80 degC.  CARD includes three double rebreathing sessions yesterday plus two double rebreathings today.  Between these two rebreathings, the CDL HTA was activated to take BP measurements.  CARD was performed for the first time by ESA crewmember Thomas Reiter in November 2006.  Astronauts experience lowered blood volume and pressure during space missions due to relaxation of the cardiovascular system in microgravity which may be a result from decreased fluid and sodium in the body.  CARD examines the relationship between salt intake and the cardiovascular system when exposed to the microgravity environment and explores whether blood pressure &amp; volume can be restored to the same levels that were measured during groundbased measurements by adding additional salt to the crew’s food.  Results from this may lead to new health safety measures for astronauts to protect them on long duration missions.]
 
In Node-3, FE-6 Pettit completed the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 16 min, a partial fill during which WHC was not available,
 
In the US Lab, working with the ground, FE-6 powered on the SAMS ICU (Space Acceleration Measurement System Interim Control Unit), located in ER1 (EXPRESS Rack 1) Drawer 2.
 
Don also tended to the JAXA SSHDT (Super Sensitive High Definition TV), transferring it from the JPM to the Node-3/Cupola for taking zoom lens video of night views of Japan.       [About 4 hrs later, André exchanged the 32GB memory card and the lens, then restarted the recording (once a day).  SSHDTV was then dismantled and returned to Kibo.]
 
On JAXA request, Dan Burbank retrieved a failed CsPINs (Dynamism of Auxin Efflux Facilitators responsible for Gravity-regulated Growth &amp; Development in Cucumber) KFT (KSC Fixation Tube) from a jettison stowage bag and stowed it instead in a CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag) designated for future return.       [In Inc-28, several KFT activation failures were encountered during the second series of CsPINs experiment.  Since then, SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center/Tsukuba) has attempted to find the root cause and prepared a procedure to prevent the failure from happening again, but KFT activation failed again during the recent CsPINs familiarization session on 4/5.  SSIPC then decided to return the failed KFT for further investigation since the solution in the failed tube was Glutaraldehyde Paraformaldehyde which was different from the previous fixative Acetic Acid Ethanol.]
 
Anton Shkaplerov collected &amp; downloaded the periodic sensor readings of the Russian “Pille-MKS” (MKS = ISS) radiation dosimetry experiment which has 11 sensors placed at various locations in the RS (DC1, SM starboard &amp; port cabin windows, ASU toilet facility, control panel, MRM2, MRM1, etc.) and four in CQs.        [The memory/flash card was then replaced.  Today’s readings were taken manually from all 11 deployed dosimeters and logged on a data sheet.  The dosimeters take their readings automatically every 90 minutes.]

Oleg Kononenko completed the periodic (~monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new spare.  The old unit was discarded as trash and the IMS updated.       [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
Later, FE-4 conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)�CRO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)�CRO, PkhO�CDC1, PkhO�CFGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO�CFGB GA, and FGB GA�CNode-1.]
 
Oleg also performed the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of cooling loop KOB-2, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness).
 
Kuipers repressurized the ISS atmosphere with air from ATV-3 stores, raising total cabin pressure from ~746 mmHg to ~756 mmHg.
 
Next, André conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card  (29-0008S) lists 18 CWCs (223.47 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (2 CWCs with 65.5 L, for Elektron electrolysis, plus 1 empty bag, all containing Wautersia bacteria;  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (7 CWCs with 121.8 L;  4. Waste water (1 bag with 13.67 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 empty CWC). Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5L).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
Afterwards, FE-5 disconnected the DCP (Display &amp; Control Panel) bypass cable of the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation), used yesterday during the SpaceX Dragon simulation drill.
 
In preparation for Progress 47P arrival on 4/22, Oleg set up the Ku-band video “scheme” for a 40-min communications test of converting the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera to U.S. NTSC format and Ku-band from SM &amp; Node-3/Cupola, for downlinking as MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoded “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.         [Steps included connecting the SM TVS (television system) to the T61p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop at the SM CP (Central Post), activating Soyuz TVS, turning on MPEG-2 video Server 2, and monitoring the SM’s TV signal from the ground (Moscow) via Ku-band and the Cupola RWS.  The analog signal version of the digital Ku-band downlink is sent to TsUP-Moscow via ESA Gateway at COL-CC (Columbus Orbital Laboratory Control Center) on a Tandberg Decoder.]
 
During the MPEG2 multicasting test, applications on wireless SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops in use had to be switched to wired SSCs.  Afterwards, Don Pettit reconfigured the SSCs to their nominal wireless setting.      [Since network video streaming slows down applications on laptops connected to WAPs (Wireless Access Points), any used wireless SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops must be switched beforehand to wired SSCs and later restored to nominal.] 
 
Ivanishin took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Shkaplerov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Kononenko performed the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS treadmill.    [This is primarily an inspection of the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.]
 
Oleg also completed his 8<sup>th</sup> data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Anton &amp; Anatoly again had an hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
André conducted the visual T+2 Days (44 ± 4h) microbial (bacterial &amp; fungal) analysis of PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) water samples collected by him on 4/17 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient &amp; Hot ports, using the WMK MCD (Water Microbiology Kit / Microbial Capture Devices) for microbial traces, and the CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for inflight coliform indications (Magenta for Positive, Yellow for Negative).
 
Later, FE-5 completed his weekly task of filling out his SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space.
 
At ~4:15am EDT, Shkaplerov, Ivanishin &amp; Kononenko engaged in the monthly PAO phone interview via S-band with Ekaterina Beloglazova, Editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos (Russian Space) Magazine and an old friend of ISS cosmonauts.      [“Did you have a chance to sit in the modified Chibis-M?  How is it different from the old one? How efficient and comfortable is it? -How can you assess your work on the station? What are your thoughts? You have a little bit over a week of stay in weightlessness. It is going to be a very busy one. - Too bad that you won’t see Dragon. However, you will see one Progress off and welcome another one. What will it be delivering to the station? - And Oleg will become a crew commander and see the first US commercial vehicle. Please tell us about your plans for the next month.- What do you think about video footage for children’s Karusel channel? Do we need these shows? - We enjoy your good snapshots all the time. Did you have anything unusual, amazing happening in this time frame?”]
 
At ~12:50pm, Don Pettit powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 1:00pm conducted a ham radio session with students at Flabob Airport Preparatory Academy, Riverside, CA.
 
At ~1:45pm, Dan &amp; Don conducted the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
Before Presleep, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Dan turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.] 
 
Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko &amp; Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were �C<a name="_GoBack"></a>
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>A ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, focusing on Hong Kong, Russian Island, Krasnaya Polyana, Kolka Glacier, Terek River, Volga River delta, Caspian Sea drilling platforms, Darwin Island, and the Volcanoes Hudson, Aetna, Stromboli, Huascaran, Arenal, Poas &amp; San Cristobal;
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and

CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Dhaka, Bangladesh (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION.  This megacity of 16.6 million lies to the east of the combined Ganges-Brahmaputra waterway and just above the Ganges delta.  These waterways are major visual cues compared with the city.  At this time, partly cloudy conditions may have been present, but crew was to begin looking just right of track views of this capital city in a single frame), Pretoria, South Africa (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  The administrative capital of South Africa is located in the northeastern part of the country within a series of ridges about 35 miles north of the major city of Johannesburg.  ISS had a midday pass in fair weather with approach from the SW.  At this time, after passing the much larger urban area of Johannesburg, the crew was to look near nadir for this city of about 600,000, trying for single-frame views of the urban area), and Bissau, Guinea-Bissau (CAPITAL CITIES COLLECTION:  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass for this target with fair weather but the possibility of dust in the atmosphere.  This capital city of nearly half a million is located in an extremely low-lying wetlands area on the north shore of the Geba River estuary as it empties southwestward into the Atlantic Ocean.  At this time as ISS approached the coast from the SW, the crew was to aim near nadir for views of the urban area within a single frame).
