Fine Motor Skills (FMS): Kelly and Kornienko performed their Flight Day 60 FMS sessions this morning.  In the Fine Motor Skills experiment, crew members perform a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet. Fine motor skills are crucial for successfully interacting with touch-based technologies, repairing sensitive equipment, and a variety of other tasks. In Fine Motor Skills, crew members perform a series of interactive tasks on a touchscreen tablet. The investigation is the first fine motor skills study to measure long-term microgravity exposure, different phases of microgravity adaptation, and sensorimotor recovery after returning to Earth gravity. 
Handhold Experiment Platform (HXP) Installation: Today, the JEM Airlock outer hatch was opened and slide table extended for the Small Fine Arm (SFA) to grapple the HXP and install on one of the handrails of the JEM Exposed Facility (JEF).  The HXP is composed of several exposure experiments which will remain attached to the JEF for approximately one year, collecting data on material interactions to long duration space exposure.
Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) Relocation Preparation:  In support of tomorrow’s PMM relocation, the crew installed the Centerline Berthing Camera System (CBCS) on Node 3 Forward hatch this morning.  Later, they configured PMM for egress by deactivating lights, closed Node 1 Remotely Actuated Motorized Valve (RAMV), removed Inter-module Ventilation (IMV) and remaining power and data jumpers, then closed the PMM hatch.  Once the PMM hatch was closed, the crew performed Node 1 Nadir CBM Control Panel Assembly (CPA) installation, connected Node 1 bulkhead feedthrough power cable, installed the Center Disk Cover, closed Node 1 Nadir Hatch, and depressurized the vestibule. PMM relocation from Node 1 Nadir to Node 3 Forward is planned for tomorrow morning starting at approximately 4:30 am CDT.
