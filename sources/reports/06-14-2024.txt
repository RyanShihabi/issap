Boeing CST-100 Crewed Flight Test (CFT): Today, the CFT crew completed a CFT Crew Conference, a CST-100 Piloting Assessment, and a CST-100 Life Raft Assessment as part of the ongoing CST testing being conducted.
Payloads:
Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4): The crew connected the USB hard drive to the PK-4 unit. PK-4 looks at complex or “dusty” plasmas, in which small particles are suspended and form patterns in ionized gas.  More information on PK-4 can be found here.
Systems:
Health Maintenance System (HMS) Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT2) Exam: The crew completed routine OCT eye exams. OCT is an imaging technique analogous to ultrasound imaging that uses light instead of sound to capture micrometer-resolution, two- and three-dimensional images of tissue; in this case, the objects of interest are the crewmembers’ eyes. Eye exams are performed regularly on-board to monitor crewmembers’ eye health. Eyesight is one of the many aspects of the human body that may be affected by long-duration stays in a microgravity environment.
