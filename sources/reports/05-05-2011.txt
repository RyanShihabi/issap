ISS On-Orbit Status 05/05/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
 
Upon wake-up, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator.      [Maxim Suraev installed these filters on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Alexandr inspects the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 8<sup>th</sup> for Ron, the 31<sup>st</sup> for Paolo &amp; Cady.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
CDR Kondratyev configured the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 5<sup>th</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
FE-2 Borisenko took his first MBI-24 “SPRUT-2” (“Squid-2”) test, part of Russian medical research on the distribution and behavior of human body fluids in zero gravity, along with PZEh-MO-8 body mass measurement using the IM device.  Sasha shot documentary photography.       [Supported by the RSE-Med A31p laptop with new software (Vers. 1.6) in the SM (Service Module), the test uses the Profilaktika kit, with data recorded on PCMCIA memory cards, along with the crewmember’s body mass values and earlier recorded MO-10 Hematocrit value, but skipping “fat fold” measurements.  Experiment requisites are the Sprut securing harness, skin electrodes (cuffs), and RSS-Med for control and data storage.  The “Pinguin” suit or Braslet-M cuffs, if worn, have to be taken off first.  Electrode measurements are recorded at complete rest and relaxed body position.  The actual recording takes 3-5 minutes, during which the patient has to remain at complete rest.]
 
FE-5 Nespoli spent the better part of his workday in Node-2 installing brackets and fittings on racks and standoffs.      [After Flight 17A the Node-2 rack bays were reconfigured to stay out of the sway space required for T2/treadmill operations at location D5.  Now that T2 has been relocated to Node-3, today’s procedure placed the 4 Node-2 rack bays back on K-BARS (Knee-Brace Assembly Replacements) and Pivot Fittings to support quicker and easier rack rotations.  The Node-2 ELPS-2 (Emergency Lighting Power Supply 2) was also removed, making the EEGS (Emergency Egress Guidance System) the primary egress path marker in Node-2.  The task came in three parts: 1. Gathering equipment; 2. Installing brackets and closing out; 3. Configuring rack hardware at D5 for Ron Garan’s CQ (Crew Quarters).] 
 
Nespoli also started his 3<sup>rd</sup> session (of 3 total) with the JAXA experiment “Biological Rhythms” (BIORHYTHMS), for which he donned the electrodes of the DWH (Digital Walk Holter) for ECG (electrocardiogram) recording, then initiated the data take for the next 24 hrs.
 
Working on the ELT (Experiment Laptop Terminal) in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-6 downloaded and saved the ECG (electrocardiogram) data recorded for the last 24 hrs from her 3<sup>rd</sup> session (of 3 total) with the BIORHYTHMS experiment, for which she yesterday had donned the DWH electrodes for ECG recording.
 
FE-6 Coleman conducted the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and making sure that the TOCA water sample hose was primed (filled).      [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, Ron Garan transferred the results to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and also logged the data.]
 
Afterwards, Cady Coleman started her 4<sup>th </sup>(FD135) and final 24-hr Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment, with ECG (electrocardiogram) Holter and Actiwatches (no Cardiopres blood pressure monitoring this time).  Paolo Nespoli assisted as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) in preparing the Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness &amp; donning the Cardiopres.      [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist &amp; ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Cady started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  The nominal exercise, preferably on the CEVIS cycle ergometer, includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan includes an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.]
 
Cady also set up the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware including MBS (Mixing Bag System) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), and then conducted her 5<sup>th</sup> and final session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, integrated with Thermolab.  Afterwards, FE-6 powered down, cleaned up and temporarily stowed the equipment, then downloaded the data to a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop.  Later, Cady consolidated the VO<sub>2</sub>max kits, replacing old &amp; expired items with new ones.       [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
Paolo Nespoli unstowed and prepared the equipment for his 5<sup>th</sup> (FD180) and final suite of sessions with the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  After recording his diet input today &amp; tomorrow, Paolo will begin the urine collections for pH value on Sunday (5/8) and blood sampling on Monday (5/9).      [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.]
 
After reviewing procedures and setting up the video equipment in the Lab for a live ground view of his activities, FE-3 Garan serviced the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to support continuation of CIR MDCA (Multi-user Drop Combustion Apparatus) test point activities.        [Ron first opened the FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility) upper door, removed &amp; replaced the MDCA Fuel Reservoir in Location 1, replaced a manifold bottle on one of four manifolds in front of the Optics Bench (#2010, with 40% O<sub>2</sub>, 20% CO<sub>2</sub>, 40% N<sub>2</sub>and 293 psia pressure) with another bottle (#2011, with 40% O<sub>2</sub>, 20% CO<sub>2</sub>, 40% N<sub>2</sub>), then placed the GIP valve lever in down (vent) position), closed the manifold bottle valves and relieved pressure on all four CIR manifolds to prepare for FOMA (Fuel/Oxidizer Management Assembly) calibration, then closing the FCF upper rack door and notifying POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) of payload readiness.] 
 
CDR Kondratyev, with FE-1 Samokutyayev assisting as handover, performed the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA.
 
Afterwards, Dmitri and Sasha conducted routine preventive maintenance on the SM Rodnik water storage system, opening and closing the KN water &amp; KV pressurization valves from the Rodnik control panel.     [The procedure of activating each valve twice is intended to keep the valves functional during long-term water storage.],
 
Later, the CDR had several hours to continue the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the SM to clean the VT1, VTK1, VT2 &amp; VTK2 fan screens, after taking photographs showing their before-condition.
 
Dmitri also completed the regular transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWCs #1079 to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, then filling the designated KOV EDV container.      [Once filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.  The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.]
 
Andrey Borisenko again had 2.5 hrs set aside for cargo unloading &amp; transfer operations from Progress M-10M/42P, logging moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System).
 
Samokutyayev completed another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with SIGMA AF 300-800mm telephotolens.      [Today’s target:  Kolka glacier on the northern slope of Kazbek volcano, Terek River, oil slicks on the surface of the Caspian Sea, Katun Range, and ice conditions on Lake Baikal.]
 
Afterwards, Sasha continued the periodic (~annual) extensive audit/inventory of the SUBA SD1-7 &amp; SSD305 lighting fixtures in the RS including portables, started yesterday, for the purpose of assessing lighting in the RS, planning delivery of replacements, and updating the IMS (Inventory Management System) on the ground.     [Going by an uplinked listing of 54 lights fixtures in SM (Service Module, 26), FGB (12), DC1 (5), MRM1 (7), MRM2 (3) &amp; 42P (1), Sasha checked functionality of the lights, replaced failed units where necessary and also inventoried the supply of spares in 6 bags.  The resulting data files were downlinked to TsUP-Moscow via OCA.]
 
FE-1 also supported the BTKh-14 BIOEMULSIYA (Bioemulsion) science payload in its bioreactor #6.  FE-2 took documentary photography.     [Sasha first set up the GB/Glavboks-S (Glovebox-S) for sterilization for about an hour, then transferred the bioreactor from Kriogem-03 (+4 degC) to the GB for reloading and letting it cultivate in the KT container (+37 degC) for the next 18 hrs.  GB was cleaned up and closed out.  The Bioemulsion experiment is attempting to develop faster technologies for obtaining microorganism biomass and biologically active substance biomass for creating highly efficient environmentally pure bacteria, enzymes, and medicinal/pharmaceutical preparations.]
 
FE-3 Garan performed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (27-0041F) lists 116 CWCs (2,261.0 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (12 CWCs with 458.5 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 153.5 L in 5 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (91 CWCs with 1,668.3 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (101.6 L in 11 bags incl. 5 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (32.8 L in 2 CWCs from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
Next, Ron used the LFTP (Low Flow Transfer Pump) to transfer ULF5/Shuttle condensate from a leaky CWC-I (Iodinated, in a Ziploc bag) to the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly / Waste Water Tank) for processing.     [Estimated offload time: 5h 20m.]
 
FE-5 Nespoli gathered hardware items for the upcoming installation of the new ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera), a successor of the earlier AgCam, stowing the temporarily in the Lab near bay D3.     [ISSAC will be operational along with EarthKAM, both to conduct simultaneous but independent operations in the relatively new WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack in the Lab.  AgCam was a multi-spectral camera for taking images, in visible and infrared light, of vegetated areas on the Earth, principally of growing crops, rangeland, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  It was found to have operational problems and was discontinued in 2009.]
 
Paolo also performed regular maintenance calibration on the sensors of the two CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units #1045 &amp; #1046.
 
Ron filled out his 4<sup>th</sup> weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).       [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
Borisenko took care of the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Kondratyev conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Later tonight before “Presleep” period, Cady will power on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
At ~6:00am EDT, Dmitri, Sasha &amp; Andrey joined for a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking a message of greetings to (1) Controls and Radio Electronics Systems of Tomsk State University (TUSUR), and (2) the representatives of Diplomatic Missions.     [(1) In the city of Tomsk, Radio Day celebrations started with the opening of Tomsk Institute of Radio and Electronics Engineering, TIRiET (currently TUSUR) school of Radio Engineering, which gradually developed from a celebration of professional holiday to one of the main university traditions. Since 1986, on May 7, TURUS students organize annual festive parades through the streets of Tomsk.   In 2001 this holiday became a city-wide event with participation including not just students and TURUS graduates, but students of other Tomsk institutions of higher learning, guests from other places.  (2) On May 11, 2011, the Main Administration for Service to the Diplomatic Corps under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russian, together with Moscow Peace Fund, is hosting a gala event dedicated to the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the first human flight to space.  Among the guests are the heads of diplomatic missions of leading space nations accredited in Moscow, and representatives of countries participating in joint space programs.]
 
At 1:15pm, Cady Coleman &amp; Ron Garan supported a PAO TV downlink, responding to two interview requests, one from Associated Press (Marcia Dunn), the other from the Wall Street Journal (Michael Kofsky).
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-2, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).
 
ISS Reboost Update:   This morning at 7:20am EDT, a one-burn ISS reboost was successfully performed by the ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” with its OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters, for a duration of 4 min 3 sec and a delta-V of 0.6 m/s (1.97 ft/s).  Altitude gain was expected 1.043 km (0.56 nmi).  Purpose of the reboost was to set up phasing for 25S landing on 5/23.
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Asmara, Eritrea (this capital city of nearly 600,000 lies at elevation of 7,628 ft near a great escarpment that marks edge of the Eritrean Highlands with the shores of the Red Sea just 50 miles to the east.  Today ISS had a nadir pass in late morning light with an approach from the SW.  This is a low-contrast target, so as the crew tracked northeastward over the rugged, barren Highlands at this time, they were to begin a nadir-looking mapping pass, ending when they reached the escarpment or the coast), Brussels, Belgium (ISS had a mid-afternoon pass today with a momentary break in the weather for this capital city target.  Brussels with a population of nearly 2 million is located in central Belgium about 70 miles inland from the North Sea.  As ISS tracked eastward and inland at this time, the crew was to aim nadir for this major city), and Wanapitei Impact Crater, Ontario, Canada (this 37 million year old impact is located in southeastern Ontario province about 50 miles north of Georgian Bay [part of Lake Huron].  It is marked by a roughly rounded lake by the same name.  ISS approached this target from the WSW in early afternoon with fair weather expected to hold.  At this time the crew was to look near nadir and conduct a detailed mapping pass of the area of the lake as well as the Sudbury features if possible).
