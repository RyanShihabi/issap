Boeing CST-100 Crewed Flight Test (CFT): The CFT crew performed various maintenance and cargo activities to assist the ISS crew. They completed an activity to help organize the PMM and an activity to remove the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) Pressure Control and Pump Assembly (PCPA) Motor from PCPA SN002 in support of the PCPA Motor Remove & Replace (R&R).
Payloads:
Materials Science Research Rack/Material Science Lab-Sample Cartridge Assembly Batch 3a (MSRR/MSL SCA-Batch-3a): The old Low Gradient Furnace (LGF) sample (CETSOL3 #7) was removed from the Solidification and Quench Furnace (SQF) and the next sample (CETSOL3 #8) was installed. More information on this experiment can be found here.
Systems:
In Flight Maintenance (IFM) PCPA SN002 Motor Removal: This week, in order to ensure a functional PCPA spare exists on-board the ISS, the crew is performing a maintenance procedure to R&R a PCPA motor. Today, the crew removed the motor from PCPA SN002 after removing the PCPA SN007 motor yesterday. Tomorrow, the crew will install the motor from PCPA SN007 into the housing of PCPA SN002. Another spare PCPA is also planned to arrive in August on the Cygnus NG-21 vehicle.
Cargo Operations: Today, the crew completed a variety of cargo and stowage activities on-board the ISS. They performed a PMM Cleanup, a Columbus Starboard Endcone Stowage Audit, and Transfer Cygnus Cargo Operations. These activities allow for more efficient completion of activities on board and prepare the Cygnus NG-20 vehicle for return in July.
EVA Preparation Operations: The crew performed various activities in preparation for the upcoming EVA. The crew completed EVA Helmet Light Install, EVA Tool Configuring, and an EVA Procedure Conference. These activities are in preparation for the upcoming Common Communications for Visiting Vehicle (C2V2), Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), Rate Gyro Assembly (RGA), and DC-DC Converter Unit (DDCU) (CARD) EVA.
