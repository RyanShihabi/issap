ISS On-Orbit Status 01/14/11
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
 FE-1 Kaleri conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Alex will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 After configuring the STTS comm system for working in the MRM2 Poisk research module, FE-1 Kaleri began the day by tending to the current experiment session with the Russian/German KPT-21 Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall/PK-3+) payload, activating the turbopump in the MRM2 module for keeping the vacuum chamber (EB) evacuated.  FE-1 followed up with a ground specialist tagup (~3:10am EST), then initiated the experiment.  Later, the system was disconnected, results downloaded &amp; downlinked and PK-3 deactivated.  FE-2 Skripochka assisted by checking on the downlinked TV signal.     [Main objective of PK-3 is to study wave propagation and dispersion ratio in a dust plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber, at a specified power of HF discharge, pressure, and a varied number of particles.]
 
 At wake-up, CDR Scott Kelly &amp; FE-6 Cady Coleman completed their 6<sup>th</sup> post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  Paolo Nespoli completed his 6<sup>th</sup> RST yesterday.     [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Coleman concluded her second NUTRITION/Repository/Pro K generic blood collection, with Nespoli assisting with the phlebotomy as Operator.  FE-6 then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI.      [The operational products for blood &amp; urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
 Later, Cady also performed her 2<sup>nd</sup> ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Resting Echo Scan as subject, assisted by Nespoli as CMO, helping to operate the ultrasound scans.      [Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable &amp; VOX, Cady underwent the ultrasound scan for the Resting Echo mode of ICV, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera.  First, heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor).  After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed.  Next, Cady performed an ESA Vessel Imaging (Echography) scan in the COL on the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop, using the Image Collector software, with VOX/Voice plus real-time video downlink during the activity.  Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there are fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).]
 
 Later in the day, Coleman prepared the equipment for her next HRF (Human Research Facility) generic 24-hr urine collections, starting on Sunday (1/16).
 
 Kaleri undertook a session with the MedOps protocol MO-5, “Cardiovascular Evaluation during Graded Exercises” on the VELO cycle ergometer, a standard Russian fitness test, assisted by Skripochka as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Afterwards, the two Flight Engineers switched places, with Oleg becoming the subject and Alex the CMO.      [The 50-min assessment (per person), supported by ground specialist tagup via VHF and telemetry monitoring from RGS (Russian Ground Site, 5:17am &amp; 6:51am EST) uses the Gamma-1 ECG (electrocardiograph) equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels.  For the graded exercise, the subject works the pedals after a prescribed program at load settings of 125, 150, and 175 watts for three minutes each.  Data output involves a kinetocardiogram, rheoplethysmogram, rheoencephalogram and a temporal pulsogram.]
 
 CDR Kelly supported the BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) payload in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), by performing the periodic camera setup status check on the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) with Sample 10, without SSC (Station Support Computer).     [The checkup includes image transfer, camera battery and camera/flash position.  It is currently scheduled every other day after Initiation+1 day during automated photography. Pictures are being taken automatically of Sample 10 for 14 days (started on 12/30).]
 
 Afterwards, Scott initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.    [This was the 9<sup>th</sup> session with the newly replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 Guided by the IMS (Inventory Management System), Nespoli relocated food packages from Node-1 stowage to the FGB, where space had been cleared earlier.
 
 Paolo deployed four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.      [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
 Afterwards, FE-5 collected air samples with the GSC (Grab Sample Container) in the center of the SM, Lab and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), using three regular samplers.
 
 Continuing their carefully paced preparations for the EVA-27 spacewalk next week (1/21) and the preceding suited dry-run (1/18), Skripochka &amp; Kondratyev –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Conducted a one-hour procedures review,</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Completed individual fit sizing (central strap, lateral strap, hip strap, calf strap, arm cable and shoulder size, front &amp; rear) on their Orlan-MK spacesuits,</li><li>Adjusted the palm sizing bars of their GP-10KM suit gloves as required,</li><li>Ran leak checks &amp; valve functionality tests on the Orlans and their BSS interface units in the DC1 &amp; SM PkhO from the EVA support panels (POV); and</li><li>Conducted pressure checks on the SM BK-3 O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) tanks and the BNP portable repress O<sub>2</sub> tank in the DC-1 airlock module.</li> </ul> 
 Oleg Skripochka serviced the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet, downloading structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer before undocking to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.     [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.]
 
 FE-6 Coleman &amp; FE-5 Nespoli conducted the 4<sup>th</sup> onboard JAXA HAIR experiment (their first), each one taking hair samples of the other, then inserting them into MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) at -95 degC and closing out the activity.
 
 In Node-2, Kelly removed stowage to free access to the Ovhd 0-01 panel preparatory to the routing of the HTV2 (HTV-II Transfer Vehicle) backup power cabling, stowing the items temporarily per crew preference.  After the cable installation, the stowage was replaced.
 
 Then, Scott &amp; Cady spend more time routing their custom-building cable to support the HTV2 berthing on 1/27.      [The contingency power cable, using scavenged connectors and components from the LGPK (Large Gauge Pin Kit), is needed in the event the HTV2 requires a backup power feed while berthed to the Node-2 Zenith CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism). HTV2 will initially berth to the Node-2 Nadir CBM, but will be relocated to the Node-2 Zenith CBM during the STS-133/ULF5 mission. After the cable was built, its conductivity and insolation was successfully confirmed.] 
 
 Working ~2 hrs in Node-3 on the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System 2) at loc. D4, the CDR removed &amp; replaced the WPA (Water Processing Assembly) separator filter ORU (On-orbit Replaceable Unit) which has reached the end of service life. 
 
 Dmitri set up the usual pumping equipment (Kompressor-M #41, hoses, adapters) in the DC1 and transferred the urine from EDV-U containers to the BV2 Rodnik water storage tank of Progress M-08M/40P (#408), docked at DC1 Nadir.      [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
 CDR Kelly installed &amp; checked out the CBCS (Centerline Berthing Camera System) at the Node-2 Nadir hatch, with its power, video and control unit connections, for HTV2 berthing. 
 
 Alex Kaleri continued the checkout of the PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) for the European ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) in the RS (Russian Segment).    [Activities focused on testing the MBRL, MBRL AFU (Antenna Feeder Unit) and ATV Hand Controller.]
 
 Starting final preparations for the undocking of Progress M-08M/40P on 1/24, FE-1 Kaleri removed two handles from the Progress internal hatch cover.
 
 Afterwards, Alex installed the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC-1 nadir port.     [StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB, DC-1, MRM1 &amp; MRM2.]
 
 Dima Kondratyev took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 After yesterday’s removal of all cables of the EMCS (European Modular Cultivation System) in the COL to allow tilting of ER3 (EXPRESS Rack 3) away from the wall and today setting up the VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) for activity monitoring by the ground, FE-5 Paolo Nespoli accessed the WOOV8 (Water On-Off Valve 8) and worked on it to free the movement of the stuck valve.      [This had already been tried, unsuccessfully, by Tracy Caldwell-Dyson on 9/3/10.  Afterwards, ER3 was rotated back, connected to its cabling (umbilicals for GN2 supply, vacuum exhaust) and the EMCS cables were re-connected.  Documentary photography was then taken of all WOOVs, specifically of the area below the hand wheel, and of any deposits in the area.]
 
 FE-6 Cady Coleman “degassed” another CWC-I (Contingency Water Containers-Iodine, #2003), to remove any free air bubbles that may have been ingested since its last use.  This has become necessary since the water in the bag is reaching its expiration date and needs to be used.     [The traditional procedure for “degassing” the container by first draining, then refilling it with a fully charged water CWC was replaced in 2004 by a rather ingenious new procedure developed and checked out on the KC-135 aircraft flying zero-G parabolas at JSC/Houston: Essentially, it involves the crewmember himself centrifuging the selected container by holding it away from the body and applying a slow rotation of ~15 rpm to himself, to separate air and water in the bag through centrifugal force, while simultaneously squeezing out the air by cinching down on bungee cords wrapped around the CWC.]
 
 Shortly before bedtime, Nespoli will prepare the diet log for his upcoming first six-day SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) session, which entails a series of diet intake loggings, body mass measurements and blood &amp; urine samplings in two session blocks.     [SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
 At ~2:55am EST, the crew held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
 At ~3:20am, Oleg &amp; Dima linked up with TsUP/Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
 At ~1:20pm, Scott had his regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
 At ~2:10pm, the six crewmembers were scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director or ISS at JSC/MCC-Houston.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC water audit.      [The new card (26-0045D lists 116 CWCs (2,399.4 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (24 CWCs with 891.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 519.5 L in 13 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 214.5 L in 7 bags for transfer into EDV-RP containers via US/RSA-B hose, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only; 2. potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (82 CWCs with 1,476.0 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (6.3 L in 1 bag to be used only for OGA, plus 7 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (25.9 L in 2 CWCs from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded today were Wellington, New Zealand (Night Target:  Weather was predicted to be mostly clear.  A review of the database reveals no cataloged imagery of night views of Wellington.  Looking slightly left of track for the capital and third most populous urban area of New Zealand), and Dakar, Senegal (Night Pass:  The coastal cities of western Africa called out in this request should have been mostly clear.  The first city, right of track and along the coast was Dakar, Senegal.  The next city was Bissau, Guinea-Bissau and is the capital city, also slightly right of track.  Bissau was closely followed by Conakry, Guinea.  Freetown followed Conakry.  ISS had a nadir pass over Monrovia, Liberia.  At this point ISS left the African coast and passed over the South Atlantic Ocean.  Before the pass ended and as soon as ISS crossed the southwestern African coast, the crew was to look right of track for Cape Town and left of track for Port Elizabeth, along the southern coast).
