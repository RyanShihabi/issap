ISS On-Orbit Status 04/17/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    FD13 (Flight Day 13) of STS-131/19A.   Saturday – Undock Day.
 
 Crew sleep shifting in effect: Wake 12:21am, sleep 3:21pm, returning to nominal tomorrow: Wake 2:00am, sleep 5:30pm.
 
 ISS and STS-131/Discovery are flying in separate orbits again.    [After the traditional Crew Farewell this morning at ~6:00am EDT and hatch closure at 6:52am EDT, Afterwards, with the Shuttle already controlling attitude of the mated stack with Orbiter ORB control, Rick Mastracchio &amp; Dottie Metcalf-Lindenburger initiated the standard one-hour leak check on the ODS (Orbiter Docking System).  Discovery undocked in darkness (local sunset 8:37am) at 8:52:25am from PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 2).  After separation, PLT Jim Dutton completed a 270-deg station flyaround, and the Orbiter crew obtained photo/video imagery of the ISS.  Final sep burn (Sep 2, 3.0 fps) was at ~10:30am, retrograde.]
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Discovery is expected to      return to Earth on 4/19 (Monday) after its 14-day mission.  Landing      opportunities at KSC are at 8:51:22am (Orbit 222) &amp; 10:26:26am EDT      (Orbit 223). There are additional KSC opportunities on 4/20 at 7:33am      (Orbit 237) &amp; 9:08am (Orbit 238), also at the EDW (Edwards Air Force      Base, Calif.) backup landing site at 9:00am EDT (238), 10:36am (239) &amp;      12:11 (240), plus some on 4/21.  If landing takes place on Monday at      8:51:22am as planned, Discovery will have circled Earth 222 times,      covering a distance of 5,813,261 stat.mi. (9,301,218 km).   [Current weather forecast for Monday calls for      showers within 30 n.mi. of the Shuttle Landing Facility (which would be a      flight rule violation) and the potential for low cloud ceilings.]</li> </ul> 
  At wake-up (12:21am this morning), CDR Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime this noon, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  Also at wake-up, FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued their current week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s fourth, Tracy’s first, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  Additionally, Caldwell-Dyson continued her FD15 session of the medical protocol for Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her first on board, performing the first urine pH spot test (not sampling) and later logging today’s diet intact.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Tracy required considerably more time for the session than scheduled since her packed food, delivered on 19A, took time for sorting out (probably should have been pre-organized on the ground.]
 
  Tracy, Timothy Creamer &amp; Soichi Noguchi completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  Prior to hatch closure, final science samples were transferred by FE-2 &amp; FE-5, with Tracy packing one DCB (Double Coldbag) with samples from MELFI-2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2, in US-Lab) and MELFI-1 (in Kibo JEM), including ice bricks for cold storage, while Soichi packed the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) fridge on the Shuttle with samples from ISS.
 
  For the STS-131 undocking, the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) was powered down (from 3:55am-12:10pm), with GLA (General Luminaire Assembly) lights minimized, JPM cabin fan A off, fan B in low mode, SD (Smoke Detector) A off &amp; SD B remaining active.
 
  Crew activities before and during undocking included –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Noguchi closing the      protective window shutters on Kibo, Lab and Cupola,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Creamer tearing down the      oxygen transfer equipment, used to supply Shuttle O<sub>2</sub> to the      spacewalkers for prebreathing;</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">TJ also configuring the      PMA-2 for depressurization after the undocking, followed by</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Setting up the departure      configuration at the PMA-2 and standing by at the Lab RWS (Robotics      Workstation) A31p laptop with a stopwatch to monitor the proper      performance of automatic undocking software for the PMA-2 departure under      Russian thruster attitude control and to immediately mode ISS to attitude      control if undocking software fails.    [The procedure      provides for the crewmember to take over the automatic operational      attitude control sequence manually if the software does not resume control      after the period of free drift a few minutes after physical      separation.  Free drift is employed to prevent a conflict between the      control systems of the two vehicles (ISS &amp; Shuttle) and to      “limp” (unload) the docking mechanisms], and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Soichi using the NIKON      digital camera and PD-100 camcorder to document the undocking, backing      away &amp; separation of the Discovery.</li> </ul> 
  CDR Kotov verified proper operation of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM (Service Module) for taking structural dynamics data during the Shuttle undocking.  Afterwards, Oleg downlinked the measurement data to the ground.     [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
  After the undocking –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">TJ Creamer depressed the      PMA-2 and conducted the subsequent leak check of the Node-2 forward hatch      (by periodically monitoring pressure readings) at the MPEV (Manual      Pressure Equalization Valve);</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">TJ then deconfigured the      C&amp;T (Command &amp; Tracking) video set up, uninstalling the video cap      in Node-2 which enabled reception of video from the docked Discovery;      followed by</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Deconfiguring the BPSMU      (Battery Powered Speaker Microphone Unit) and its long single drag-through      line, used during the docked phase, then stowing the equipment; and      finally</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Removing the THC IMV      (Temperature &amp; Humidity Control Intermodule Ventilation) air duct in      Node-2.</li> </ul> 
  FE-5 Noguchi returned PEPs (Portable Emergency Provisions) back to their nominal stage positions, i.e., PBA (Portable Breathing Apparatus) #1019 from the A/L (Airlock) to COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) endcone &amp; PBA #1017 from A/L to Node-3.
 
  Noguchi then powered down the PCS (Portable Computer System laptops in the US A/L (Airlock) and in COL.
 
  Working afterwards in Node-3 on the WRS (Water Recovery System), Noguchi set up the newly installed RFTA ( Recycle Filter Tank Assembly)  for the periodic backfill, with ground support, from the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) with QD (Quick Disconnect) hose.
 
  Also in Node-3, Soichi conducted the periodic manual filling of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) flush water tank (EDV-SV), terminated after ~26 min.
 
  Afterwards, Noguchi had ~1 hr for unpacking 19A cargo items.
 
  Timothy deployed two additional VSWs (Video Streaming Workstations) in Node-2, connecting them to power, the reloading VWS2 and placing it on the network.
 
  TJ worked on the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5), returning the laptop to nominal configuration after its successful use for downlinking the LDRI (Laser Dynamic Range Imager) data from the Orbiter late TPS inspection.    [The Ultrabay Adapter &amp; 60 GB HDD (Hard Disk Drive) were replaced with the usual floppy disk drive temporarily stowed nearby.]
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson deployed two new 19A-delivered cue cards for dealing with NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia) contamination in the Ammonia Contamination Kit in the FGB (behind Panel 309).
 
  Later, Tracy had ~3.5 hrs set aside for updating onboard SODF (Station Operations Data File) EMER books with 19A-arrived PCNs (Page Change Notices).     [The activity involved collecting 6 copies of the 20A Emer 1 Book from the Lab, SM, Airlock, Node-2, Soyuz 21S &amp; Soyuz 22S, replacing about 50 pages, discarding the old pages and redeploying the books in their nominal locations.]
 
  Later, the FE-2 verified proper closure of the Lab, JPM &amp; Cupola window shutters to protect from the upcoming Progress 35P purge venting.
 
  The crew completed today’s physical workout regime on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-1, FE-3).   
  
 T2/COLBERT Update:   The T2 treadmill is currently only being used in unpowered mode, after its PAU (Power Avionics Unit) exhibited increased temperatures, most likely due to a short circuit in a power converter to the treadmill motors.  Workouts in unpowered mode are entirely satisfactory from Flight Surgeon’s standpoint.
