EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments for Space Station Racks (EXPRESS Rack): Crew performed the Common Laptop Software (CLS) 14 installation setup on EXPRESS Laptop Computer 8 (ELC-8). The EXPRESS Racks support science experiments in any discipline by providing structural interfaces, power, data, cooling, water, and other items needed to operate science experiments in space.
Systems:
Hatch Seal Inspection: As part of periodic maintenance, the crew cleaned and inspected the USOS hatch seals and hatch plate sealing surface for Node 3 Nadir and Starboard. The crew inspected the hatch seal beads for FOD, nicks, burrs, cuts, or gouges that would impair a proper seal. The crew also inspected the crank handle mechanism and hatch seal interlocking joints for foreign object debris (FOD) or damage. The crew removed dust with ac vacuum and hatch seal brush.
Station Reorganization: Today, to decongest some of the clutter built up across the ISS over the years, the crew organized stowage and crew preference items across station. The reorganization should aid the crew as they move though the station and work on science and maintenance.
Crew Handover Video: Today, the crew recorded videos for future crew handovers and pre-flight familiarization to help crew adjust to ISS daily life. In the recording, the crew gave tips for the life onboard, setting up Public Affairs Events (PAOs), exercising, IT onboard, and any other topics at the crew’s discretion.
