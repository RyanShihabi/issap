ISS On-Orbit Status 01/16/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – off-duty day.
 
 FE-1 Suraev began the day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by Maxim on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 In the Pirs DC1 (Docking Compartment), Suraev terminated the discharge of Orlan 825M3 battery pack 1 and started the process on Pack 2, ending it before sleep time.
 
 The five station residents performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
 As part of the house cleaning, Suraev &amp; Kotov conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and also Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
 Additionally, Maxim checked the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter units of the SM’s and FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
 FE-4 Kotov conducted the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWC (Collapsible Water Container, #1030) to the RS (Russian Segment) for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis into oxygen &amp; (waste) hydrogen, filling the designated KOV EDV container.  Once filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.     [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles are detected in the EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.]
 
 FE-5 Noguchi completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and File Server SSC  (Station Support Computer) laptops.
 
 Maxim continued the extended leak integrity checking of the spare BZh Liquid Unit (#056) for the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator, recharged on 12/15 with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) to 1 atm (1 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>), by conducting the usual pressure check and repressing it to verify the unit’s hermeticity.    [Objective of the monthly checkout of the spare BZh, which has been in stowage since March 2007, is to check for leakage and good water passage through the feed line inside of the BZh (from ZL1 connector to the buffer tank) and to check the response of the Electronics Unit’s micro switches (signaling “Buffer Tank is Empty” &amp; “Buffer Tank is Full”.  During Elektron operation, the inert gas locked up in the BZh has the purpose to prevent dangerous O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> mixing.  A leaking BZh cannot be used.]
 
 The FE-1 also performed the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit.    [The AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO<sub>2</sub> during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP).]
 
 Jeff Williams, TJ Creamer &amp; Soichi Noguchi filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 At ~ 5:40am, Suraev &amp; Kotov engaged in a PAO phone interview via S-band with Ekaterina Beloglazova, Editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos Magazine, an old friend of ISS cosmonauts.    [“Your impressions and assessment of EVA activities.-  Oleg, did the station change any?  Was there anything new?  Do you enjoy your internet blog?-  What have you been doing lately and what are your short-term plans?-  Please, tell about your big team, some interesting recent events.”]
 
 At ~9:10am, the crew held their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
 At 9:40am-9:55am and 11:15am-11:30am, Maxim &amp; Oleg conducted two ham/amateur radio sessions with students, alumni and faculty of Kursk State Technical University.
 
 At ~10:40am, the crew was scheduled for the (normally weekly) teleconference with ISS Program Management at JSC/Houston via Ku-band/video &amp; S-band/audio.
 
 At ~3:05pm, Williams will have his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
 As another VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) program, TJ Creamer worked on the FIR Fluids (Integrated Rack).    [TC first set up the US camcorder for videoing his activities, then opened the lower &amp; upper doors, pulled out the FIR Optics Bench and configured it by installing the LMM (Light Microscopy Module) WIP hose for ground operation.  After closing up the FIR and activating two switches, Creamer notified POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) that the rack was prepared for commanding via RPC (Remote Power Controller).  The activity concluded by the installation of the MRB (Microgravity Rack Barrier) on the front of the FIR.]
 
 For his own VolSci program for JAXA, Soichi Noguchi prepared the G1 camcorder, then tookthe audience on an HD video tour around the ISS/Kibo complex, with his narration.
 
 Kotov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.
 
 Jeff donned the Glenn treadmill harness with installed transducer instrumentation (fifth time for him), then activated the harness for his exercise run on the T2/COLBERT treadmill.     [Afterwards, the CDR downloaded the harness data and filled out a survey questionnaire to complete the SDTO (Station Development Test Objective).]
 
 CDR, FE-1, FE-4 &amp; FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Maxim at ~5:00am, Oleg at ~7:00am, Soichi at ~10:10am, Jeff at ~1:00pm EST.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).
 
 Later, Jeff transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
