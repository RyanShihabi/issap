SpaceX (SpX) Crew Dragon Demonstration 1:  On Saturday, SpX Crew Dragon successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket at 1:49 AM CT.  On Sunday, the vehicle successfully performed an autonomous rendezvous and docking onto the Node 2 forward International Docking Adapter (IDA). Soft capture occurred at 4:51 AM CT and hard mate was accomplished at 5:02 AM CT. Once docked, the Crew performed pressure checks, opened hatches, then ingressed the vehicle and took samples of the atmosphere. This uncrewed flight test marks a significant step towards returning capability to launch astronauts on a U.S. built spacecraft from U.S. soil. Undocking and splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean is planned for March 8.
