ISS On-Orbit Status 06/12/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sunday – Crew off-duty.  ATV2 reboosts.  Ahead: Week 13 of Increment 27/28.
 
 Happy Russia Day! Den’ Rossii is Russia’s National Holiday (established by Boris Yeltsin to celebrate national unity after the Russian parliament in 1990 formally declared its sovereignty), with large crowds in Red Square in Moscow, extending to Monday, 6/13. 
 
As one of the first “handover” activities, CDR Borisenko &amp; FE-4 Volkov jointly conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.      [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
Andrey &amp; Sergei also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
FE-3 Garan closed the protective external shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola &amp; Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) windows preparatory to today’s ATV2 reboosts.
 
Later, Ron worked briefly in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), first adjusting the VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) for situational monitoring, then removing the cold spot sponge of the BLB (Biolab) incubator’s biological isolation filter and labeling it as trash.
 
FE-5 Furukawa &amp; FE-6 Fossum were to undergo another obligatory CMS (Countermeasures Systems) overview, required of each new crewmember prior to the first physical exercised session, but could not complete it due to their currently missing exercise shoes. 
 
Shortly before their sleeptime, Satoshi &amp; Mike are to prepare their individual CEVIS (cycle ergometer with vibration isolation) PCMCIA memory cards by inserting them into their personal SSC (Station Support Computer), to be loaded with their exercise protocols by OCA uplink from the ground.
 
FE-1, FE-4 &amp; FE-5 took their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sergei at ~6:55am, Sasha at ~8:30am, Satoshi at ~2:30pm EDT.
 
FE-5 &amp; FE-6 also had their third post-launch PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Mike at ~11:30am, Satoshi at ~12:55pm.
 
The “old” crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).  FE-4 Sergei Volkov also exercised for one half of the protocol, on the T2 treadmill.
 
Jobs listed for Samokutyayev, Borisenko &amp; Volkov today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens   [uplinked targets were the volcanoes Popocatepetl in Mexico &amp; Puyeue in Chile],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Repacking 9 full-size CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags) in the RS (Russian Segment) for transfer to the ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 2) for disposal as per USOS agreement, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Preparing &amp; downlinking more reportages (text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).</li></ul> 
ISS Reboosts:   ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” conducted two separate one-burn reboosts of the ISS with its OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters, controlled by pre-set time tag cyclogram (BPP).  Results to be reported tomorrow.  Purpose: to deplete ATV2 of remaining propellant and set up phasing for 43P and ULF7:
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Reboost 1:  10:15am EDT: Duration 36 min 06 sec, delta-V 5.2 m/s (17.1 ft/s).  Expected mean altitude gain: ~9.2 km (5 nmi).
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Reboost 2:  2:20pm: Duration 40 min 12 sec, delta-V 5.8s (19.0 ft/s).  Expected mean altitude gain: ~10.1 km (5.5 nmi).
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked today.  (Current daylight-awake orbit tracks have transitioned into a seasonal pattern in which they temporarily parallel the terminator.  Consequently most of the nadir views of CEO target areas fall below the criteria for illumination, with darkness to the right of track and adequate lighting left of track.  Today none of the standard target areas has sufficient illumination.  This condition is expected to persist for the next 7-10 days.  Meanwhile, CEO researchers are continuing to look for dynamic events targets for which oblique views to left of track may be useful or nighttime targets.  Auroral activity in the Northern Hemisphere has spiked recently with the dramatic solar flare on 6/7.  May-June is also the seasonal peak period for observing noctilucent clouds (a.k.a. polar mesospheric clouds) in the Northern Hemisphere.)
