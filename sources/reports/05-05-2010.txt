ISS On-Orbit Status 05/05/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
  At wake-up, FE-1 Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the currently running Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).   [FE-1 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  CDR Kotov terminated his 8<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/SONOKARD, taking the recording device from his SONOKARD sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-MED laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [SONOKARD objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
  Also after wake-up, FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued their new week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s 5<sup>th</sup>, Tracy’s 2<sup>nd</sup>, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  With Part 1 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol begun yesterday by Timothy Creamer, Tracy Caldwell-Dyson today wrapped up the session by recording post-sleep data of the crew-worn acoustic dosimeters, downloading them to a T61p laptop, then stowing the dosimeters.  (Last time done: 4/20-4/21)   [Acoustic data must be taken twice per Increment, each time for the duration of the 16-hour crew workday.] 
 
  After activating &amp; inspecting the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), Timothy Creamer ran another session with the new IV Gen (Intravenous Fluids Generation) payload in the MSG, preparing sterile saline solution and transferring it to storage bags for return to Earth.    [Purpose of IV Gen is to demonstrate a prototype system to produce SWI (Sterile Water for Injection) in a zero-G environment.  Fluid physics data will allow for appropriate system scaling to meet advanced requirements of medical treatment and care capabilities for exploration missions to remote places, e.g., Mars.  Operating within the MSG, the experiment produces bags of purified water from potable water, preferably the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) output or from CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine) stores.  GN<sub>2</sub> is used to push the water into the Purifier.  After purification, the water is mixed with NaCl (Sodium Chloride, i.e. common table salt) to produce a normal saline solution for intravenous infusion.  This solution will be returned to Earth for testing.] 
 
  Creamer also started another sampling run (the 92<sup>nd</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
  Skvortsov serviced the BTKh-40/BIF payload in the TBU temperature-controlled incubator by switching the TBU temperature from +37 degC to +4 degC.
 
  FE-1 Skvortsov also conducted his first onboard session of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, “Study of<a name="_Toc416143806"></a><a name="_Toc416143862"></a><a name="_Toc416144063"> the Veins in the Lower Extremities), using the newly arrived </a>KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex which Kotov had unloaded from Progress 36P on 2/26 and installed in the SM.      [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Alexander set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump &amp; valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a “body box”) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).]
 
  After configuring the usual pumping equipment (Kompressor-M, hoses, adapters), the CDR initiated the transfer of urine from 3 EDV-U containers to the empty BV2 Rodnik storage tank of Progress M-04M/36P at the SM Aft port, then flushed the BV2 lines with disinfectant from an EDV.  (The BV1 tank was filled with urine on 4/22).     [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
  Later, Kotov, Caldwell-Dyson &amp; Kornienko had several hours reserved for stowing waste and excessed equipment on the Progress 36P cargo ship-turned-trash can, to be jettisoned on 5/10.
 
  In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Soichi Noguchi ran the second onboard research session with the ESA PASSAGES experiment, run from the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop.     [After installing the experiment equipment (light shield, trackball) on the MPL (Multipurpose Laptop) in front of the EPM (European Physiology Module), replacing missing latches on the NeuroSpat light shield frame, and loading the PASSAGES software on the NeuroSpat hard disk, the FE-5 conducted the science data collection as the subject, then stowed the equipment.  For downlinking the data, Soichi inserted the PASSAGES PCMCIA memory card into the EPM laptop and afterwards reconnected its power cable to its original EDR (European Drawer Rack) laptop.  PASSAGES is designed to test how astronauts interpret visual information in weightlessness: it aims at studying the effects of micro-G on the use of the ‘Eye-Height’ strategy for estimating allowed actions in an environment, and whether this could possibly decrease after a long exposure to weightlessness.]
 
  On the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab, FE-6 Creamer removed the alignment guides to allow activation of the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) by the ground for FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility) operations requiring a micro-G environment.
 
  Creamer also serviced the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) in the Lab, pausing both ERCs (Environment Research Chambers) from the ELC (Experiment Laptop Computer) and removing the ERC2’s root tray in order to access the chamber’s inner walls and backside for wiping up excess moisture.  The root tray was then reinstalled, and later TJ resupplied potable water to the ABRS facility for the APEX (Advanced Plant Experiments) Willow plants. (Done the first time on 11/29/09.)     [Excessive moisture in the ABRS ERC2 had the ABRS humidity control system struggling to meet the humidity set point.] 
 
  Oleg, Soichi &amp; Timothy reviewed a 20-min training video for the RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) photo activity in early preparation for the arrival of STS-132/Atlantis/ULF4 on 5/16.     [During the RPM, the crew will photograph the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Atlantis, to be downlinked for launch debris damage assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers, supported by the “timer”, and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
  FE-6 set up, checked out and conducted his 4<sup>th</sup> test run with the French/CNES neuroscientific research experiment “3D-Space” (SAP) as Subject #7, while free-floating, using the ESA MPPL (Multipurpose Laptop) with a prepared HDD (Hard Disk Drive), data storage on a PCMCIA memory card, and an electronic pen table connected to it.     [3D Space, which involves distance, writing and illusion exercises, is designed to test the hypothesis that altered visual perception affects motor control.  To do this, the subject is asked to reproduce shapes or text on an electronic pen tablet (Wacom Intuos3 A4) which allows researchers to record and analyze the reactions both on earth and in space.]
 
  FE-1 completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.,
 
  FE-3 Kornienko conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  Noguchi assembled the crew restraint for the Cupola, enabling crewmembers to work at the newly installed CUP RWS (Robotic Workstation) without floating away.
 
  In the US Airlock, Soichi continued preparations for the ULF4 spacewalks, today “degassing” four PWRs (Payload Water Reservoirs, #1005, #1018, #1024, #1025), i.e., manually removing gas bubbles (by self-centrifugation) to minimize the amount of air introduced into the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) feedwater tanks.     [The traditional procedure for “degassing” the container by first draining, then refilling it with a fully charged water CWC was replaced in 2004 by a rather ingenious new procedure developed and checked out on the KC-135 aircraft flying zero-G parabolas at JSC/Houston: Essentially, it involves the crewmember himself centrifuging the selected container by holding it away from the body and applying a slow rotation of ~15 rpm to himself, to separate air and water in the bag through centrifugal force, while simultaneously squeezing out the air by cinching down on bungee cords wrapped around the container.]
 
  Misha Kornienko conducted his third data collection for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.     [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
  Other activities completed by Mikhail Kornienko were –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Spending about an hour on      more newsreel shooting using the using the SONY HVR-Z7 #2 high-definition      camcorder as part of the ongoing effort to create a photo &amp; video      imagery database on the flight of ISS-23/24 (“Flight      Chronicles”)  [footage subjects to be focused on include life      on the station, personal hygiene, food intake, playing with water,      enjoying weightlessness, exercise, moving about, station interior, Earth      surface, space clothing, cosmonaut at work, station cleaning, etc.  The      photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for      return to Earth on Soyuz.],</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Transferring GN<sub>2</sub>      (gaseous nitrogen) from Progress 36P storage (SrPK tank 2) to the ISS, used for      adjusting total cabin air pressure,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Performing the periodic      checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1      airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways. [Inspected      IP-1s      are in the passageways PrK      (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO      (SM Working Compartment), PkhO      (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO,      PkhO–DC1,      PkhO–FGB      PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1], and
      Conducting another photography &amp; video session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner”      ocean observation program, obtaining data on color bloom patterns on ocean      surface areas, then copying the images &amp; audio files of his commentary      to the RSK-1      laptop.</li> </ul> 
  TJ Creamer conducted an audit/inventory of the FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) contents in the Lab’s O5_A1 locker.
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson performed regular service on the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), changing out its UR (Urine Receptacle) hose and IF (Insert Filter), then vacuumed the entire WHC and cleaned it with disinfectant wipes. [The old UR &amp; IF were double-bagged and stowed for disposal.]
 
 
  Later, FE-2 supported the ground in swapping the Lab THC CCAA (Temperature &amp; Humidity Control / Common Cabin Air Assembly) air conditioner from Starboard to Port by closing off the LAB1S6 MFCV (Manual Flow Control Valve) and opening the LAB1P6 MFCV.  This allowed the swapover from the CCAA starboard channel (S6) to the alternate system on the port (P6) of the US Lab.  The ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) LTL was then switched accordingly, i.e., from starboard to port.    [The CCAA is a network of ducting that draws in the air through filters, delivers it for conditioning, and returns it to the modules.  The swap-over between the CCAA channels is generally done by the ground once a month, with crew support, to dry out the heat exchanger of the deactivated side.  MCC-H flight controllers command the required systems configurations for the dryout via S-band.]
 
  Caldwell-Dyson set up the US Lab camcorder to cover activities, then worked on the FCF FIR (Fluid Combustion Facility Fluids Integrated Rack) to remove/replace a CVB (Constrained Vapor Bubble) Module for another test.      [Tracy opened the lower &amp; upper FCF (Fluids Combustion Facility) doors, translated the FIR Optics Bench out of the rack, rotated the LMM (Light Microscopy Module) Spindle Bracket Assembly from Operate to Service position for removing the LMM Optical Test Target from the LMM X-Y Stage, installed the CVB Module onto the LMM X-Y Stage in preparation for module testing, and then rotated the LMM Spindle Bracket Assembly back to Operate position.  After closing the upper &amp; lower FCF doors, Tracy turned on two switches and notified POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) that the rack was prepared for command on RPC (Remote Power Controller.]
 
  For setting up the new RBO-3-1 Matryoshka-R instrumentation in the ISS, FE-1 Skvortsov transferred and installed FANTOM (phantom) kits delivered on Progress 37P.    [Background:  The Matryoshka facility has been used on the ISS for radiation science experiments since 2004, as follows:  MTR-1 was performed outside the ISS/SM with active &amp; passive detectors 2/26/04 – 8/18/05; MTR-2A was performed inside (DC-1), with passive detectors only, 1/5/06 – 12/7/06); MTR-2B was conducted inside the Russian part of the ISS (DC-1 &amp; SM) with active &amp; passive detectors from 10/18/07 – 3//09.  The new Matryoshka-Kibo is the fourth experiment performed with the Matryoshka facility onboard the ISS; it covers for the first time measurements made inside the Japanese Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), complementing the earlier Matryoshka results by adding radiation data acquired during a different phase of the solar cycle.  For Matryoshka-Kibo, a new set of passive dosimeters will be delivered to the ISS on Progress and shortly thereafter installed in the “Phantom” which then will be transferred to its stowage location inside Kibo.] 
 
  Afterwards, Skvortsov set up the DZZ-13 equipment for another run of the Russian RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) science experiment, then conducted a sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor) from SM window #9, later downlinking data from the RSE1 laptop and removing the hardware.      [RUSALKA ops involve calibration and tests of research equipment relating to the Sun and the Earth's limb at sunset (atmosphere lighted).  To be tested are the procedure for remote determination of Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) &amp; Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) content in the atmosphere (in the First Phase), measurement of CH<sub>4</sub> &amp; CO<sub>2</sub> content in the atmosphere and reception of data on NI2 and NI4 content over the territories subjected to natural and technogenic effects, reception of sufficient data on seasonal dependencies of tropospheric parameters being studied (in the Second Phase).  Equipment used:  Rusalka monoblock, Nikon D2X(s) digital photo camera; AF VR Nikkor ED 80-400f/4.5-5.6D lens with ultraviolet filter, bracket for attachment to the window, and Rusalka-Accessories set.  Support hardware: Device TIUS/DKShG/PNSK, Laptop RSK1, and Software Package loading disk.]
 
  Servicing the newly arrived biotechnology experiments, Alexander transferred the BTKh payloads from KRIOGEM-03M to the thermostat-controlled TBU incubator (set to +4 degC).
 
  FE-2 conducted the periodic status checks and necessary maintenance of the CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) payload.
 
  In the COL, with the VCA1 pointed to cover her activities, Tracy performed troubleshooting on the VMU DLT (Video Management Unit / Digital Line Tape) of the FSL (Fluids Science Laboratory).     [The DLT came with the new Tape Recorder which Soichi Noguchi installed along with two new HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) on 3/5 to upgrade the VMU.  Today’s troubleshooting consisted of demating and then remating the data &amp; power connector from/to the VMU DLT Tape Recorder in order to ensure a tight and stable connection.  If required, Tracy was to use tie wraps and/or Kapton tape to secure the data connection.]
 
  TJ worked on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser and its VIS (Vibration Isolation System), replacing both cable arm ropes (last time done: 3/2), inspecting guide rails &amp; rollers, and greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails &amp; rollers.
 
  Immediately before his sleep time, Soichi is scheduled for the PanOptic eye test which requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination performed by TJ as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) with an ophthalmoscope.     [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still &amp; video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula &amp; optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.]
 
  Also shortly before sleep time, FE-1 Skvortsov will set up the Russian MBI-12 Sonokard payload and start his 3<sup>rd</sup> experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.  Oleg took photography of Sasha’s preps.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
  At ~4:35am EDT, the Japanese Flight Engineer downlinked a 20-min JAXA EPO (Educational Payloads Operation) program for children via the HD (high-definition) video equipment and high data rate ICS (Inter-Orbit Communication System) link, talking to students at the JAXA Space School in Tsukuba/Japan from the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).    [With the primary objective being to conduct interactive lessons from JPM, Soichi lectured students about the difference of physical phenomenon between 0G &amp; 1G using the ICS communication link which is able to connect Kibo and SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center) in Tsukuba directly.  Students and Soichi were able to communicate via live video and voice during the lecture. JAXA had selected 6 students from the public.]
 
  The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-3). 
 
  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Bangkok, Thailand (the crew had a near-nadir pass over this capital city.  Bangkok has the largest urban area in Thailand, and is one of the leading cities of Indochina.  General context views of the metropolitan area and surrounding region were requested), Lilongwe, Malawi (weather was predicted to be mostly clear over the capital city of Malawi.  Lilongwe was visible slightly to the left of track.  The city is located to the southwest of Lake Malawi.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban area and surroundings were requested; such context imagery will aid in locating higher resolution imagery), East Haruj Megafans, Libya (ISS passed over the northwestern portion of the East Haruj megafan complex.  Illumination conditions should have highlighted the small channels that define the megafan surfaces.  Overlapping nadir-viewing frames, taken along track, were requested), and Bissau, Guinea-Bissau (aiming to the right of track for the capital city of Bissau.  General context views of the city and surrounding region were requested).
