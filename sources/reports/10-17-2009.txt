  FE-5 Jeff Williams started out with Day 3 of the sleep shift sequence for the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS), which is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following the sleep shift.    [The experiment consists of a 5-min reaction time task that will allow the subject to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  Continuing her support for the JAXA Space Seed payload in the Kibo’s CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility), FE-2 Nicole Stott relocated the four Space Seed KFTs (KSC Fixation Tubes) in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) from 2 degC to -95 degC storage.
 
  Nicole also completed the now regular transfer of pre-treated Russian urine directly from EDV-U container into the Lab UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) for processing, done each morning for about 5 minutes.  She will do it a second time later tonight after wakeup (~5:30pm).
 
  Before their early sleeptime (9:00am), FE-1 Suraev and FE-3 Romanenko took the periodic O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.  Later tonight after wakeup, the O-OHA test is also on schedule for CDR De Winne, FE-2 Stott, FE-4 Thirsk, FE-5 Williams.     [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There have been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.]
 
  FE-5 Williams began Day 1 of his first session (FD15) with the NASA/JSC experiment NUTRITION w/Repository, focusing today on the blood draw.   Bob Thirsk assisted with the phlebotomy from an arm vein.  Afterwards, Jeff began the 24-hour urine collections of the NUTRITION protocol, i.e. through the early sleeptime and the second wake period tonight.   [After the phlebotomy, Jeff’s samples were first allowed to coagulate in the Repository for 20-30 minutes, then spun in the HRF RC (Human Research Facility/Refrigerated Centrifuge) and finally placed in MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  No thruster activity was allowed during the blood drawing.  The RC was later powered off after a temperature reset to limit wear on the compressor, and cleaned.  The NUTRITION project is the most comprehensive in-flight study done by NASA to date of human physiologic changes during long-duration space flight.  It includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, nutritional assessments, and hormonal changes, expanding the previous Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) testing in three ways: Addition of in-flight blood &amp; urine collection (made possible by supercold MELFI dewars), normative markers of nutritional assessment, and a return session plus 30-day (R+30) session to allow evaluation of post-flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation.]
 
  Thirsk started transferring fresh food containers from the HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle) to the ISS as first step in the ensuing food consolidation.  De Winne will continue the activity later tonight after wakeup.
 
  Frank had time set aside this morning and tonight for more cargo transfers from the HTV to the ISS and trash in the reverse direction, followed by a 15-min debriefing/bookkeeping tagup with ground specialists.  Bob will join the effort later tonight.
 
  FE-3 Romanenko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.  Max Suraev is scheduled to do it again tonight after the Progress docking.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
  
  All crewmembers have their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) on their timelines, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Max &amp; Roman this morning (6:15am, 6:45am), Nicole &amp; Bob tonight (5:30pm, 9:15pm), and Bob, Frank &amp; Jeff tomorrow morning (5:15am, 7:00am, 8:15am).
 
  After wakeup at 5:30pm tonight, FE-4 Thirsk s scheduled for another participation in the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  Later tonight, Thirsk, Jeff &amp; Frank also are scheduled for filling out their regular weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC.    [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  Jeff will also have Day 4 of the sleep shift sequence for the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS), which is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following the sleep shift.
 
  The crew has two physical exercise periods today, a 1-hr workout this morning (on CEVIS/FE-2; TVIS/FE-1, FE-4; and ARED/CDR, FE-3, FE-5), and the regular daily 2-hr. program tonight (CEVIS/CDR, FE-1; TVIS/FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5; ARED/CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5; and VELO/FE-3). 
 
  Following the sessions, Jeff &amp;  Frank are to transfer the exercise data files to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  After their wakeup tonight (~5:30pm), Romanenko &amp; Suraev will go through the usual preparations for the subsequent docking of the Progress 35P cargo ship, including –
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Testing of the RS (Russian Segment) video system, which uses the SONY HDV camera for transmitting over the MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder from FGB &amp; SM to downlink via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band in “streaming video” packets,
 <?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Configuring &amp; activating the FGB-based A31p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for the TV conversion to NTSC and Ku-band,

 MEDS Update:   FEV (­Food Envelope) replacements for the MDS (Mice Drawer System) was completed yesterday after initial difficulties, perhaps related to the MELFI spill.   Payload specialists are working with MCC-H engineers to get ambient humidity and temperature data for the MDS interior to determine if these may be factors contributing to problems with MDS subjects (three mice remain alive).  Measurements have indicated 73-80% humidity.
