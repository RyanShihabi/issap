ISS On-Orbit Status 02/27/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew rest day.
 
  At wake-up (1:00am EST), FE-1 Suraev did the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-1 again inspects the filters tonight before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  At wake-up, FE-6 Creamer started his FD60 (Flight Day 60) session of the Pro K protocol, his third onboard run, performing the first urine pH spot test and later logging his diet intact of today.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
  Later in the day, TJ set up the Nutrition/Repository/Pro K hardware for his 24-hour generic urine collections which will begin tomorrow.
 
  The five station residents performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the house cleaning, Suraev &amp; Kotov conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and also Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
  Later, the FE-1 worked on the BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment in the SM, using tweezers to thin out the plants, leaving the five most developed Mizuna plants in each row in Root Module #22 &amp; #21.  The removed plants were discarded.    [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-16 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP), currently planted with Mizuna seeds.  Mizuna (Brassica rapa nipposinica) is a tasty variety of Japanese mustard greens, also known as California Peppergrass, eaten as a salad.] 
 
  With the UPA (Urine Processing Assembly) up and running, CDR Williams completed another manual fill of its WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly) in the morning, from a Russian EDV-U (urine collector-water container).
 
  In the SM, Maxim completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Jeff Williams’ planned PanOptic eye test, which was deferred yesterday, will be conducted today just before bedtime.  The test requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination performed by Noguchi as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) with an ophthalmoscope.    [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still &amp; video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula &amp; optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.]
 
  Timothy Creamer completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops.
 
  In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Soichi Noguchi conducted a second hermeticity test on the newly installed CGSE (Common Gas Supply Equipment) valve unit, using the CGSE Upper GBU (Gas Bottle Unit) with CO<sub>2</sub> for leak checking.    [The first leak test was done on 2/25.  The CO<sub>2</sub> is supplied for the upcoming Myo Lab Experiment during Flight 19A.]
 
  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive device (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).
 
  For their new session of taking their Bisphosphonates Alendronate pill starting tomorrow morning, Soichi &amp; Jeff begin their required overnight fast tonight: no intakes except plain water until 30 min after swallowing the pill.
 
  At ~6:00am EST, FE-5 Noguchi had a CDE (Crew Discretionary Event) via S-Band and Public Call 4 for audio and KU for video.
 
  At ~8:05am, the crew held their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  At ~11:00am EST, CDR Williams conducted his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
  At ~2:00pm, FE-1 Suraev &amp; FE-4 Kotov downlinked a PAO TV message of congratulatory greetings to V.P. Savinykh for his 70th anniversary on 3/7.    [Viktor Petrovich Savinykh, a veteran pilot-astronaut and twice Hero of the Soviet Union, Doctor of Engineering, Professor, Associate Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and chief editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos Journal, is the President of the Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography.]
