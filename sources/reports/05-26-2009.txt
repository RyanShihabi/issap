ISS On-Orbit Status 05/26/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Last 3 days with crew of 3.
 
  Upon wakeup, CDR Gennady Padalka terminated his fourth experiment session for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/SONOKARD, by taking the recording device from his SONOKARD sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-MED laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [SONOKARD objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
  FE-2 Koichi Wakata continued his third session of sleep logging for the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a week-long session.    [To monitor the crewmember’s sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, Koichi wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as his patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and uses the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  FE-1 Mike Barratt set up the Russian C&amp;C (Command &amp; Control) computer in the US Lab, connecting the laptop with a 10m Ethernet cable to the ISL (Integrated Station LAN).    [The PC was plugged in at the LAB1D1 UIP (Utility Interface Panel).]
 
  The CDR &amp; FE-1 continued their preparations for the Orlan EVA (#22) on 6/5 and the suited training exercise on 6/3, performing further Orlan spacesuit activities in the DC1 “Pirs” Docking Compartment.  
  After configuring the DC1 STTS communications link to support their presence, Padalka &amp; Barratt today –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Completed individual fit      sizing (central strap, lateral strap, hip strap, calf strap, arm cable and      shoulder size, front &amp; rear) on their Orlan-MK spacesuits (#5 for      CDR/red stripe, #6 for FE-1/blue stripe),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Ran leak checks &amp;      valve functionality tests on the Orlans and their BSS interface units in      the DC1 &amp; SM PkhO (Service Module Transfer Compartment) from the EVA      support panels (POV);</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Performed leak checking on      the backup bladder of Orlan-MK #6, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Conducted pressure checks      on the SM BK-3 oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) tanks and the BNP portable repress O<sub>2</sub>      tank in the DC-1 airlock module, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Restored DC1 STTS      communications to nominal settings.</li> </ul> 
  Padalka performed the frequent status check on the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment, verifying proper operation of the BU Control Unit and MIS-LADA Module fans (testing their air flow by hand).   [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-15 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]
 
  The FE-1 underwent his first periodic (generally monthly) health test with the cardiological experiment PZEh MO-1 (“Study of the Bioelectric Activity of the Heart at Rest”) on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System), with Gennady Padalka assisting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).     [Equipment used were VPG/Temporal Pulsogram and ECG/Electrocardiogram Data Output Devices (USI).  During the 30-min. test, the CDR tagged up with ground specialists on an RGS (Russian Groundsite) pass at ~9:30am via VHF for data downlink from the VPG and Gamma-1M ECG for about 5-6 minutes.]
 
  After having powered down the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization) early in the morning, FE-2 Wakata conducted troubleshooting on the exercise device.    [The leading cause for the abnormal noise had tentatively been identified as a damaged spring inside of the forward right stabilizer.  Today’s activities involved removing the TVIS from the “pit” in the SM floor, pinning the forward right stabilizer by installing a pip pin in it, and disconnecting the power/data cable to the stabilizer.  After installing the TVIS back in the pit, Wakata performed a one-hour ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout) speed test and exercise session on it while capturing audio, video and data for evaluation by the ground.  At this time, the FE-2, who will return on STS-127, is currently within his last 30 days prior to landing, and regaining TVIS exercise capability is a high priority.]
 
  The FE-2 also had an hour for troubleshooting two power jumpers (0001, 0002) for the Lab System Rack, by checking them out with power from two UIP outlets for tripping an RPC (Remote Power Controller).
 
  Gennady set up and started the SSTV (Slow Scan TV) equipment for conducting the MAI-75 experiment as part of OBR-3 (Obrazovanie-3, Education 3) ops, essentially a ham radio set-up with Kenwood VS-N1 (Visual Communicator) gear for downlinking photographic images to ground stations, including one at MAI (Moscow Aviation Institute).  The experiment will run three back-to-back SSTV Ham sessions over today and tomorrow.    [The payload is named after the renowned MAI whose reputation is based on the large number of famous aviators and rocket scientists that received their academic education here.  Among the alumni are Academicians and Corresponding Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Over 100 General and Chief Designers earned their degree at MAI, with famous rocket scientists like Makeyev, Mishin, Nadiradze and Yangel.  MAI also fostered 20 Pilot-Cosmonauts, almost 100 famous test pilots, Heroes of the Soviet Union and Russia.  The amateur radio (ham) equipment aboard the ISS for downlinking SSTV imagery is an MAI product.]
 
  Barratt &amp; Padalka completed their second standard 30-min Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) skill training, using the D2X digital still cameras with 400 &amp; 800mm lenses to take Earth Observation imagery from Windows 6 or 8 in the SM facing the velocity vector.  Afterwards, Mike downlinked the obtained photographs for ground analysis.     [The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle (STS-127/Endeavour/2J/A) on 6/15.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Endeavour, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
  Koichi performed the regular service on the WPA (Water Processor Assembly), first offloading the WPA into two of the new CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine, #1022) with the common H<sub>2</sub>O Transfer Hose (which took about 26 min) from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary Port, then flushing the system.
 
  Gennady completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  The FE-2 conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-2), TVIS treadmill (FE-2), ARED (CDR, FE-1) and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).    [On 5/24, Koichi successfully completed the re-assembly of CEVIS and performed a quick check-out with no unusual issues or messages on the control panel.  CEVIS is back in business.] 
 
  Later, Barratt transferred the exercise data file to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  At ~7:05am EDT, Koichi Wakata powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at ~7:10am conducted a ham radio session with students at Miyahara Junior High School at, Saitama, Japan.   [Miyahara Junior High School was established in 1947.  The current number of students is 1014.  Koichi attended and graduated from this school.]
 
  CDR Padalka had another run with the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program on his discretionary “time permitting” task list, using the NIKON D2X digital camera to take 800mm-lens telephotos for subsequent downlinking on the BSR-TM payload data channel,
  
 Soyuz TMA-15/19S Update:  At Baikonur, after a 6-hr delay due to high steppe winds, the Soyuz TMA-15/19S vehicle was erected on the pad, and L-1 operations are proceeding.  At a meeting of the State Commission today V.V. Tsibliev, chief of GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center), reported on crew readiness, followed by V.A. Lopota, President &amp; General Designer of S.P.Korolev RSC Energia reporting on the readiness of the Soyuz-FG/Soyuz TMA system for further pre-launch processing.  The State Commission confirmed the primary &amp; backup crews of TMA-15 &amp; ISS-20, and also made a decision to proceed with the preparation of the launcher/spacecraft system for fueling and launch at the scheduled time, tomorrow at 6:34 am EDT.
