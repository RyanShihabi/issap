ISS On-Orbit Status 08/20/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
 At wake-up, Alex Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Also before breakfast, the CDR finished the second set of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol on the Soyuz 23S crew, i.e., Wheelock, Yurchikhin &amp; Walker, after 24 hours of recording (with a microphone on the shirt collar), downloading the dosimeter data to a T61p SSC (Station Support Computer).     [The first set focused on the 22S crew of Skvortsov, Caldwell-Dyson &amp; Kornienko.  Acoustic data must be taken twice per Increment, each time for the duration of the 16-hour crew workday.]
 
 The crew started out with the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement, using the IM mass measurement device.  Kornienko set up the IM and later stowed it away.      [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IM "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed.]
 
 After wake-up, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued her 4-day session of the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 4<sup>th</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 For Shannon Walker, it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of her 4-day Pro K controlled diet &amp; diet logging session, after the urine pH spot test, in her third onboard run.
 
 For Douglas Wheelock, it was the first day of his 3<sup>rd</sup> session with the Pro K protocol after the urine pH spot test.
 
 Tracy also started another 24-hr collection of urine samples for the NUTRITION / Repository / Pro K protocol, her 2<sup>nd</sup> (FD120) onboard session with the new routine (modified from the past NUTRITION w/Repository protocol).  Later in the day, Caldwell-Dyson broke out and set up the equipment for tomorrow’s blood sample collection.     [The operational products for blood &amp; urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads have been revised, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
 Caldwell-Dyson, Wheelock &amp; Walker continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 3<sup>rd</sup> for Doug &amp; Shannon, 7<sup>th</sup> for Tracy, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Additionally, the three US crewmembers completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.    [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Later, FE-6 Walker set up the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware, including MBS (Mixing Bag System), powered it up and then spent several hours performing her 2<sup>nd</sup> session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, integrated with Thermolab.  Later, she downloaded the data, including Thermolab, to a PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop, powered down, cleaned up and temporarily moved all hardware aside for subsequent crew operation.      [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
 Shannon also did the periodic status check &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) payload in the Lab.
 
 CDR Skvortsov checked out the US SLM (Sound Level Meter) instrument and then used it to conduct the periodic noise level measurements program in the station interior for a 2-hr acoustic survey, including transfer of the recorded data to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [A total of 61 acoustic measurements were to be obtained, specifically at 9 locations in the Lab, with WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) turned off, 12 locations in the SM, 11 in the JPM, 4 in JLP, 2 in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), 9 in Node-2, 8 in Node-3, and 6 in MRM1.  The SLM gives instantaneous noise levels and their frequency spectra, which are transferred to the MEC laptop via an RS232 cable and later downlinked with regular CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) data dump or via OCA.]
 
 Later, the CDR performed the periodic module hatch seal inspection, today at Node-1 Fwd, Node-1 Port, Lab Aft &amp; Node-3 Stbd.     [Downlink from Alex: “All hatch seals and handle mechanisms are OK.”  Photo review by the ground still to be completed.]
 
 Skvortsov also serviced the running experiment “Identifikatsiya” (TEKh-22/Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet, downloading structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA, supported by ground specialist tagup support.   (Last time done: 8/12).
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson completed the periodic inspection of the SPS ELPS (Secondary Power System/Emergency Light Power Supply) subsystems in Node-1 (3 units).    [One ELPS had to be skipped due to lack of time.]
 
 In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Tracy swapped two T61p laptops – SLT4 (System Laptop Terminal 4) with a new unit, SLT5, then relocated SLT5 (from UOP/Utility Outlet Panel 2b AD5 to UOPa3 FD6) and activated it.
 
 FE-3 Kornienko worked another 2h 30m on stowing discarded cargo in the Progress 38P cargo ship-turned-trash can, keeping track with the IMS (Inventory Management System).
 
 FE-6 Wheelock had ~2 hrs for gathering &amp; transferring US trash to be disposed of in 38P.
 
 Later, Mikhail conducted test &amp; checkout procedures on the new external Klest Kl-154M video camera which he &amp; Fyodor had installed during their EVA-25 on 7/27.    [For the testing, FE-3 activated the camera on DO14 (Daily Orbit 14) and played back the recorded footage on DO15 via the SONY HVR-Z1 camcorder for downlink to the ground, to assess whether this mode can be used for dynamic operations.]
 
 On TsUP Go, Kornienko was to repressurize the ISS cabin atmosphere with N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) from Progress M-06M/38P’s SrPK air supply tankage to make up total pressure. 
 
 Wheels went through the regular monthly session (his 2<sup>nd</sup>) of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on Nosebleed.   [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] 
 
 Tracy started out in the A/L (Airlock) on restowing EVA tools used in the EVA-17 spacewalk.   [More time will be required to finish this job.] 
 
 Also in the A/L, FE-4 terminated the discharge on EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) battery #2088 in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly), then put the battery away into stowage.
 
 Afterwards, Wheelock had ~1h set aside for post-EVA cleanup of the A/L, returning it to initial conditions by stowing all items back in their nominal stowage locations, checking that switches are in their nominal positions, and preparing EMUs &amp; equipment for long-term stowage.
 
 In more RS (Russian Segment) inventorying to create stowage space, FE-4 Yurchikhin went through stowage goods in the FGB, logging data of equipment packed in stowage bags in support of the selection of disposable cargo items by the ground.
 
 Fyodor then performed periodic service on the KNT-36 EXPOSE-R payload, copying the experiment’s science data from the BSMM Multiplex Bus Synchronization Unit/computer to a PCMCIA memory card in the RSS1 laptop.     [The European EXPOSE-R experiment, containing plant seeds and spores of bacteria &amp; fungi, was mounted outside the SM (Service Module) during the Russian EVA-21A on 3/11/09 after some earlier problems.] 
 
 Continuing his collecting of ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) coolant samples, Yurchikhin took an OPA (Ortho-phthalaldehyde) sample from the MTL (Moderate Temperature Loop) in the US Lab, after flushing.   [OPA is an antimicrobial agent in the ITCS fluid.]
 
 Later, FE-5 repeated the activity on the ITCS MTL coolant/OPA in Node-3, after FE-4 Wheelock had temporarily installed the protective orange-colored snubber alignment guides (4) on the T2/COLBERT treadmill.    [After the Node-3 ITCS sampling, Doug removed the alignment guides again.]
 
 Mikhail conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Alexander completed the daily IMS maintenance by updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Before crew sleep time, both Tracy &amp; Wheels are scheduled for the PanOptic eye test which requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination, performed by Wheels as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) with an ophthalmoscope on Tracy and later by Shannon Walker as CMO on Wheelock.     [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still &amp; video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula &amp; optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.]
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-4) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-3, FE-5).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 At ~4:05am EDT, the entire crew held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU/glavnaya operativnaya gruppa upravleniya), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
 At ~4:20am, Sasha, Misha &amp; Fyodor linked up with TsUP stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
 At ~10:00am, the crew convened for their standard bi-weekly teleconference with the JSC Astronaut Office (Steve Lindsey), via S-band S/G-2 audio &amp; phone patch.
 
 At ~1:30pm, Caldwell-Dyson held her regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
 At ~3:10pm, the crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H.
 
 At 4:00pm, Wheelock will have his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
 WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (24-0007H) lists 126 CWCs (2,854.0 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (25 CWCs with 1,042.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. /12.7 L in 17 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 44.0 L in 1 bag still requiring sample analysis, 128.3 L in 3 bags for flushing only with microbial filter, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only; 2. potable water (5 CWCs with 215.4 L, of which 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 1 bag with 42.5 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use;  3. iodinated water (84 CWCs with 1,550.1 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (24.1 L, in 1 bag with 6.3 L to be used only for OGA, 1 bag with 17.8 L for WPA WWT processing plus 8 empty bags; and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (1 CWC with 20.2 L from hose/pump flush &amp; 1 bag with 1.38 L from EMU dump).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Gaborone, Botswana (this capital city of about 200,000 is located near the southeastern border of the country on the Notwane River.  There may have been some clouds present as ISS passed over the region.  Looking for the city just north of a sizeable reservoir), and St. Helena Island, Atlantic Ocean (HMS Beagle Site: The crew most likely had partly cloudy weather conditions over this solitary, South Atlantic island.  While the island is perhaps most famous as the final resting place of exiled French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, the island was also visited by Charles Darwin during his famous voyage of 1836.  There are few visual cues for detecting this target except perhaps for its impact on the local oceanic cloud field.  Looking just right of track for detailed views of the whole island).
