Zebra Fish Muscle:  Gerst connected a water bag and a waste bag to the Aquatic Habitat water circulation unit and performed water exchange #6. The Zebra Fish muscle experiment asks if the atrophy of muscles under the condition of microgravity also occurs in Zebra Fish and why their atrophy occurs in the microgravity.
Cardio Ox (Human Research):  Wilmore, acting as the Crew Medical Officer operator, took return minus 15 days blood pressure and ultrasound measurements of subject Wiseman.  The objective of Cardio Ox is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis in astronauts.
Soyuz 39S Descent Drill:  Wiseman and Suraev prepared for their return by conducting a Soyuz descent drill. 39S is scheduled to return to earth with Suraev, Wiseman, and Gerst on November 10, 2014.
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Mobility Unit (EMU) Loop Scrub:  Wilmore and Gerst performed EMU loop scrubs throughout the day as part of the periodic EMU maintenance plan. Along with the loop scrubs, water samples were collected before and after the scrub. The water samples are scheduled to return via 39S in November. During the loop scrubs, the Fan Pump Separator associated with EMU 3005 did not activate as expected. The Loop Scrub for EMU 3005 was deferred as a result. The Loop Scrub on EMU 3011 was completed nominally without issues. Ground teams are working on a troubleshooting plan for the EMU 3005 Fan Pump Separator.
57P Docking Clamps Installation:  Yesterday’s docking of 57P was completed as planned.  After capture, the Progress hooks were closed. However, in order to preserve life cycles on the DC1 hooks, those hooks were not commanded to close.  Instead, the docking clamps were installed by Samokutyaev today.
