ISS On-Orbit Status 07/07/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev terminated his 4<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
FE-3 Garan completed his first session with the U.S. PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol as subject, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on BP (blood pressure) &amp; ECG (electrocardiogram) during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with BP/ECG equipment and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.  FE-6 Fossum assisted as Operator/CMO (Crew Medical Officer).      [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.] 
 
FE-4 Volkov removed the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) payload from the MRM2 “Poisk” module and relocated it to the DC1, to repeat the sensitivity experiment done yesterday in Poisk.  Purpose: to study how the direction of micro-accelerations, relative position and temperature gradient are affecting the structural dynamics micro-G sensor.     [During the day, Sergei performed stepwise sequential rotation of the sensor, in -45 deg increments, around its vertical Z-axis, with the X- &amp; Y-axes of sensitivity of the micro-acceleration sensor made ​​a full turn of 360 deg.  The measurement time at each position sensor was to be at least 30 minutes.  The procedure was photo-documented.]
 
FE-6 Fossum performed the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate water container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 21 min (during which WHC was not available).
 
Fossum conducted periodic water sampling activities including –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Routine service on the WRS (Water Recovery System) using the LFTP (Low Flow Transfer Pump) to transfer one CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine) to the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) and offloading it entirely,  [estimated offload time: 5.5 hrs; max. allowed quantity: 85%],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">The periodic (approx. weekly) WRS sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose,  [after the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2"> “Week 16” water sample collecting in Node-3 from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient &amp; Hot ports for inflight &amp; post-flight analysis    [from Ambient: 1000 mL for post-flight analysis; from Hot: 1000 mL for post-flight analysis, 250 mL for inflight TOCA analysis &amp; a 125 mL microbiology inflight sample.  The in-flight samples were subsequently processed in the MCD (microbial capture device) and CDB (coliform detection bag) from the U.S. WMK (water microbiology kit) for treatment/processing after no more than 6 hours of the collection.  After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">“Week 16” water sampling from the WRS potable water in the SM (Service Module) for chemical &amp; microbial analysis, using a specific water sample collection packet from stowage,   [collected were one 750 mL sample from the SVO-ZV port and one 500 mL post-flight sample from the SRV-K Warm port for return on ULF7].

</li></ul>CDR Borisenko &amp; FE-1 Samokutyayev worked ~1h45m in the SM installing &amp; connecting new SBI (Onboard Measurement System) cabling between the Elektron BZh Liquid Unit and the three electronic local temperature sensor commutators/switches (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system, routing the cables behind wall panels (#321 for LKT1A2, #217 for LKT1B2, #412 for LKT1V2).  BITS2-12 was then reconnected and activated.
 
FE-5 Furukawa prepared the Cupola for ULF7 robotics activities by relocating the SSC-17 (Station Support Computer 17) from Node-3 to the Cupola, converted to wireless for network access for use as ULF7 robotics video monitor, e.g. DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) checkout.  This was followed by the relocation of SSC-6 from the Lab to Node-3 as SSC-17’s replacement at the ARED exerciser.
 
Afterwards, Satoshi connected SSC-17 to the Cupola PCS (Portable Computer System) and configured DOUG for telemetry mode, checking it out and confirming that SARJ (Solar Alpha Rotary Joint) and BGA (Beta Gimbal Assembly) updates are representing the real situation.    [SSC-17 was to be left running DOUG in telemetry mode overnight.]
 
FE-3 Garan meanwhile inventoried/audited and reorganized the contents of a large cargo stowage bag in Node-2 containing water sampling items.        [This particular bag has been reported as ”filled to the brim”, which would require extra crew time to locate any items contained in it.] 
 
Ron also closed out the MCA (Major Constituent Analyzer) worksite on the AR1 (Atmosphere Revitalization 1) rack in the Lab, closing the HV01 manual valve and disconnecting the “anaconda” air hose.      [MCA is used as primary device for accurately monitoring oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the cabin air.]


Later, FE-3 performed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (28-0014D) lists 101 good CWCs (2,205.8 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (21 CWCs with 836.6 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 582.0 L in 14 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (68 CWCs with 1,241.3 L (also 36 expired or leaking bags with 658.8 L);  4. condensate water (91.6 L in 7 bags, plus 4 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (36.3 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
FE-5 Furukawa &amp; FE-6 Fossum conducted the 6<sup>th</sup> onboard JAXA HAIR experiment (the first for both), collecting hair samples of each other, then inserting them into MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), Dewar 1/Tray A at -95 degC and closing out the activity.
 
Afterwards, Satoshi gathered the items required for his next CsPINs 3 (Dynamism of Auxin Efflux Facilitators responsible for Gravity-regulated Growth and Development in Cucumber 3) experiment run (the 3<sup>rd</sup>), then started CsPINs Run 2-4 by first watering 3 CsPINs Chamber A sample units which were then inserted into 3 MEU Bs (Measurement Experiment Units B) for subsequent attachment of 2 units in the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) 1G IU (Incubator Unit) and one MEU B in CBEF’s Micro-G IU for the incubation duration (the next 26 hrs).      [Background: CsPINs studies the phenomenon of tropism, i.e., the growth or turning movement of a biological organism, usually a plant, in response to an environmental stimulus.  Specifically focusing on gravity, the new JAXA experiment investigates how plants sense gravity as an environmental signal and use it for governing their morphology and growth orientation.  CsPINs plays an important role in the regulation of gravity-dependent redistribution of auxin (a class of plant hormones) and thereby controls gravimorphogenesis (peg formation) in cucumber (Cucmis sativus L.) seedlings.  Gravitropism also interferes with hydrotropism in cucumber roots, in which the dynamism of these facilitators may also play a role.  Cucumber (Cucmis sativus) seedlings are used to analyze the effect of gravity on the expressions of CsPINs and unravel their contributions to peg formation.  Hydrotropism is differentiated from gravitropism in roots, and the expressions of CsPINs are compared to determine the interacting mechanism between the two tropisms.] 
 
Closing out on the recent V.4 software update for SSC laptops, Furukawa stowed laptops and equipment used during the SSCV4 transition, packing one hand drive (from SSC-9) which failed to load, for return on ULF7 for ground analysis. 
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
CDR Borisenko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Andrey also completed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways to ensure the ventilation/circulation system performs adequately with the six-member station crew.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.] 
 
Mike Fossum retrieved &amp; stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies, deployed by him on 7/5 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.      [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
Afterwards, FE-6 Fossum spent time in JAL (Joint Airlock) “Quest” to –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Terminate charging of the EMU LLB (Extravehicular Mobility Unit Long Life Battery) Li-Ion batteries initiated yesterday by Ron Garan,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Check out 3 PGT (Pistol Grip Tool) &amp; battery pairings, leaving batteries installed  [PGT 1002 w/battery 1005; PGT 1004 w/battery 1006; PGT 1007 w/battery 1008], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Clean out the JAL for the ULF7 EVA by unstowing trash and other unneeded items.</li></ul> 
After adjusting VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) for ground monitoring of his activities in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-3 Garan worked on the EPM (European Physiology Module), removing its failed VU (Video Unit) and replacing it with a new spare.  Later, he activated the EPM laptop.      [Activity steps included temporary removal of the MARES VIF (Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System / Vibration isolation Frame) and removing stowage items from the D3 rack front to make room, tilting the EPM ISPR forward for accessing the VU, removing &amp; replacing the unit, then reversing all preceding steps including restowing stowage items.]
 
Sasha Samokutyayev dedicated another 3 hrs to continue cargo transfers from Progress 43P, with moves logged in the IMS database.
 
FE-5 Furukawa had 2h50m set aside for continuing prepacking and staging ULF7 RTG (Return to Ground) cargo.  Later, at ~11:05am, Satoshi conducted a ULF7 prepack debrief tagup with ground specialists.
 
Sergei Volkov set up &amp; readied the equipment for a session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), to be conducted tomorrow by Andrei, Sasha &amp; himself.
 
Aleksandr performed the regular (weekly) inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness),
 
After terminating the overnight charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery and verifying functionality of the Piren-B Piroendoscope, Borisenko &amp; Volkov spent ~2.5 hrs with the KPT-12 payload with its BAR science instruments suite, using the Piren-B instrument to check out micro conditions of SM module surface in areas with identified signs of microflora growth on the pressurized shell surface.  Panels under scrutiny were 425, 429, 431 &amp; 433.  Problem area monitoring is necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data were copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities were supported by ground specialist tagup as required.        [Objective of the Russian KPT-12/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS (Russian Segment) panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-B is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
Before sleep time, Andrey Borisenko will prepare the Russian MBI-12 Sonokard payload and start his 4<sup>th</sup> experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
Before “Presleep” period tonight, Garan powers on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
At ~2:00pm, FE-3 Garan is scheduled for his regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists, discussing pre-ULF7 stowage questions.
 
At ~2:20pm, Borisenko, Volkov &amp; Samokutyayev will join up for a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking greetings to the participants of the Summit "Google Lunar X Prize" at NASA Ames Research Center.      [On 9/13/2007, the X PRIZE foundation and Google announced the kickoff of the Google Lunar X PRIZE competition to launch the first private mobile robot to the Moon.  Any team from any country in the world may participate in this competition.  The only mandatory requirement is private funding of the project (government funding may cover only 25% of expenses).  To win the first prize, the team must make a soft touchdown of its mobile robot (lunar rover) on the lunar surface before 12/31/2015.  After its touchdown, the lunar rover must cover at least of 500 meters and be able to send to the ground two at least 1 Gb data packets.  The only Russia’s official representative in Google Lunar X PRIZE competition is the Selenokhod Company from Dolgoprudny.  29 teams from 17 countries constitute the total number of participants.  The International Summit of the participants to launch the first private lunar rover in history will take place on 7/11-7/12/2011 in the US Silicon Valley (NASA ARC, in SETI - Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence).]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-1).
 
ULF7 Docking:  The IMMT (ISS Mission Management Team) determined this morning that the ISS is Go for ULF7 docking.  If STS-135/ULF7 launches as planned tomorrow, the ISS crew will have standard work days on Saturday and Sunday, July 9 and 10.  If the launch is delayed to Sunday, the ISS crew will have their nominal off days on Saturday and Sunday.
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Astana, Kazakhstan (nadir pass.  This capital city of nearly three-quarters of a million is located on the Ishim River in a flat semi-desert steppe), Mount Vesuvius, Italy (near nadir pass.  The volcano dominates the Gulf of Naples, with the cityscape and docks of Naples to the north, and the Isle of Capri to the south. Detailed images of this classic cone were requested.  The cone is forested and contrasts with the surrounding city and farmland), and Mexico City Aerosol (looking right &amp; shooting obliques that capture any haze in the atmosphere.  Margins of bodies of haze are of greatest interest.  Oblique views lengthen the line of sight and make subtle smog loadings more visible in the atmosphere images.  The bland backdrop of a sea surface also assists in seeing margins and denser areas of haze. Including a coastline in some images helps in identifying locations.  Haze from Mexico City and surrounding region—mainly smog, but including smoke from biomass burning, with some dust—wafts hundreds of miles from source).
