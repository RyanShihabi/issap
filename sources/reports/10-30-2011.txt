ISS On-Orbit Status 10/30/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Crew off duty.    Ahead:  Week 7 of Increment 29 (three-person crew).
 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">At Baikonur/Kazakhstan, the new cargo ship Progress M-13M/45P (#413) was launched this morning on time at 6:11am EDT on a Soyuz-U rocket fueled with 392 tons of LO<sub>2</sub>, over 80 tons of kerosene, and nearly 70 tons of LN<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and other elements.  Ascent was nominal, and all spacecraft systems were without issues.  All arrays and antennas deployed nominally (2 solar arrays, 5 KURS antennas, 1 Rassvet-M antenna for TORU, 1 SBI/M-BITS onboard measurement / telemetry system antenna).  Docking to the DC1 (Docking Compartment) Pirs nadir port is planned for Wednesday, 11/2, at ~7:40am, to deliver 750 kg (1,653 lbs) of propellant, 50 kg (110 lbs) of oxygen, 420 kg (926 lbs) of water and 1410 kg (3,108 lbs) of dry cargo (supplies, experiment hardware, etc.)]</li></ul> 
FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
At wakeup, CDR Fossum checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera &amp; flashlight battery charge and later in the day performed additional checks on the payload, looking for crystals, changing camera battery, downloading images and restarting the Intervalometer for automated flash photography.  The SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM software is not being used for this run.      [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking a photo of the turbid Sample 1 every hour.  While Sample 1 is running, crystal checks on Samples 6-10 will be performed each day.  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.]
 
As another VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activity, FE-5 Furukawa serviced the FPEF MS (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility / Marangoni Surface) payload in the JAXA Kibo laboratory by removing &amp; replacing 5 HDs (hard disks) of the IPU VRU (Image Processing Unit / Video Recording Unit),- #1027, #1028, #1029, #1030, #1031.         [The replaced VRU disks (#1021, #1023, #1024, #1025, #1026) were put in a Ziploc bag for return to SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center/Tsukuba)].
 
Sergey Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.  This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.       [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
At ~11:20am, Mike &amp; Satoshi held a CDE (Crew Discretionary Event) with Dan Burbank, the upcoming CDR of Expedition 30, currently at Star City, on training and handover topics.
 
The crew had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) on today’s schedule, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Satoshi at ~6:00am, Mike at ~9:05am, Sergey at ~3:45pm EDT.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4/), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR).
 
Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Continuing the preparation &amp; downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">The daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, verifying proper watering of the KM A32 &amp; A24 root modules;  [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Another ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Closing down the KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ experiment in MRM2 Rassvet and dismantling plus packing the payload equipment, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the Hudson Volcano in Chile and tropical typhoons in the Gulf of Mexico.</li></ul>
