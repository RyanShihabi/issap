46 Soyuz (46S) Undock and Landing: Jeff Williams, Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka are scheduled to undock from the ISS today at 4:51PM CDT and land in Kazakhstan at 8:14PM CDT. The ISS will be in 3-crew operations until the arrival of 48S on September 9, 2016.
Human Research Program (HRP) Collections: Flight Engineer (FE)-6 assisted FE-5 with HRP operations in performing blood sample collections and configuring the Refrigerated Centrifuge for the first set of sample load operations. FE-5 performed urine sample collections and processed the blood samples by setting up Refrigerated Centrifuge for two sample spins. The urine and blood samples were stowed in the Minus Eighty-degree Freezer for ISS (MELFI). These sample collections will be used to support the HRP: Biochem Profile, Repository, and Cardio Ox investigations. 
Cardio Ox Ultrasound and Blood Pressure Operations: With remote guidance from the Cardio Ox ground teams, FE-5 assisted FE-6 in conducting an ultrasound scan after attaching the ECG Electrodes and marking the arteries followed by blood pressure measurements using the Cardiolab Holter Arterial Blood Pressure Unit. The goal of the Cardio Ox investigation is to determine whether biological markers of oxidative and inflammatory stress are elevated during and after space flight and whether this results in an increased, long-term risk of atherosclerosis risk in astronauts. Twelve crewmembers provide blood and urine samples to assess biomarkers before launch, 15 and 60 days after launch, 15 days before returning to Earth, and within days after landing. Ultrasound scans of the carotid and brachial arteries are obtained at the same time points, as well as through 5 years after landing, as an indicator of cardiovascular health. 
Marrow: FE-5 collected breath and ambient air samples in support of the Canadian Space Agency’s Marrow experiment.  Marrow investigation looks at the effect of microgravity on the bone marrow. It is believed that microgravity, like long-duration bed rest on Earth, has a negative effect on the bone marrow and the blood cells that are produced in the marrow. The extent of this effect, and its recovery, are of interest to space research and healthcare providers on Earth.
Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Piping Replacement: The crew replaced the WHC piping between the pump separator and the dose pump.  This is routine preventative maintenance performed every 6 months. 
All activities were completed unless otherwise noted.
