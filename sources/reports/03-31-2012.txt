ISS On-Orbit Status 03/31/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday.
 
ATV-3 Power Status: ATV-3 power has been successfully reintegrated with ISS power.
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>The lights are on in ATV but the outlets remain unpowered.  The plan is to move forward with the reboost this afternoon.  
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Yesterday, power feed from the ISS SM (Service Module) to ATV-3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) was lost when RECS (Russian Equipment Control System) power channel 1 in the DRS (Docking &amp; Refueling System) Rack located in the ATV failed.  RECS channel 2 was activated, and its integration into the ISS power grid was successfully attempted today at ~12:00pm EDT, taking about an hour.
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>The POTOK air purifier is disconnected from SM power since DRS/RECS failure analysis by ATV-CC (Control Center)/Toulouse has not yet excluded it as a possible cause.  Until then, if POTOK is connected to SM power, ATV will be electrically isolated from SM power. 
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>The crew has almost completed the high-priority cargo transfers started this morning at ~6:00am EDT.  They will complete those operations today.  Later, the status of cargo transfer will be discussed so that the IMS (Inventory Management System) can be updated by the ground.  No further transfer operations will be conducted today, and some planned activities were deferred.  
After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
Ivanishin conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Later, Ivanishin inspected the cultures taken with the ECOSFERA equipment for Stage 1 of the microbial air sampling run for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment on 3/29 from ATV cabin surfaces, logging the results.  The Petri dishes with the cultures had been stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container at +37 deg for incubation.      [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge, the sample collection was being performed in two stages.]
 
FE-5 André Kuipers conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 &amp; O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.
 
André also closed the protective external shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola &amp; JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) window to prevent their contamination from thruster effluents during and after tonight’s ATV3 test reboost (5:54pm EDT).
 
With warmer times approaching in Kazakhstan, Shkaplerov &amp; Kononenko relocated the standard Russian TZK-14 Thermal Protection Jackets (three each) from the Soyuz TMA-03M/29S and Soyuz TMA-22/28S spacecraft to ISS stowage.        [These warm coats, always ready for an emergency return in cold climate, are required to protect the crew after a landing Kazakhstan (or Russia) in winter time.] 
 
Pettit &amp; Kuipers filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Don’s 12<sup>th</sup>, André’s 11<sup>th</sup>.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
FE-1 &amp; FE-5 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Anton at ~8:00am, André at ~10:35am EDT.
 
At ~8:35am, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
At ~9:05am, Burbank conducted the weekly phone conference with the PLUTO (Plug-In Port Utilization Officer) flight control team at MCC-Houston.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).       [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.]

ISS/ATV Test Reboost:   Tonight at 5:54pm EDT, a one-burn ISS test reboost with ATV3 “Edoardo Amaldi” OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters will be conducted for a duration of 6 min 51 sec (351 sec) and a delta-V of 1.0 m/s.  Attitude control authority will be handed over to Russian MCS (Motion Control System) thrusters at ~4:25pm, followed by ISS transition to reboost mode at ~4:54pm.  Attitude control authority returns to US CMG momentum management at ~6:40pm.  Purpose of the reboost is to test the ATV OCS thrusters as well as set up phasing for 28S landing on 4/27.
