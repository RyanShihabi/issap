  FE-6 Fossum’s first 24-hr urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol ended around ~2:00am EDT.  Mike also underwent the associated blood collection of the Generic HRF protocol, with FE-3 Garan assisting with the phlebotomy as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Mike then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to storing them in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS), along with the urine samples and stowed the equipment.       [The operational products for Blood &amp; Urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads have been revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
  At ~7:55am EDT, FE-1 Samokutyayev &amp; FE-4 Volkov conducted a ~1.5-hr debriefing conference with EVA and Orlan specialists on the ground via S-band to discuss spacewalk and Orlan equipment particulars.
 
  Afterwards, Sasha &amp; Sergei worked on drying out the water feed lines and Orlan-MK suits &amp; gloves.
 
  Other post-EVA closeout activities by Volkov &amp; Samokutyayev were –

  In final close-out activities after the EVA-29 spacewalk, CDR Borisenko worked at the SM aft port to re-integrate the Progress M-11M/43P (#411) cargo ship, docked at the port, with the ISS by –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Conducting a leak check on      the SM/43P vestibule,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Opening the SM/SU &amp; SU/43P hatches and      installing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer      mechanism (SSVP)      to rigidize the coupling,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Deactivating the cargo      ship,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Installing the      ventilation/heating air duct, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo3">Dismantling the docking      mechanism (StM,      Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the SM   [StM is the      "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking      assembly (ASA)      with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking      assembly (PSA)      for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted      on the Progress' cargo module (GrO),      while the PSA      sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB and DC-1].</li> </ul> 
  Mike Fossum completed the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 and CGBA-5 payloads in their Lab ERs (EXPRESS Racks).
 
  After configuring the Lab video camcorder for live monitoring of his activities on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), Fossum set up another experiment run on the FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility), ground-assisted by POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center).    [Steps included opening the upper rack door, removing a CIR Manifold Bottle (#2010) with 40% O<sub>2</sub>, 20% CO<sub>2</sub>,&amp; 40% N<sub>2</sub>, and remaining pressure of 293 psia on one of the four manifolds in front of the Optics Bench, and replacing it with a fresh one (#2011), also containing 40% O<sub>2</sub>, 20% CO<sub>2 </sub>&amp; 40% N<sub>2</sub>.  Mike then closed the upper rack doors and informed POIC that the rack was ready for remote commanding.] 
 
  Afterwards, Mike had ~90 min to audit/inventory the contents of the RS (Russian Segment) Streaming Video Cable Kit and CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag) #1122 containing various Photo/TV cables and accessories.
 
  Ron Garan &amp; Satoshi Furukawa joined up for Day 3 of the JEMRMS SFA (Japan Experiment Module Robotic Manipulator System / Small Fine Arm) functional checkout.  With MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder set up to transmit monitor views, FE-5 &amp; FE-3 activated the RLT (Robotics Laptop), CCP (Camera Control Panel) and RMS Monitors and then went through today’s final checkout maneuvers.       [Steps included configuring proper switch settings, activating &amp; starting the JEMRMS ABM (Arm Bus Monitor), maneuvering SFA to the Joint Zeroing Start Position by Joint OCAS (Operator Commanded Auto Sequence) mode.  Next came joint angle zeroing, so that accurate encoder values of the (absolute) joint angles can be monitored, maneuvering MA with SFA to the SFA Function Checkout position, performing the final checkout, then steering MA with SFA to Pre-Berth Position at the SSE (SFA Stowage Equipment).  All equipment was then powered down by Satoshi, including the MPEG video system.  Berthing/installation of the SFA in the SSE is scheduled tomorrow (8/5).]
 
  Ron Garan opened the protective window shutters of Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) so ground images can again be captured by ground commanding.    [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
  Activities completed by Andrey Borisenko included –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4">The periodic transfer of      condensate water to an RS EDV      container for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s      water supply for electrolysis into oxygen &amp; (waste) hydrogen and      filling the designated KOV      (condensate water)      EDV container from CWCs (Contingency Water Containers) #1064 &amp;      #1069; when filled, the EDV      was connected to the BPK      transfer pump for processing through the BKO      water purification (multifiltration) unit  [the 40-minute      procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm      from getting into the BZh      Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles      are detected in the      EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains      five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and      organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters      throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis      in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator],</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4">The      routine daily servicing of the SOZh      system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the      SM    [regular daily SOZh      maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet      facilities, replacement of the KTO      &amp; KBO      solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine      containers and filling EDV-SV,      KOV      (for Elektron), EDV-ZV      &amp; EDV      on RP      flow regulator],</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4">The      daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its      standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the      regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the      ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4">The periodic checkout &amp; performance verification      of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways to ensure      the ventilation/circulation system performs adequately with the six-member      station crew   [inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1], and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo4">Executing the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch      Router) control log to the RSS1      laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA.</li> </ul> 
  Sasha Samokutyayev meanwhile performed the regular inspection of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for presence of coolant fluid.
 
  FE-3 Garan conducted the weekly 10-min. CWC inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.      [The current card (28-0014H) lists 118 good CWCs (2,849.3 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (32 CWCs with 1,347.8 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 872.3 L in 21 bags containing Wautersia bacteria and 390.8 L in 9 clean bags for contingency use;  2. Silver potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (74 CWCs with 1,333.6 L (also 33 expired bags with 603.2 L);  4. condensate water (130.9 L in 9 bags, plus 1 empty bag); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (37.0 L in 2 CWCs, incl. 20.2 L from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
  At ~6:00am EDT, Satoshi had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
  FE-1 &amp; FE-4 conducted their post-EVA PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Sergei at ~12:20pm, Sasha at ~2:35pm.
 
  Shortly before sleep time, CDR Borisenko will set up the Russian MBI-12 Sonokard payload and start another experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
  Due to the shorter workday, the crew worked out a reduced physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-6).
 
 Solar Particle Event:    Early this morning, at ~1:00am EDT, an ESPE (Energetic Solar Particle Event) occurred which is resulting in higher dose rates at brief time intervals today and tomorrow.  Proton levels are above alert condition thresholds, but not high enough to require crew intervention.  Recent passes through the high geomagnetic latitudes, where radiation is enhanced, have not resulted in a perceptible increase in onboard dose as measured by the TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter).
 
 RS Thrusters Inhibit:   Russian attitude thrusters were inhibited from 9:40am – 2:20pm for Progress 43P hatch opening (clamps installation) and JEMRMS SFA operations.
 
  CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were West Cuba (ISS descending pass was at mid-morning with fair weather expected for this target area.  As the station tracked southeastward through the Yucatan Channel, the crew was to look left of track for context views [as the basis for future more detailed imaging] of the complex pattern of mangroves on the southern coast and the intricate shoreline of Cuba and its islands), Santa Barbara Coast, California (the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER [Long Term Environmental Research] site is located in the coastal zone of southern California near Santa Barbara.  It is bounded by the steep east-west trending Santa Ynez Mountains and coastal plain to the north and the unique Northern Channel Islands to the south.  Point Conception, where the coast of California returns to a north to south orientation, lies at the western, and the Santa Clara River the eastern boundary.  ISS descending pass was offshore and in early morning light, but clear weather offered an opportunity for contextual mapping views along this dramatic coast), Hurricane Eugene - Eastern Pacific (Hurricane Eugene is a major hurricane but is beginning to weaken as it tracks west-northwestward in the Eastern Pacific.  At the time of the mid-morning pass it was forecast to be a strong Category 2 storm with 95kt winds.  At this time, looking left of track for context views of this classic, well-formed tropical weather system), and Matavai Bay, Tahiti (HMS Beagle Site:  As ISS approached from the NW in late morning, the crew was to begin looking nadir for the north coast of Tahiti, the largest island and Matavai Bay.  Darwin stopped here in November 1835 near the present capital city, Papeete.  In Darwin's words: " …we landed to enjoy all the delights of the first impressions produced by a new country …  Crowds of men, women &amp; children were collected on the memorable point Venus ready to receive us…" (this was the site where Captain Cook in HMS Endeavour observed the transit of Venus on 3 June1769).  Darwin climbed a narrow river gorge heading towards the central peak of the island, remarking "These precipices must have been some thousand feet high; the whole formed a mountain gorge far more magnificent than anything I had ever beheld."
