NRCSD-19 (NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer – Mission 19): The crew took photos of the four NRCSD-19 Deployments. For NRCSD-19, there are eight Deployers preassembled in two Quad Deployers, and a total of seven satellites will be deployed (SpOC, Bobcat-1, NEUTRON-1, LEMUR2 (v4.7), LEMUR2 (v4.8), DESCENT, and SAT-LLA). The NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer is a stackable, modular, ground loaded launch case. Each NanoRacks CubeSat Deployer accommodates up to six launch cases and are stacked for each JEM Airlock opening. 
Food Acceptability: The crew completed the Questionnaire. This investigation seeks to determine the impact of repetitive consumption of food currently available from the spaceflight food system.  Results will be used in developing strategies to improve food system composition to support crew health and performance on long duration missions.
Systems
Lab Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) Air Selector Valve (ASV) 102 Remove and Replace (R&R): The crew started the R&R of the LAB CDRA ASV 102.  However, the activity was not completed due to schedule constraints. The crew will complete the procedure tomorrow followed by a ground checkout. Node 3 CDRA remains as prime during this time.
Battery Stowage Assembly (BSA) Operation Termination: The crew terminated the Charge-Discharge-Charge (C-D-C) maintenance cycle on all Helmet Lights, PGT Batteries, and two Rechargeable EVA Battery Assemblies (REBA in the BSA and stowed all materials.
Regenerative Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) Recycle Tank Drain/Fill: The crew set up the recycle tank to drain to a ЕДВ-У. Following the setup, the ground performed the tank drain using the Urine Transfer System (UTS). Once the ground specialists completed the transfer, the crew verified the recycle tank was empty, terminated the drain, and repositioned the fill/drain valve to fill.
