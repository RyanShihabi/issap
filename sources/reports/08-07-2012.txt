ISS On-Orbit Status 08/07/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
At wakeup, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Upon wakeup, FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Williams &amp; FE-6 Hoshide completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 27<sup>th</sup> for Joe, the 6<sup>th</sup> for Suni &amp; Aki.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Akihiko Hoshide terminated his first session of overnight recording of his brainwaves with the onboard DK (Diagnostic Kit), then saved and analyzed the EEG (Electroencephalograph) measurements on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.  Before sleeptime tonight, Aki will start the 2<sup>nd</sup> (of 2) overnight EEG measuring of brainwaves.     [Purpose of these activities is to perform diagnostic measurements with medical equipment in order to evaluate the equipment for development of a future diagnostic system on board.  DK includes: Medical laptop, USB Camera, Pulse Oximeter, Stethoscope, Sleep Monitor and Digital Walk Holter/Electrocardiograph and Electroencephalograph (for brain waves).]
 
Sunita Williams terminated her 24 hr-session with a crew-worn acoustic dosimeter, doffing the unit (#1005) and stowing it.
 
FE-2 Revin conducted an audit/inventory of spare Russian SD1 lamp units, going by an uplinked listing to select out and prepack fixtures slated for disposal, and leaving newer ones in stowage after verifying their availability. 
 
Padalka &amp; Malenchenko had ~3 hrs set aside for conducting an ODF (Operations Data File) review of their upcoming Russian EVA-31, scheduled on 8/20, tagging up with ground specialists via S-band. 
 
In Node-3, Aki Hoshide completed the approximately weekly WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.      [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.]
 
Afterwards, Aki terminated Part 1 of his first JAXA BLR48 (Biological Rhythms 48/BIORHYTHMS) experiment on Holter 1, with an Actiwatch with BLR48 software and the medical laptop, then donned Holter 2 for a 2<sup>nd</sup> 24-hrs run.      [Holter exchange was to be completed by 12:10pm.]
 
Later, Hoshide set up the HD (high definition) video camcorder for today’s EPO (Education Payload Operation) demo, then worked with Suni Williams discussing &amp; explaining spatial orientation in orbit, i.e., how there is no up or down while in zero-G.  Aki then stowed the material used for the Demo.
 
Joe Acaba meanwhile spent several hours on IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack).  After configuring the Lab video camcorder for live monitoring of his activities on the Node-1 side of CIR, FE-3 accessed the MDCA (Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus) and made necessary hardware replacements to enable upcoming science operations with FLEX-2 Quiescent &amp; Convective Flow test points.  Acaba then uninstalled &amp; removed the three protective CIR alignment guides to allow ground-commanded micro-G operations.       [Joe gathered the necessary hardware, set up the MDCA CIA (Chamber Insert Assembly) on the MWA (Maintenance Work Area) surface and replaced the igniter tips and Needle 2 inside the CIA.  The latter was then re-installed in the combustion chamber.  Afterwards, the MDCA front-end cap and lower/upper doors were closed, two switches turned on and POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center)/Huntsville notified that the rack was prepared for command on RPC (Remote Power Controller).  CIR/MDCA can now resume science operations.] 
 
Sergei Revin completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
FE-2 also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Later, Sergei performed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
The six crewmembers joined for a one-hour ISS Toxic Emergency OBT (Onboard Training) exercise focusing on how to deal with toxic ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) release, based on new two-part procedures in the 6 onboard EMER-1 Books.  The drill concluded with a 10-min tagup with ground specialists.      [Due to modifications to the RS &amp; ISS auto response programs to preclude spreading the ammonia to the RS, the new procedures require the crew to change to respirators with ammonia cartridges prior to measuring the ammonia contamination level, and to start their NH<sub>3</sub> measurements in the FGB-GA (Pressurized Adapter).  Additionally to the EMER-1 Books, the new procedures are described in 2 books attached to the outside of the AMKs (Ammonia Measurement Kits) which also contain the CMS (Chip Measurement System) with Draeger tubes and hand-pump.]
 
In the US A/L (Airlock), FE-5 Williams cycled the PPRV (Positive Pressure Relief Valve) on EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) 3011, a periodic maintenance task.
 
Also in the A/L, FE-6 Hoshide spent several hours unstowing &amp; removing hardware not needed for the upcoming (8/30) US EVA-18 and preparing the “Quest” A/L to support spacewalk ops.      [Since the A/L CCAA (Common Cabin Air Assembly) is currently working without the LTL (Low Temperature Loop) due to a failed water separator RPC, Aki &amp; Suni had the option to request temporary activation of LTL cooling from the ground.]
 
After configuring the usual pumping equipment (Kompressor-M #41, A8A hose, adapters), Yuri Malenchenko started the transfer of urine from 6 EDV-U containers (#895, #989, #945, #996, #988, #1001) to WDS (Water Distribution System) Tank 2 of ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3).     [Since the ATV3 cabin fan has been switched off since 8/1 in order to preserve its lifetime (until the upcoming O<sub>2</sub> transfer), a continual crew presence in ATV during pumping operation is required for fire detection.] 
 
Later, Yuri concluded his first session with the standard 24-hour ECG (electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2-1 protocol, started yesterday.     [After the ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Yuri doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads over the past 24 hours, recording data on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]
 
Padalka started his 2<sup>nd</sup> session of the standard 24-hour ECG recording under the PZE MO-2-1 protocol which monitors human cardiovascular performance in the space flight environment.       [After 24 hrs of ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed (CDM) system, Gennady will doff the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads and recorded on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results will then be downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data will be downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]
 
Revin broke out and set up the equipment for another session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis, scheduled tomorrow for Gennady, Yuri and himself.        [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s /special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).]
 
Williams reviewed background material on a new run with the JAXA “LEGO Bricks” EPO (Education Payload Activity), scheduled tomorrow for another demo session to build a Lego Bricks Spinner, with talking points.
 
In ESA’s COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-5 afterwards unstowed and set up the VO<sub>2</sub>max (Evaluation of Maximal Oxygen Uptake &amp; Submaximal Estimates of VO<sub>2</sub>max before, during &amp; after long-duration space station missions) hardware for her first session, scheduled tomorrow.      [Both the VO<sub>2</sub>max and Sprint experiments require monthly max tests in-flight, but each use a different protocol to obtain the data.  Joint VO<sub>2</sub>max/Sprint subjects use the VO<sub>2</sub>max protocol.  Suni is performing the VO<sub>2</sub>max protocol and is the last VO<sub>2</sub>max subject.  Aki is performing the Sprint Max protocol and is the first Sprint subject not also participating in VO<sub>2</sub>max.  The Sprint protocol requires less Portable PFS accessory hardware than the VO<sub>2</sub>max protocol.  However, for consistency, both crew will complete the full hardware setup.  Background:  The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System), CEVIS ergometer cycle with vibration isolation, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and other physiological parameters.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
Later, Suni worked in COL on the FSL (Fluid Science Laboratory), installing EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference) filters in the VMU (Video Management Unit).       [During the activity, Suni was mindful not to touch (as much as possible) the very sensitive VMU DLT SCSI (Digital Line Tape Small Computer System Interface) connector.]
 
Gennady had another 1.5 hrs reserved for unloading Progress 48P and transferring cargo to the ISS for IMS-logged stowage.
 
At ~4:25am EDT, Padalka, Malenchenko &amp; Revin supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking greetings and responses to questions from participants of the First International Earth Care Youth Forum being held in GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) in Star City from 8/5-8/9 who visited TsUP-Moscow today.      [Forum cause: Earth is the subject of social assistance from people and humankind as in general; Forum goal:  To combine efforts from children and adults from Planet Earth to take care of our planet.  Delegations from many countries are taking part in the Earth Care forum, including cosmonauts, astronauts, scientists, representatives of various civic organizations, and youth representatives of the planet who are active in various social projects.]
 
CDR, FE-2 &amp; FE-4 had their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Sergei at ~12:00pm, Gennady at ~12:30pm, Yuri ~1:30pm EDT.
 
Before Presleep, FE-3 Acaba turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-4).
 
Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko &amp; Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Locating NASA, JAXA &amp; RKA sleeping bag inserts, listed as stowed in MRM2 Poisk, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).</li></ul> 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today:  Note – As ISS tracks follow the terminator fairly closely there are no static sites that meet illumination requirements today.  However, since dynamic events have different criteria, one such target was submitted for crew consideration:  Hurricane Ernesto, Caribbean Sea (DYNAMIC EVENT:  Looking right for this storm that was expected to reach Category 1 strength by the time of this ISS pass.  Early morning sun and oblique viewing angle should have given opportunities for dramatic images of the cloud tops. The storm is presently expected to cross the Yucatan and continue west).
