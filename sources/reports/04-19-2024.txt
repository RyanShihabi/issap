Boeing Environment Responding Antimicrobial Coatings-2 (AC-2): Routine periodic touching was performed for experiment placards deployed in various locations throughout the ISS. More information on this experiment can be found here.
Cerebral Autoregulation: The Cardiolab Portable Doppler (CDL PDOP) and Laptop were powered up and data measurements were taken. More information on this experiment (Cerebral Autoregulation) can be found here. 
Thigh Cuff: Optical Coherence Tomography 2 (OCT2), ultrasound, and blood pressure measurements were taken. More information on the current experiment (Thigh Cuff) can be found here.

Systems:
Transfer Cargo Dragon Cargo Operations: Today, the crew continued preparing and transferring cargo from ISS to the SpaceX-30 cargo vehicle. SpaceX-30 is scheduled to remain at the ISS until April 26th before it undocks to return cargo and payloads to the ground.
In Flight Maintenance (IFM) Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Manual Fill: As part of regularly scheduled preventive maintenance, the crew performed a manual WHC flush tank fill. By using a post-flight analysis bag to capture any pressure relief, also known as a burp, the crew depressurized the flush water tank and the water valve block to protect the dose pump. This pump is critical as it injects pre-treat required to properly recycle waste urine. 
IFM Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) Inspection: Today, the crew performed an inspection of the ARED Cable Arm Ropes for damage. ARED helps the astronauts maintain muscle strength and mass by incorporating adjustable resistance piston-driven vacuum cylinders along with a flywheel system to simulate free-weight exercises in normal gravity.
