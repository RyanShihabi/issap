All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Day 76 for Williams, Malenchenko &amp; Hoshide.    Saturday – Crew off duty
 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Cycle Shift:  Crew wake-up was at 6:30am, i.e., 4.5 hrs later than usual due to last night’s late turn-in.  With today’s work/rest day shortened by that amount, onboard routine returns to “normal” tonight with a 5:30pm-2:00am EDT sleep period.</li></ul> 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Arrivederci, Edoardo Amaldi! ATV3 (Automated Transfer Vehicle 3) successfully undocked last evening at 5:44pm EDT from the SM (Service Module) aft port where it had been docked for 185 days, after launch on 3/23/12 on an Ariane V.    [For the undocking, ISS attitude control authority was handed over from USOS momentum management to RS (Russian Segment Motion Control System) thrusters at 3:20pm, followed by ISS maneuvering to undock attitude at ~3:25pm.  After going to Free Drift at 5:41pm (to 5:49pm), ATV3 separated at 5:44pm and performed a maneuver burn of 331 s duration, for a delta-V of ~4.0- m/s.  De-orbit will occur on 10/2 (~8:44pm) after renewal of the expired FAA NO-TAM (Notice to Airmen).]
After wakeup, FE-4 Malenchenko performed the routine inspection of the SM PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Yuri also completed the daily reboot of the Russian RS1, RS2, RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops, assisted by Aki Hoshide.
 
CDR Williams had Day 4 of her 4<sup>th</sup> (FD75) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of pH testing. After recording her diet input today, Suni began the urine collections for his Nutrition/Repository/Pro K 24-hour protocol and then prepared the equipment for the associated blood sampling (fasted) tomorrow (9/30), with Pro K photography.       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.]
 
The three crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including all USOS (US Orbit Segment) modules like Lab, Nodes, COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, Yuri Malenchenko completed regular weekly maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of TsV2 fan screens in the FGB plus the grilles of the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System and SKV air conditioner in the SM.
 
Sunita Williams performed regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 &amp; O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.
 
The CDR also opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment and activated the ISSAC laptop, so ground images can be captured by ground commanding.       [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
Yuri supported the overnight test of the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) in the SM by copying the test data collected overnight from the RSE-SLS A31p laptop to the RSS2 laptop for data downlink and log file dump, supported by ground specialist tagup. 
 
Before sleeptime (5:30pm), FE-4 will again start the RSE-SLS A31p laptop for running the TEKh-39 LCS (Laser Communications System, Russian: SLS) overnight during crew sleep.     [Purpose: To conduct another LCS space experiment session (no transmitter activation) of the external BTLS-N (LCS terminal) between 9:30pm-9:53pm and dump the log file.] 
 
After her IFM (Inflight Maintenance) yesterday on the Lab P5 RPCM (Remote Power Controller Module), Suni today removes the unit again and replaces it with a “degraded spare”,- a former Lab RPCM with failed RPC #16 (which would not be needed).      [Yesterday’s installed RPCM drew power but could not be commanded by the ground. If the degraded replacement works, Suni was to close out and stow the removed unit. If it does not work, she needs to repeat the process, with new options worked out by ground specialists by Monday.  Today’s IFM time was “taken” from Suni’s uborka time to preserve her Saturday rest.] 
 
Williams fills out her standard FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MDLT.  It was Suni’s 9<sup>th</sup>.      [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
At ~9:35am EDT, Hoshide, Williams &amp; Malenchenko held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
At ~3:25pm, Sunita is scheduled for her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
The crew works out on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).     [CDR &amp; FE-6 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Suni on Friday, for Aki on Thursday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day. Suni’s protocol for today showed ARED/T2 (continuous), with T2 (interval, 2 min.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.), T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/CEVIS (cont.) and T2 (int., 4 min.) for the next 5 days.  Aki’s protocol for today showed T2 (int., 2 min.), with ARED/T2 (cont.), T2 (int., 30 sec.), ARED/T2 (cont.) and T2 (int., 4 min.) on the following 4 days.]
