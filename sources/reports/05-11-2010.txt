ISS On-Orbit Status 05/11/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Half-duty day for the crew.
 
 At wake-up, FE-1 Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).   [FE-1 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Skvortsov also did the daily morning check on the TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat container and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
 Before breakfast &amp; exercise, CDR Kotov &amp; FE-5 Noguchi each completed a 10-min session with the periodic Russian MedOps test "Hematokrit" (MO-10), which measures the red cell count of the blood, with one of them acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer, Russian: “Examiner”).  It was the second session for Soichi, the third for Oleg.     [The blood samples were drawn from a finger with a perforator lancet, then centrifuged in two microcapillary tubes in the M-1100 kit's minicentrifuge, and its hematocrit value was read off the tubes with a magnifying glass.  It is a well-known phenomenon of space flight that red blood cell count (normal range: 30-45%) tends to go down over time.  After the exam, the data were saved in the IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).]
 
 Noguchi, Creamer &amp; Caldwell-Dyson completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 FE-3 Kornienko took the periodic Russian PZE-MO-3 test for physical fitness evaluation, spending an hour on the TVIS treadmill in unmotorized (manual control) mode and wearing the Kardiokassette KK-2000 belt with three chest electrodes.     [The fitness test, controlled from the RSE-Med laptop, yields ECG (electrocardiogram) readings to the KK-2000 data storage device, later downlinked via the Regul (BSR-TM) payload telemetry channel.  Before the run, the KK-2000 was synchronized with the computer date/time readings.  For the ECG, the crewmember rests for 5 min., then works out on the treadmill, first walking 3 min. up to 3.5 km/h, then running at a slow pace of 5-6 km/h for 2 min, at moderate pace of 6.5 km/h for 2 min, followed by the maximum pace not exceeding 10 km/h for 1 min, then walking again at gradually decreasing pace to 3.5 km/h.]
 
 Later, to get physically ready for his return to gravity on 6/2 with Soyuz 21S, Oleg Kotov completed his first preparatory orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test session with the Russian Chibis suit, conducting the MedOps MO-4 exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill.   With Kornienko acting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer), Oleg was assisted in his 55-min session by ground specialist tagup via VHF at 11:14pm on DO4.  There will be more runs.     [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of Romanenko’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by one cycle of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -30, -35 and -40 mmHg for five min. each, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson spent ~40min familiarizing herself with the use of US camcorders, routing and manipulating MSS (Mobile Service System) and ISS cameras at the Lab RWS (Robotics Workstation).
 
 Afterwards, in the JAXA Kibo laboratory, Tracy changed the power cable of the MMA (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus) by removing the MMA power cable #1 at the Saibo Rack and using it to replace MMA power cable #2 on the Ryutai Rack.  Cable #2 was stowed.     [The cable change is part of a troubleshooting activity looking into the cause of noise contamination on micro-G data acquired by the MMA.]
 
 FE-5 Noguchi set up the equipment for the periodic acoustic measurement protocol, deploying three dosimeters statically, one at the SM Central Post (#1011), one inside the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment, #1012) and the third in Node-3 at midbay (#1013). 
 
 FE-6 Creamer started out with an inspection of MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) equipment, then cleaned out the MSG work volume.
 
 Creamer also removed the KUBIK-3 thermostat-controlled incubator from the FGB and transferred it to the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory).
 
 Later, in Node-2, Timothy reconfigured SSC-20 (Station Support Computer 20), a T61p laptop (#1007), disconnecting its Ethernet and power cables and reconnecting them to the VSW-3 (Video Streaming Workstation 3).     [The subsequent checkout tested the exact video data path from VWS-2 &amp; VWS-3 in Node-2 to SSCs 17 &amp; 18 in the Cupola, preparatory to their use on ULF-4 FD3 (Flight Day 3).  SSC-20 remains in Node-2, for use as wireless SSC in Shuttle Atlantis during ULF-4.] 
 
 In the US A/L (Airlock), Caldwell-Dyson continued preparations for the ULF-4 spacewalks –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Powering on &amp; completing water tank maintenance on EMU #3010 required for on-orbit stowage, by performing half-dump and fill of the suit’s feedwater tanks,</li><li>Conducting the standard one-hour scrub of EMU #3009 cooling loops with their SCUs (Service &amp; Cooling Umbilicals), filtering ionic &amp; particulate matter (via a 3-micron filter), then reconfiguring the cooling loops and starting the ~2hr biocide filtering  [loop scrubbing, incl. iodination of the LCVGs (Liquid Cooling &amp; Ventilation Garments) for biocidal maintenance, is done to eliminate any biomass and particulate matter that may have accumulated in the loops],</li><li>Preparing EVA systems  [i.e., pre-gathering &amp; pre-configuring mesh bags, wrist mirrors, 8 EHIP (EHIP (EVA Helmet Interchangeable Portable) light batteries, 5 PGT (Pistol Grip Tool) batteries, 2 EMU batteries (#2087, #2088), 1 REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly, #1008), etc.], and</li><li>Using a camcorder to record a video tour of the A/L in order to give the ULF-4 EVA crew some familiarization with the current A/L layout.</li></ul> 
 TJ Creamer joined Tracy in the A/L for about an hour to configure EVA tools, i.e., preparing STPs (Safety Tether Packs).    [There will be one complete STP and two 55’ STs (Safety Tethers) prepped for configuring STPs with Shuttle 85’ safety tethers.]
 
 CDR Kotov spent ~1 hr with an OBT (Onboard Training) session for ONS (Off-Nominal Situations) during the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) grappling and transfer of the MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) “Rassvet” after Atlantis arrival, reviewing procedures on the RS2 laptop and tagging up with ground specialists. 
 
 Afterwards, Oleg conducted periodic maintenance on the deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System behind panel 449 by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new unit from FGB stowage (done last: 4/1/10).    [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
 FE-3 Kornienko performed the periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), verifying proper function of its suite by taking readings with the LULIN-5 electronics box, set up in the MRM2 “Poisk” module near the spherical “phantom”.     [Background:  The Matryoshka facility has been used on the ISS for radiation science experiments since 2004, as follows:  MTR-1 was performed outside the ISS/SM with active &amp; passive detectors 2/26/04 – 8/18/05; MTR-2A was performed inside (DC-1), with passive detectors only, 1/5/06 – 12/7/06); MTR-2B was conducted inside the Russian part of the ISS (DC-1 &amp; SM) with active &amp; passive detectors from 10/18/07 – 3//09.  The new Matryoshka-Kibo is the fourth experiment performed with the Matryoshka facility onboard the ISS; it covers for the first time measurements made inside the Japanese Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), complementing the earlier Matryoshka results by adding radiation data acquired during a different phase of the solar cycle.  For Matryoshka-Kibo, a new set of passive dosimeters will be delivered to the ISS on Progress and shortly thereafter installed in the “Phantom” which then will be transferred to its stowage location inside Kibo.] 
 
 Kornienko then worked with Skvortsov in the SM (Service Module) to complete the installation of SUBA IUS/Rate Sensor interface cables, started yesterday, which connect the BSK (Common Power Switching Timer, Blok silovoiy kommutatsii) with other electronics packages such as BSV-M Master Clock, Liulin-MKS electronics unit, BSMM Multiplex Bus Synchronization Unit/computer, BSPN payload server, etc.
 
 Later, Skvortsov &amp; Kotov ran another test of the RS Remote Laptop (#1118) in the US Lab (loc. P5) with its command &amp; data connections to the external SUBA URM-D/Universal Work Platform, installed in 2005 during Russian EVA-12 by Leroy Chiao &amp; Salizhan Sharipov (Exp. 10) on the SM RO (Working Compartment), large diameter.
 
 FE-1 installed the hardware of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 to conduct another observations run of Earth images and spectra, then took down the equipment and stowed it.    [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment is designed for spectral observations of the Earth atmosphere and surface, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
 After setting up the sampling hardware yesterday in the SM with container #6577, Alexander today collected KAV condensate water samples from the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor (water recovery system) upstream of the FGS gas/liquid mixture filter/separator, a periodic check on the performance of the FGS, then removed the sampler and separator and disposed of flush water as per instructions.
 
 After TsUP-Moscow had deactivated the Elektron-VM O<sub>2</sub> generator, BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system &amp; VD-SU control mode, CDR Kotov demated the BPA Nitrogen Purge Unit from the Elektron assembly.
 
 Mikhail Kornienko then performed maintenance on KOB-1 (Loop 1) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, replacing its PST-90 adapter unit with a spare and mating its telemetry connectors.
 
 Afterwards, Misha supported TsUP in reactivating the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator by throwing a switch and monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.    [Measurements were taken twice, 3-4 minutes apart, with the temperature probe of the Elektronika MultiMeter.  If BD temperature exceeded 50 degC, Elektron had to be turned off.  The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]
 
 In the US Lab, Creamer inserted the KFTs (Kennedy Fixation Tubes) from yesterday’s plant harvesting (2) of the APX-C (Advanced Plant Experiments on Orbit-Cambium) experiment in MELFI-2 (Dewar 2/Tray A/Sections 3-4).
 
 Oleg collected &amp; downloaded the periodic sensor readings of the Russian “Pille-MKS” (MKS = ISS) radiation dosimetry experiment which has 12 sensors placed at various locations in the RS (DC1, SM starboard &amp; port cabin windows, ASU toilet facility, control panel, MRM2, etc.), with one, the “duty” dosimeter (A0311), in the Reader.  Today’s readings were taken from all 11 deployed dosimeters, and dose data were logged and called down to TsUP.    [The dosimeters take their readings automatically every 90 minutes.]
 
 In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-5 Noguchi worked on the BLB WAICO-2 (Biolab / Waving &amp; Coiling of Arabidopsis at Different Gravity Levels 2) experiment, removing ECs (Experiment Containers) from incubation, placing ECs on rotor positions for fixation and inserting them for cold stowage in the TCU1 (Temperature Control Unit 1).
 
 Noguchi also serviced the WHC by replacing its PT (Pretreat Tank, #802024) with a new spare (#809036).  
 
 Afterwards, Soichi supplemented the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly / Waste Water Tank) with stored water from an EDV container (#962), emptying it.
 
 FE-3 Kornienko performed the periodic switchover of the Russian STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to an alternate subset, today to the primary string after operating since 5/2 on the backup string.    [The "Voskhod-M" STTS enables telephone communications between the SM, FGB, DC1, MRM2 and USOS (U.S. Segment), and also with users on the ground over VHF channels selected by an operator at an SM comm panel, via STTS antennas on the SM’s outside.  There are six comm panels in the SM with pushbuttons for accessing any of three audio channels (LINE-1,-2,-3), plus an intercom channel (VPU).  Other modes of the STTS include telegraphy (teletype), EVA voice, emergency alarms, Packet/Email, and TORU docking support.]
 
 Misha also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Sasha performed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 At ~10:00am, Oleg, Soichi &amp; TJ tagged up with Houston ground specialists to discuss their latest (5/7) 30-min Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) onboard skill training, where they used D2X digital still cameras with 400 (Oleg) &amp; 800mm (TJ) lenses to take in-cabin target imagery using an Orbiter cutout, and Soichi acting as Timer.    [The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle (STS-132/Atlantis/ULF-4) on 5/16.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Discovery, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
 CDR, FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE-3 had their regular PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Sasha at ~7:50am, Oleg at ~10:50am, Tracy at ~12:55pm, Misha at ~2:15pm EDT.
 
 After Tracy’s ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout) run on the T2 treadmill yesterday, the machine was declared Go by engineers.  For today’s ACO runs by Soichi &amp; TJ, Tracy set up the video equipment to record the sessions for ground review and later took down the equipment.
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1). 
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Pyongyang, North Korea (weather was predicted to be mostly clear over this capital city at the time of this overpass.  Pyongyang is located on the banks of the Taedong River.  Context views of the urban area and surrounding region were requested), Harare, Zimbabwe (looking to the right of track for the capital city of Harare.  The city is the administrative and commercial center of the country.  Short lens views of the urban area and surroundings will provide context for higher resolution imagery), Luanda, Angola (weather was predicted to be mostly clear of the capital city of Angola.  The city is located on the Atlantic coastline of the country and is its chief seaport.  Overlapping frames of the metropolitan area were requested), Dakar, Senegal (Dakar is located on the Cap-Vert Peninsula and is the westernmost city in Africa.  Its position on the Atlantic coast has helped to make it a major regional port.  Overlapping frames of the urban area were requested), and St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda (looking to the left of track for this island capital.  The city is located on the northwestern coastline of the Lesser Antilles island of Antigua.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban area and island were requested).
