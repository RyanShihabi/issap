USOS Extravehicular Activity (EVA) #25: Michael Hopkins (EV1) and Rick Mastracchio (EV2) performed USOS EVA 25 on December 24, 2013. This EVA was the second of two EVAs to replace the degraded S1 Pump Module (PM) that control External Thermal Control System (ETCS) Loop A with a spare PM.  Hopkins attached the four ammonia lines and five electrical connectors to the spare PM without any issues.  The functional test and valve checkout of the new Pump Module was completed. One get-ahead task was performed to retrieve and bring inside a large EVA Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU) bag containing that was left outside during US EVA 23 on July 16, 2013. The crew performed the EMU Contamination procedure using the Contamination Detection Kit (CDK) in the Airlock before fully repressing the airlock and returning into the Crewlock.  No ammonia contamination was detected and USOS EVA 25 concluded at 1:23 PM CST with a PET of 7:30. All EVA equipment performed nominally with no anomalies to report.
