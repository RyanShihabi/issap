Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4): The crew configured the video monitor system and gas system valves in order to prepare the PK-4 chamber for storage. PK-4 is a scientific collaboration between ESA and the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos), performing research in the field of Complex Plasmas: low temperature gaseous mixtures composed of ionized gas, neutral gas, and micron-sized particles. The micro-particles become highly charged in the plasma and interact strongly with each other, which can lead to a self-organized structure of the micro-particles: so-called plasma crystals. Experiments in the facility aim to study transport properties, thermodynamics, kinetics and statistical physics, and non-linear waves and instabilities in the plasmas.
Bio-Monitor: In conclusion of the combined Space Health and Cardiobreath session this week and last week, the Bio-Monitor hardware was stowed. Bio-Monitor is a Canadian onboard instrument that serves as a platform for scientific experiments on the ISS. The instrument performs on-orbit monitoring of crew member physiological parameters, with wearable sensors that only minimally interfere with crew member daily activities. During operation, the crew dons an instrumented garment and headband, and synchronizes the data unit with the controller.

Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation Activities: In preparation for the 1A ISS Roll-Out Solar Array (IROSA) Install EVA on Friday, June 9th, the crew completed EVA procedure reviews, robotics procedure reviews, Equipment Lock (E-LK) preparation, EVA tool configuring, EVA tool audit, Pistol Grip Tool (PGT) Battery Installation, and an EVA procedure conference with the ground. IROSA is a modification to the existing Solar Array Wings (SAWs), providing additional power to the station.
