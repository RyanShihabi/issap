ISS On-Orbit Status 06/07/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.       Underway:  Week 1 of Increment 24.
  
 At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson collected the daily urine pH spot sample for the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) test.      [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.]
 
 Caldwell-Dyson also ended the 24-hr urine collections for her FD60 (Flight Day 60) Nutrition/Repository/Pro K protocol and undertook the associated generic blood sampling protocol, with CDR Skvortsov assisting with the phlebotomy as operator.  Tracy then set up the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) for spinning the samples prior to stowing them in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).
 
 For bioscience sample preservation, FE-2 was to stock MELFI-1 with -32 degC “ice bricks”, retrieving 4 of them for insertion into Dewar 2, Tray C (two bricks each into the two sections of the tray).    [Tray C proved difficult to open, and FE-2 will try again later.]
 
 Afterwards, Tracy worked on the T2 treadmill rack’s laptop, retrieving archived workout data in a batch file and placing them on the T2 display, then transferring them via USB stick to an SSC (Station Support Computer) for downlink.
 
 CDR Skvortsov performed the periodic documentary close-up photography of the two open SKK materials exposure payloads mounted on the outside of the station,- SKK-2 on the “Pirs” Docking Compartment (DC-1) from SM (Service Module) window #6, and SKK-9 on the SM hull from the DC-1 EVA hatch window (VL1), then transferring the digital images to a removable return disk on the RSK-1 laptop.
 
 In the SM, Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko installed a new US-23 Matching Unit/computer and its associated cabling (behind panel 218), supported by ground specialist tagup via S-band.  Purpose of the system: to support the reception of telemetry &amp; medical parameter data from Orlan-MK spacesuits during spacewalks when outside RGS (Russian Groundsite) communication coverage.     [The installation required the temporary power-down of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and VD-SU control mode – which in turn required the deactivation of a number of RS (Russian Segment) systems, including Elektron &amp; the SKV air conditioner, since without BITS their performance cannot be monitored.  After the installation, BITS2-12 and VD-SU were remated/powered up again.] 
 
 For the subsequent reactivation of the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator, Alexander supported TsUP-Moscow by throwing a switch and monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.    [Measurements were taken twice, 3-4 minutes apart, with the temperature probe of the Elektronika MultiMeter.  If BD temperature exceeded 50 degC, Elektron had to be turned off.  The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]
 
 After the recent four-day testing of the ASN-M Satellite Navigation System for its ATV RGPS (Automated Transfer Vehicle Relative Global Positioning System) multipath/interference performance, the CDR reconfigured ASN-M cabling behind SM panels 338 &amp; 228 to restore the system to its nominal state.
 
 FE-2 conducted microbiological sampling, taking surface samples with the SSK (Surface Sample Kit) for incubation and the visual microbial (bacterial &amp; fungal) “T+5 Day” analysis.     [The colony growth on the sampling slides is inspected visually after five days of incubation in Petri dishes, using a procedure to analyze the SSK media slides for bacterial &amp; fungal colony growths.]
 
 Afterwards, Tracy supplemented the WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly / Waste Water Tank) with stored water from an EDV container (#962), emptying it (~40 minutes).
 
 For a ground-controlled leak check of a VES/VRS (Vacuum Exhaust System / Vacuum Resource System) umbilical, Caldwell-Dyson connected the jumper to the VES “waste gas” QD (quick disconnect) at Lab loc. P4, with its other end plugged.    [The VES is the means by which users (payloads etc.) can easily access the vacuum of space.]
 
 Starting a new round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, FE-3 Kornienko inspected &amp; cleaned “Group B1” ventilator fans &amp; grilles in the SM with the vacuum cleaner, then changed out the cartridges of the four dust filters (PF1-4), discarding the used cartridges.
 
 Mikhail also performed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, FGB GA–Node-1, and FGB GA-MRM1.]
 
 The CDR completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Sasha also conducted the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 In preparation for the two ISS reboost maneuvers tonight, FE-2 closed the shutters of the Lab, Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) &amp; Node-3 Cupola windows to protect them against Progress thruster plume effluents.
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2), TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).
 
 At ~5:37am EDT, Tracy powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 5:42am conducted a ham radio session with students from the Technical Industrial State Institute (ITIS) Andrea Ponti, Gallarate, Varese, Italy.     [ITIS was established on October 1, 1959, in Gallarate with a Textile course, at its head office on Giovane Italia square.  From 1961 the school offered Telecommunication.  Later, in 1964, specializations for Industrial Electronics and in 1969-70 Electrotechnics were added.  In 1999 an Aeronautics Constructions course began and in 2004 courses on Industrial Computer Science were introduced.  The school is attended by 1000 students aged 14-19.]
 
 At ~10:30am, Tracy downlinked two PAO TV messages of greetings to the “Summer of Innovation” kickoff at JPL on 6/10 and for generic use by NASA centers &amp; educational institutions.    [In Summer 2010, NASA launches “Summer of Innovation”, an initiative to boost summer learning, particularly for underrepresented students across the nation.  Summer of Innovation supports President Obama’s “Educate to Innovate” campaign for excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM education.  The Summer of Innovation program will work with thousands of middle school teachers and students during multi-week summer programs to engage students in stimulating math- and science-based education programs.  NASA’s goal is to increase the number of future scientists, mathematicians, and engineers, with an emphasis on broadening participation of low-income minority students.]
 
 At ~4:05pm, Tracy is scheduled for her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
 Progress Reboosts:  Two single-burn reboost maneuvers by four Progress 37P mid-ring thrusters will be conducted tonight, one orbit apart, to fine-tune orbital phasing for both 23S Soyuz &amp; 38P Progress launch conditions.
