39 Soyuz (39S) Undock and Landing: Expedition 41 Suraev, Wiseman, and Gerst undocked from the ISS today at 6:31pm CST and landed in Kazakhstan northern landing zone at 9:58pm CST. The crew’s return completes 165 days in space with 2,640 orbits of the Earth.  The 39S undock began Expedition 42 under the command of Samokutyaev, Serova, and Wilmore which will operate the ISS as a three-person crew until the arrival of three additional crew members on November 24th.
Zebrafish: Wilmore captured and prepared the Zebrafish for a live return on the 39S vehicle.  Zebrafish looks at whether atrophy of muscles under the condition of microgravity also occurs in zebrafish and why their atrophy occurs in the microgravity.
Saliva and Blood Collection: Over the weekend, Gerst performed salivary collection and inserted the samples into MELFI for return to ground for analysis.  Wilmore also performed a blood collection for ambient return and analysis. These sample collections were in support of participation in the Human Research Program (HRP) experiments: Biochem Profile, Repository, and Cardio Ox. 
Protein Crystal Growth (PCG) Removal:  Gerst removed and stowed canisters from the Protein Crystallization Research Facility (PCRF) within the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) and placed inside Canister Bags.  The bags were then packed for return on 39S. The High Quality Protein Crystal Growth Experiment (JAXA PCG) is aimed at the growth of crystals of biological macromolecules by the counter-diffusion technique. The main scientific objective of the JAXA PCG experiment is to make the fine quality protein crystals under microgravity environment.
