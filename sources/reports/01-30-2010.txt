ISS On-Orbit Status 01/30/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – crew rest day.
 
 At wake-up, FE-4 Kotov began his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by FE-1 Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 The five-member crew performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
 As part of the house cleaning, Maxim &amp; Oleg conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning on Group E fan screens in SM and TsV2 in the FGB.
 
 CDR Williams completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops.
 
 About 10 min after A31p FS reboot, Jeff also rebooted all T61p ISS servers laptops. 
 
 In preparation of Progress 36P arrival (2/4), Williams installed the alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab to protect the PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) from structural dynamics disturbances.
 
 The CDR filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 FE-6 Creamer took IMV (Intermodule Module Ventilation) flow measurements for specific locations in the SM (Service Module), Lab, Node-2 &amp; Node-1, using the electronic Velocicalc instrument at the various IMV outlets.
 
 Williams, Creamer &amp; Noguchi each performed a VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activity: -
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>After setting up the camcorder for recording video, Jeff reviewed instructions and then conducted the EPO (Educational Program Operations) discussion &amp; demo of “Centripetal Force &amp; Acceleration”, on practical uses of centripetal force &amp; acceleration onboard the ISS  [for example, centrifugal force, i.e. slow crewmember rotation (~15 RPM), is being used in zero-G to “degas” CWCs (Contingency Water Containers) and other water bags];</li><li>TJ worked in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) on the BLB BGB (BIOLAB Bioglovebox), checking leak tightness (hermeticity) of BGB seals and gloves, and</li><li>Soichi set up the MD (Marangoni Deformation) core on the MWA I/F (Maintenance Work Area Interface) B in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), performed a leak check and prepared for a new experiment run by taking out silicone oil from the used MS PTV05 Cassette and supplying it to the MD30 Cooling Disk.</li></ul> 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).
 
 At ~12:25pm, TJ had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
