ISS On-Orbit Status 02/19/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – Crew rest day.  
 
Sleep cycle shift:   Wake – 2:30am; Sleep – 4:30pm (returning to regular)
 
FE-4 Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
Scott Kelly continued his current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Scott’s 8<sup>th</sup> session, transferring data from his Actiwatch to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, US crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
Also at wake-up, CDR Kelly, FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep shift session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 11<sup>th</sup> for Scott, the 12<sup>th</sup> for Cady &amp; Paolo.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Kelly, Kaleri, Skripochka, Kondratyev, Nespoli &amp; Coleman completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of the uborka house cleaning, Sasha, Oleg &amp; Dima conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille and Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM (Service Module).
 
At ~8:30am EST, the Russian Flight Engineers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
In the DC1, FE-2 Skripochka terminated the recharge on the 2<sup>nd</sup> pack of 825M3 EVA batteries.
 
FE-5 Nespoli updated his daily diet log for his 4<sup>th</sup> six-day session for the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment, which entails diet intake loggings (low salt diet), body mass measurements and blood &amp; urine samplings.       [SOLO is composed of two sessions of six days each.  From Day 1 to 5 (included) Paolo ingested a special High Salt diet (which corresponds to normal ISS diet salt level), for Session 2 he switched to a Low salt diet.  SOLO Diets start with breakfast on Day 1. Day 6 of each session is diet-free.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged daily on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  Body mass is measured with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) on Days 4 &amp; 6.  Blood samples are taken on Day 5, centrifuged &amp; inserted in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also measured with the PCBA.  24-hr urine collections are performed on Day 5, with sample insertion in MELFI.    Background:   SOLO, a NASA/ESA-German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
Kelly, Coleman &amp; Nespoli reviewed uplinked “Big Picture” material on the upcoming robotics activities during the ULF5 docked period, followed at ~11:00am EST by the first of several planned STS-133/ULF5 crew conferences.     [At STS-133 arrival, the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) will be based on Node-2, the SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) on the Lab with CTC (Cargo Transport Container) being held by Arm 1, and FHRC (Flex Hose Rotary Coupler) located on the SPDM’s EOTP (Enhanced ORU Temporary Platform), and the MT (Mobile Transporter) is at WS3 (Workstation 3).  Node-1 nadir ACBM (Active CBM) survey and CBM (Common Berthing Mechanism) checkout will be complete.  After a final SRMS (Shuttle Remote Manipulator System) checkout after STS-133 launch, ELC4 will be unberthed &amp; transferred on docking day (FD3/Flight Day 3).  EVA-1 will take place on FD5.  ON FD6, PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) will be unberthed and installed, followed by EVA-2 on FD7.  The Fly-About of Soyuz 24S for special external documentary/historical photography is planned for 3/5, i.e., FD10 (in the +1 day scenario) based on a 2/24 launch.]
 
After the final repress of the ISS stack with ~26.5 lbs of O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) from Progress M-09M/41P (#409), Skripochka purged &amp; inerted the cargo ship’s SrPK (air supply tankage) Section 2 by charging it with N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen).    [41P is scheduled for undocking on 4/26.]
 
Kaleri meanwhile worked on the Vozdukh carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) scrubber, replacing the CO<sub>2</sub> filter of its delta gas analyzer with a new spare.  The old unit was discarded as trash.
 
Scott Kelly completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router &amp; FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops (the latter required to mitigate the problem of iPV and OSTPV not opening up procedures due to a memory leak in the “Tomcat” software).  After a period of no less than 10 min later, the CDR also rebooted the two ISS network servers (SERVER1 &amp; 2).
 
Dmitri Kondratyev conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
At ~6:45am EST, Nespoli powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 6:50am conducted a ham radio session with students at “Imparare Sperimentando” (Experiencing Learning ) in San Quirino, Italy.
 
At ~9:05am, Kaleri, Skripochka &amp; Kondratyev downlinked messages of greetings &amp; well-wishing to participants at two separate events,- (1) the 6<sup>th</sup> Congress of the Russian Federation of Cosmonautics on 2/25, this year dedicated to Yuri Gagarin, and (2) the traditional “Ice Show” at Kaluga on 3/11-13, held by the Regional Welfare Funds “Vozrozhdenie” (renaissance, revival) dedicated to Yuri Gagarin’s birthday and the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of his space flight as first human.
 
At ~11:40am, Alex, Oleg &amp; Dmitri engaged in a PAO phone interview via S-band with Ekaterina Beloglazova, Editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos Magazine and an old friend of ISS cosmonauts. 
 
At ~3:50pm, Scott Kelly is scheduled for his regular weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4).      [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.       [The new card (26-0045I) lists 113 CWCs (2,302.6 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (18 CWCs with 716.5 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 388.5 L in 10 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 170.8 L in 4 bags for transfer into EDV-RP containers via US/RSA-B hose, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only;  2. potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (83 CWCs with 1,537.3 L for reserve, of which 271.9 L in 15 CWCs are listed as “expired”;  4. condensate water (22.9 L in 2 bags, with 6.3 L in 1 bag to be used only for OGA, plus 8 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (25.9 L in 2 CWCs from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
Progress 39P Undocking:   Progress M-07M/39P undocking is scheduled tomorrow morning at 8:12am EST.  Russian thrusters will be disabled from 8:08am-8:14am.  After separation, from 8:17am-8:22am, U.S CMGs (Control Moment Gyroscopes) will maneuver the ISS to its post-undock TEA (Torque Equilibrium Attitude).  39P deorbit burn to destructive re-entry  is scheduled tomorrow at ~11:12am.
