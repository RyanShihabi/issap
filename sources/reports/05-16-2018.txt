US EVA 50 Pump and Flow Control Subassembly (PFCS) Relocate: Today Drew Feustel (EV-1) and Ricky Arnold (EV-2) executed US EVA #50. The following tasks were accomplished during the EVA:

A swap of the Pump/Flow Control Subassemblies (PFCS) between the Enhanced ORU Transfer Platform (EOTP) and External Stowage Platform (ESP)-1 locations
Removal and Replacement (R&R) of the Camera Port #13 (CP13) External Television Camera Group (ETVCG)
R&R of the degraded Space to Ground Transmitter Receiver Controller (SGTRC)
Installation of the S1 forward and aft RGB T-handles
S1-FHRC strut preps
ELC2 spare DCSU MLI removal and MLI skirt tie backs

The Phase Elapsed Time (PET) for US EVA #50 was 6h 31m. 
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: This afternoon & evening, robotics controllers are performing post-EVA operations to unstow the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) with the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).  Once the SPDM is unstowed, the MT will be translated from Worksite (WS) 6 to WS 8 in preparation for tomorrow night’s transfer and install of the spare Pump Flow and Control Subsystem (PFCS) from the SPDMs Enhanced ORU Temporary Platform (EOTP) to the P6 long spacer.  These activities will allow ground controllers to gain insight into the PFCS to perform a firmware update and a Flow Control Valve (FCV) functional checkout.
