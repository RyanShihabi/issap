ISS On-Orbit Status 10/21/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
 
 At wake-up, FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 CDR Wheelock serviced &amp; prepared Actiwatches for another round of the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight).      [Steps included setting up the HRF PC 1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1) laptop &amp; Actiwatch Reader, replacing lithium batteries in the Actiwatches where required, performing data downloading and initializing the devices, finally decabling &amp; stowing the hardware and powering the PC off.]
 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin had 2h 50m reserved for doing his 5<sup>th</sup> onboard session of the Russian biomedical MBI-15 "Pilot-M"/NEURO signal response experiment after setting up the workplace and equipment, assisted by Skripochka.  Later, the Pilot-M &amp; Neurolab-2000M gear was disassembled &amp; stowed away, data files were downloaded, and Fyodor reported to TsUP on his run.     [MBI-15 requires the Multipurpose Hardware Bench as a table, ankle restraint system, eyeball electrodes for an EOG (electrooculogram), and two hand controllers (RUO &amp; RUD) for testing piloting skill in “flying” simulations on a laptop (RSK1) with software (v. 2.0) under stopwatch control, as well as for studying special features of the psychophysiologic response of cosmonauts to the effects of stress factors in flight.]
 
 Later, Fyodor undertook a session with the MedOps protocol MO-5, “Cardiovascular Evaluation during Graded Exercises” on the VELO cycle ergometer, a standard Russian fitness test, assisted by Alex Kaleri as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).     [The 50-min assessment, supported by ground specialist tagup via VHF and telemetry monitoring (11:45am EDT), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels.  For the graded exercise, the subject works the pedals after a prescribed program at load settings of 125, 150, and 175 watts for three minutes each.  Data output involves a kinetocardiogram, rheoplethysmogram, rheoencephalogram and a temporal pulsogram.]
 
 In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Shannon Walker continued her support of the JAXA experiment HydroTropi (Hydrotropism &amp; Auxin-Inducible Gene Expression in Roots Grown under Microgravity Conditions).  The current experiment will run until 10/22 (tomorrow).       [After retrieving 3 KFTs (Kennedy Fixation Tubes) from MELFI 2 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 2) Dewar 3/Tray B/ Sect. 3,4 (+2 degC) and conducting a leak check of the Glutaraldehyde Paraformaldehyde fixative KFTs, Shannon detached 2 MEUs B (Measurement Experiment Units B) from the CBEF IU 1G (Cell Biology Experiment Facility Incubator Unit for 1G), fixated the samples and returned the KFTs with the samples to MELFI for storage.  Next, FE-6 watered 4 HydroTropi chambers, transferred them to 4 MEUs B and inserted these for incubation in CBEF IU 1G.]
 
 Shannon also performed the regular camera setup status check on the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) with Sample 8, done two days after initializing, plus today replacing the flash battery with a new one and taking photos of the position of the flash and the sample module in all three axes.
 
 Later, Walker undertook the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, going through a 30-min. exercise to refresh her CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support).  [Objective of this exercise is re-familiarization with the RSP (Respiratory Support Pack), AED (Automated External Defibrillator), and CMRS (Crew Medical Restraint System).  The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] 
 
 Kaleri &amp; Yurchikhin serviced the running experiment TEKh22/IDENTIFIKATSIYA in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet by downloading structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 A31p laptop (last time done: 10/11).
 
 Skripochka &amp; Kaleri , with TsUP support, conducted the standard 30-min intermodular space-to-space (wireless) test of the TORU teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system, i.e., between the TORU control station in the SM and the Progress 39P, docked at SM (Service Module) aft.  Progress DPO (Approach &amp; Attitude Control) thrusters were not commanded.  The test was performed on DO1 at 1:00pm-1:35pm EDT.    [TORU is the manually teleoperated backup approach and docking system for the automated Progress ships.] 
 
 Doug Wheelock, assisted by Scott Kelly, had ~3 hrs set aside for transferring the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) from COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) loc. F2 (Floor 2) to the U.S. Lab, loc S1 (Stbd 1).    [With the MSG gone, the fireport tables for COL include a fireport that no longer exists there.  Fireports are openings in console and wall panels for fire extinguisher nozzle insertion to reach behind-panel space.]
 
 FE-3 Kelly filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 Afterwards, Scott also performed his first onboard session with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.     [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
 Wheelock &amp; Kelly both went through the CBT (computer-based training) session for the new 24S-delivered HMS (Health Maintenance System) Tonometry hardware &amp; procedures, then verified Tonometer equipment functionality &amp; readiness in microgravity by performing individual eye pressure measurements on an eye simulator.      [Tonometer measurements in micro-G will be used to assess the health of the crew’s eyes.] 
 
 With a new EDV-U container in the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), FE-3 performed the reconnecting of the WHC from backflow back to feeding the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) and reported the flush counter.
 
 Kelly also completed the visual T+2 Days (44 ± 4h) microbial (bacterial &amp; fungal) analysis of SM (Service Module) &amp; PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) water samples collected by Shannon on 10/19 for the “Week 4” assessment, using the WMK MCD (Water Microbiology Kit / Microbial Capture Devices) for microbial traces, and the CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for inflight coliform indications (Magenta for Positive, Yellow for Negative).
 
 Because the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer) analysis of the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser terminated early on 10/19, Scott today had to prime the TOCA fluid line, using water from the WPA and buffer solution from the TOCA buffer container.
 
 Kelly also completed servicing the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) galley fridge, today installing 2 fresh desiccant packs after letting the cooler dry out for 24 hrs.    [MERLIN is used for cold storage of crew food and drink.]
 
 Wheels completed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.    [The new card (25-0001A) lists 122 CWCs (2,765.5 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (24 CWCs with 998.2 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 712.7 L in 17 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 128.3 L in 3 bags for flushing only with microbial filter, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only; 2. potable water (4 CWCs with 171.8 L, of which 1 bag with 42.5 L is to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use;  3. iodinated water (84 CWCs with 1,548.2 L for reserve;  4. condensate water (10.6 L in 2 bags, with 6.3 L to be used only for OGA, plus 6 empty bags; and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (30.4 L, in 1 CWC with 20.2 L from hose/pump flush &amp; 10.2 bag with 2.00 L from EMU dump).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin performed periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), collecting eight Bubble dosimeters (A21-A28) and reading their recorded radiation traces in a special Reader.    [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]
 
 At ~8:35am EDT, Wheelock, Kelly &amp; Walker tagged up with the STS-133/ULF5 crew and ground specialists via audio linkup to discuss cargo transfer during the ULF5 docked phase.     [Attending on the ground were STS-133 crewmembers Steve Lindsey, Eric Boe, Alvin Drew, Tim Kopra, Mike Barratt &amp; Nicole Stott, and the transfer ground team of Liz Antognoli (lead), Lisa Milam &amp; Jacalyn Poteraij.]
 
 At ~9:05am, Wheels, Scott &amp; Shannon talked with the ULF5 crew and the EVA ground team via audio to discuss the two ULF5 spacewalks.      [Points of discussion included ULF5 EVA overview, EMUs/Stowage, roles during EVA Prep &amp; Post EVA, and safety notes.  The EVAs will be conducted by Alvin Drew &amp; Tim Kopra.  Discovery will deliver two new EMU/spacesuits for use on this mission, then return them to Earth.  Objectives of EVA1, on FD5 (Flight Day 5), will be: J612 extension cable installation, Pump Module retrieval &amp; stowage on ESP2, CP3 camera wedge installation, starboard CETA rail stub installation &amp; stowage of S3 tether shuttle stop &amp; MT stop (get ahead), and collecting “Space” for “Message in a Bottle” (JAXA).   On EVA2 (FD7), Kopra &amp; Drew will vent the Pump Module on ESP2, retrieve &amp; install LWAPA into Payload Bay, remove ELC4 ExPCA MLI, retrieve jettison stowage bag, install P3 CETA light, reconfigure P1 RBVM bootie, troubleshoot P1 radiator grapple stow beam, remove Node-3 MLI, and install SPDM CLPA2 lens cover and POA CLA lens cover.]
 
 FE-6 Walker set up the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) for its subsequent grapple maneuver at Node-2, by –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Connecting the Lab RWS DCP (Robotics Workstation Display &amp; Control Panel) bypass cable,</li><li>Connecting the Cupola RWS DCP bypass cable,</li><li>Installing the CRA (Crew Restraint Assembly) in the Cupola (which enables crewmembers to work at the CUP RWS without floating away - but involves a hatch drag-thru),</li><li>Configuring the cabling between the DOUG SSC (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics Station Support Computer) and PCS (Portable Computer System) laptops,</li><li>Reviewing times for SSRMS Ops and DOUG software startup to receive telemetry during Ops, and</li><li>Checking out the RWS in preparation for ULF5. </li></ul> 
 Afterwards, Shannon &amp; Scott maneuvered the SSRMS to grapple the Node-2 PDGF (Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture).
 
 In the Lab, Kelly terminated the regeneration “bake-out” on the first set of METOX (Metal Oxide) cans and initiated it on the second set.     [METOX canisters are CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon Dioxide) absorption/removal devices which can be reused by “baking out” the CO<sub>2</sub> to vacuum.]
 
 Before sleeptime, Scott is to break out and set up the equipment for his first blood sample collection tomorrow under the Nutrition/Repository/Pro K generic blood collection.
 
 Fyodor performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Oleg completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance by updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Skripochka also conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, DC1–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 Afterwards, FE-2 collected &amp; downloaded the periodic sensor readings of the Russian “Pille-MKS” (MKS = ISS) radiation dosimetry experiment which has 11 sensors placed at various locations in the RS (DC1, SM starboard &amp; port cabin windows, ASU toilet facility, control panel, MRM2, etc.), plus one, the “duty” dosimeter, in the Reader.  Today’s readings were taken from all 11 deployed dosimeters, and dose data were logged and called down to TsUP.  The dosimeters were then re-deployed and the flashcard replaced.     [The dosimeters take their readings automatically every 90 minutes.]
 
 At ~1:30pm EDT, Wheels had his weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-5/MO-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 ISS Reboost:    A one-burn reboost of ISS was performed yesterday at 3:41pm EDT using the Progress 39P DPO rendezvous &amp; docking thrusters.  The 3m49s-duration burn generated a delta-V of 0.5 m/s and raised the ISS mean altitude by approximately 890 m.  This reboost places the ISS in the proper phasing attitude and altitude for Progress 40P launch on 10/27 and consecutive FD3 launch opportunities for STS-133/ULF5 starting on 11/1.  It is also the first of two reboosts to set up conditions for Soyuz 23S landing on 11/30.
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Canberra, Australia (this nadir pass over Australia’s capital city provided an opportunity to acquire a southwest to northeast transect across the metropolitan area.  Nadir imagery of the rural-urban fringe transition zones is of particular interest), Sydney, Australia (shortly after leaving Canberra, the orbit track brought ISS over the most populous city in Australia.  Similarly to the Canberra target, a nadir image transect across the metropolitan area and into the harbor was requested), and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (HMS Beagle site.  Looking right of track for Rio’s prime visual cue, Guanabara Bay.  Darwin undertook an expedition inland from Rio, presently a city of more than 7 million).
