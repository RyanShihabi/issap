ISS On-Orbit Status 02/01/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Underway: Week 10 of Increment 22
 
 At wake-up, FE-4 Kotov began his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-1 Suraev’s morning inspection today included the periodic checkup behind ASU panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
 Suraev also completed the periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), recording data from detectors in the Bubble dosimeter reader and re-deploying the dosimeters.    [Eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (A01-A08) are positioned at their exposure locations around the RS.  An additional eight detectors (A09-A16) were collected by Maxim from their location at the spherical “Phantom” unit in the DC1 Docking Compartment where he had placed them on 1/26, and their accumulated measurements recorded on a memory card in the Bubble-dosimeter Reader.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]
 
 In the SM, Maxim performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), CDR Williams began his 4<sup>th</sup> (of 5) Ambulatory Monitoring session of the ESA ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) experiment, preparing the two Actiwatches, electrode sites, attaching the harness and donning the Cardiopres, assisted by FE-6 Creamer as Operator.     [ICV activities consist of two separate but related parts over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  Today, wearing electrodes, the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) for recording ECG (Electrocardiogram) for 48 hours, the ESA Cardiopres to continuously monitor blood pressure for 24 hours, and two Actiwatches (hip/waist &amp; ankle) for monitoring activity levels over 48 hours, Jeff started the ambulatory monitoring part of the ICV assessment.  During the first 24 hrs (while all devices are worn), ten minutes of quiet, resting breathing are timelined to collect data for a specific analysis.  PGT (Pistol Grip Tool)/Makita batteries were switched as required.  The nominal exercise on the CEVIS machine includes at least 10 minutes at a heart rate ≥120 bpm (beats per minute).  After 24 hrs, the Cardiopres is doffed and the HM2 HiFi CF Card and AA Battery are changed out to allow continuation of the session for another 24 hours.  After data collection is complete, the Actiwatches and both HM2 HiFi CF Cards are downloaded to the HRF PC1, while Cardiopres data are downloaded to the EPM (European Physiology Module) Rack and transferred to the HRF PC1 via a USB key for downlink.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months). The FD75 echo scan will include an exercise component with a second scan (subset of the first) completed within 5 minutes after the end of exercise.]
 
 Williams, Creamer &amp; Noguchi took the periodic O-OHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, a 30-min NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures, using a special software application on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.     [The O-OHA audiography test involves minimum audibility measurements for each ear over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, with the crewmembers using individual-specific Prophonics earphones, new Bose ANC headsets (delivered on 30P) and the SLM (sound level meter).  To conduct the testing, the experimenter is supported by special EarQ software on the MEC, featuring an up/down-arrow-operated slider for each test frequency that the crewmember moves to the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The baseline test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per month.  Note: There have been temporary hearing deficits documented on some U.S. and Russian crewmembers, all of which recovered to pre-mission levels.]
 
 TJ Creamer unstowed, configured and activated the U.S. EarthKAM (EK) hardware in Node-2 for a new session, powered by a Ku-band power supply unit relocated from the US Lab to Node-2 beforehand (1/28).  Last time done: 10/19/09.   [For focusing the camera, TJ had to see the ground, i.e., during orbit day.  EK is using a DCS 760 electronic still camera with 50mm (f/1.4) lens at the Node-2 window, powered by 16Vdc from a 28V DC adapter, taking pictures by remote operation from the ground, without crew interaction.  EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) is an education program that enables thousands of students to photograph and examine Earth from the unique perspective of space, integrating the excitement of ISS with middle-school education.  The student requests are uplinked in a camera control file to an A31p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop which then activates the camera (wireless) at specified times and receives the digital images from the camera’s storage card on its hard drive, for subsequent downlink via OPS LAN.]
 
 Afterwards, the FE-6 set up, checked out and conducted his second test run with the French/CNES neuroscientific research experiment “3D Space” (SAP) as Subject #7, while free-floating, using the ESA MPPL (Multipurpose Laptop) with a prepared HDD (Hard Disk Drive), data storage on a PCMCIA memory card, and an electronic pen table connected to it.     [3D Space, which involves distance, writing and illusion exercises, is designed to test the hypothesis that altered visual perception affects motor control.  To do this, the subject is asked to reproduce shapes or text on an electronic pen pad (Wacom Intuos3 A4).  The test person is asked to reproduce shapes or text on the pen tablet which allows researchers to record and analyze the reactions both on earth and in space.]
 
 FE-5 Noguchi initiated (later terminated) another 5-hr sampling run (the 66<sup>th</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer).  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.    [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 In the USOS (US Segment), TJ Creamer had ~1h50m to remove the degraded WPA (Water Process Assembly) Pump/Separator ORU (Orbital Replacement Unit) in the WRS2 (Water Recovery System 2) Rack and replace it with a new unit.    [The activities included rotating the rack down to provide access (~20 min), exchanging the ORU (~40 min.) and rotating the rack up again plus closeout (~50 min). The old unit was degraded due to suspected clogging at the inlet to the MLS (Mostly Liquid Separator) within the pump separator, which has caused MLS low pressure readings, causing early shutdown of processing runs.  The WPA, which has been inactive since 1/19, will be reactivated on 20A after installation of a filter assembly between the waste water tank and the pump separator.] 
 
 Continuing yesterday’s troubleshooting activity on the MD (Marangoni Deformation) payload in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Soichi Noguchi performed silicone oil leak check #3 on the MD cooling disk.    [If a silicone oil leak was found, the MD30 Core was to be stowed in its CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag) with foam or bubble wrap for return.]
 
 Soichi also performed the periodic maintenance &amp; visual inspection of the ARED (advanced resistive exercise device) rails &amp; rollers, greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails &amp; rollers and evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.
 
 Later, the FE-5 undertook another periodic relocation of the TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly, the primary radiation measurement tool in the ISS, moving it from Node-2 (P3/4) to Kibo JPM (F2/FD3).    [The UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) a1, port J3 on JPM1FD2 is being used as power plug-in.]
 
 Oleg Kotov terminated the recharge of the DZZ-13 battery (AIP-01), initiated yesterday, and then conducted two sun-glint observation sessions with the new Russian DZZ-13 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) science experiment (at 6:20am-6:40am &amp; 9:25am-9:35am EST), supported by ground specialist tagup and using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor) from SM window #2 and later downlinking data.  The equipment was then re-stowed.     [RUSALKA ops involve calibration and tests of research equipment relating to the Sun and the Earth's limb at sunset (atmosphere lighted).  To be tested are the procedure for remote determination of Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) &amp; Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) content in the atmosphere (in the First Phase), measurement of CH<sub>4</sub> &amp; CO<sub>2</sub> content in the atmosphere and reception of data on NI2 and NI4 content over the territories subjected to natural and technogenic effects, reception of sufficient data on seasonal dependencies of tropospheric parameters being studied (in the Second Phase).  Equipment used:  Rusalka monoblock, Nikon D2X(s) digital photo camera; AF VR Nikkor ED 80-400f/4.5-5.6D lens with ultraviolet filter, bracket for attachment to the window, and Rusalka-Accessories set.  Support hardware: Device TIUS /DKShG/PNSK, Laptop RSK1, and Software Package loading disk.]
 
 Jeff &amp; TC went on a search for “lost” LTA (Lower Torso Assembly) restraint straps.    [The LTA restraint straps are used to attach the Lower Torso Assembly to the EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units).  Without the straps, bundling the EMU will be more difficult prior to transfer to COL.]
 
 The CDR checked out the US SLM (Sound Level Meter) instrument and then used it to capture acoustic readings of the T2/COLBERT treadmill, taking noise level measurements of T2 while it was both inactive and in use by Soichi Noguchi, at different speed settings.  SAMS ICU (Space Acceleration Measurement System Interim Control Unit) in the Lab (EXPRESS Rack 1/Drawer 2) was also activated.    [Recorded data were later transferred to the MEC and downlinked to help determine if the crew will continue having to wear hearing protection during their exercise sessions.]
 
 Jeff Williams &amp; Nicole Stott reviewed RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) ops procedures, tagging up with ground specialists at ~10:15am EDT to discuss the results of their second (10/22) RPM photo drill.    [The RPM flip-over is used by the crew for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle next month.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Atlantis, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
 At ~1:30pm, Jeff, Oleg &amp; Soichi tagged up with ground specialists via audio/phone to discuss the results of their last RPM (R-Bar Pitch Maneuver) photo/TV drill.    [The RPM flip-over is used by the crew for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at the arrival of the Shuttle next month.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Atlantis, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
 At ~2:45am EST, the CDR, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 conducted a teleconference with ground specialists to discuss 20A cargo transfer operations and an uplinked draft equipment transfer list.
 
 At ~5:45am, Noguchi held an audio/video tagup with the Japanese Flight Control Team (ARIES/J-PAYLOADS) at SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center)/Tsukuba to discuss stowage requirements and future trash disposition issues.
 
 At ~10:10am, Weaver, Williams &amp; Noguchi supported an educational PAO/TV event with K-12 grade students at Troy School District in Troy, Michigan.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR/ICV), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).
