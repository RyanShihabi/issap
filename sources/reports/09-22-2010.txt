ISS On-Orbit Status 09/22/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   The day before Soyuz 22S departure. 
 
 FE-3 Kornienko conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Upon wakeup, FE-6 Shannon Walker &amp; FE-4 Doug Wheelock performed their 4<sup>th</sup> liquid and first dry saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE biomed protocol.       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of t he liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
 Also upon wake-up, FE-6 Walker performed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol and FE-4 Wheelock took documentary photography of the test.       [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the daily temperature check of the Russian experiment BTKh-10/KONYUGATSIYA (Conjugation), currently installed in the TBU thermostat-controlled incubator at +29 degC, and reported the temperature to TsUP-Moscow.
 
 Also at day’s begin, FE-5 Yurchikhin terminated his 7<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 CDR Skvortsov activated and checked out communications from the Soyuz TMA-18/22S spacecraft.
 
 Later, he &amp; Mikhail Kornienko had another ~3-4 hrs each for prepacking and stowing cargo for return and for disposal on Soyuz 22S.     [Return cargo was stowed in the SA/Descent Module, trash &amp; excessed equipment in the BO/Orbital Module (which will be jettisoned for incineration during the reentry of the spacecraft).]
 
 Afterwards, Alex uninstalled &amp; removed the LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard measurement telemetry from 22S, along with its ROM unit (read-only memory, TA765B), for spares storage and re-use,
 
 Final payload transfers to the 22S SA by Kornienko, with photography by Yurchikhin, involved the science experiments BTKh-35 MEMBRANA (Membrane), BTKh-5 LAKTOLEN, BTKh-8 BIOTREK, and BTKh-41 BAKTERIOFAG
 
 Later, FE-3 used the standard ECOSFERA equipment, to conduct microbial air sampling runs for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment, with the POTOK Air Purification System temporarily powered down, taking Kit 2 samples from cabin surfaces along with samples from crewmembers for sanitation and disease studies.  The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container and subsequently packed for return in Soyuz 22S.  Part 1 of MO-21 protocol was done yesterday.      [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.]
 
 Kornienko &amp; Yurchikhin also conducted the MO-22 Sanitary-Epidemiological Status check, part of the Russian MedOps program done usually before Soyuz departures.     [To monitor for microflora, Mikhail &amp; Fyodor collected samples from surface areas of interior panels and hardware at various places in the SM (Service Module), FGB, and MRM2, also from each other, using cotton swabs and special test tubes which were then stowed in 22S for return to the ground.]
 
 In addition, Mikhail performed air sampling, employing the Russian AK-1M adsorber in the SM and FGB, as well as the IPD-CO Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (Carbon Monoxide).  The samplers were stowed on 22S for return to Earth.
 
 In preparation for their return to gravity tomorrow night, Sasha &amp; Misha undertook the second session of their 5<sup>th</sup> and final training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the Russian VELO ergometer, assisting each other as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  The activity was then closed out.      [The assessments, lasting one hour each, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground sites (at 5:54am &amp; 7:29am EDT), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -20, -25, -30, and -35 mmHg for five min. each, then -25, -30, and -35 mmHg (Torr) for 10 min. each plus 30mmHg for 5 min. while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin, FE-4 Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker, the three crewmembers remaining onboard after Soyuz 22S departure, joined up in the Soyuz 23S spacecraft (docked at the MRM1 Rassvet module) for the standard 3-hr Soyuz Emergency Descent Drill, a regular procedure for each station crew.  The exercise, which does not involve any command activation, uses computer simulation (Trenasher Spusk/”descent trainer”) on the RSK1 laptop, with a descent hand controller (RUS) in manual mode to set up reentry conditions and switch between modes.    [The onboard training (OBT) session, supported by TsUP instructor tagup, included a review of the pertinent RODF (Russian Operations Data Files), specifically the books on Soyuz Insertion &amp; Descent Procedures, Emergency Descents, and Off-Nominal Situation Procedures such as manual undocking.]
 
 FE-2 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson completed a number of activities, including –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later  [This was the 25<sup>th</sup> session with the GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 100 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],</li><li>The periodic status check &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) payload in the Lab,</li><li>Collecting a 60mL water sample from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) and SM SVO-ZV water supply, after hose purging, and completing the Iodine and Silver analysis of the samples [data were downloaded afterwards and the CWQMK (Colorimetric Water Quality Monitoring Kit) stowed.]</li><li>Removing the portside &amp; overhead “bump-out” structural elements in Node-2 preparation for the subsequent CQ3 (Crew Quarters 3) installation by Wheels,</li><li>Supporting payload ground controllers by powering up, later turning off, the SpaceDRUMS/SDRM (Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix System) payload [supporting the ground to continue verification with manual testing of the MHS (Material Handling System).  Manual operations will focus on extracting pellets from the pellet storage carousel and returning pellets to the pellet storage carousel.  The feasibility of manual operation of the MHS for manual processing of pellets is now being evaluated], and</li><li>The regular re-calibration of the two hand-held CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (CSA-Oxygen) instruments #1041 and #1045, the 8<sup>th</sup> calibration after their delivery on Mission 20A.  (Done last: 8/31).</li></ul> 
 FE-4 Wheelock, in parts assisted by FE-6 Walker, transferred the CQ3 rack from the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) rack from the JPM (loc. D3) to Node-2 and installed it at rack bay D5.     [Doug had made necessary preparations in Node-2 yesterday.]
 
 Wheelock also completed the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh her CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on intravenous (IV) fluid infusion.    [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] 
 
 Fyodor conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Tracy, Sasha &amp; Misha again had an hour each set aside for personal crew departure preparations, standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
 With ISS command now being transferred from Alexander Skvortsov to Douglas Wheelock for Increment 25, beginning this week, and Fyodor Yurchikhin remaining aboard as the sole Russian cosmonauts, Alex &amp; Fyodor, at ~10:00am EDT, signed two copies of the formal Russian handover protocol document certifying RS (Russian Segment) handover/acceptance, including the contents of Progress 37P (#405), currently docked at DC1 nadir and Progress 39P (#407), docked at the SM aft port.     [The first copy remains on ISS, the second copy will be returned to the ground on Soyuz TMA-18.  “We, the Undersigned, have executed this Protocol to the effect that Skvortsov Alexander Alexandrovich, a crew member in charge of ISS RS E23/24, handed over and, Yurchikhin Fyodor Nikolayevich, a crew member in charge of ISS RS E24/25 accepted the ISS RS, including:- operation specifics, - onboard systems and hardware anomaly report,- Progress 405 and Progress 407 items (per IMS data).”]
 
 The traditional “Change of Command” ceremony is scheduled later today, at ~5:05pm-5:20pm EDT, with all crewmembers, officially marking the transfer of the baton from Increment 24 to Increment 25.     [The official “count” for I-25 begins on Monday, 9/27 (GMT 270).]
 
 At ~10:20am, Wheels powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 10:25rpm conducted a ham radio session with students and staff at Windsor Central School District, Windsor, NY.
 
 FE-4 &amp; FE-6 are scheduled for their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Doug at ~2:30pm, Shannon at ~4:25pm.
 
 Yurchikhin concluded his day by initiating recharge on the LK-2 video camera battery for the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment.    [GFI-1 will observe departure and re-entry of the Soyuz spacecraft.]
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-6), TVIS treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-3/2x, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after the last T2 session of the day but is now regularly being done once a week after the last T2 session.]
 
 22S Descent Timeline Overview:
 If everything proceeds nominally, the return to Earth of the TMA-17 spacecraft tomorrow, 9/23,
 will proceed along the following approximate event sequence (all times EDT):
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>ISS attitude control handover to RS --- 8:30pm; </li><li>ISS to free drift for undocking --- 9:31pm;</li><li>Undock command --- 9:32pm;</li><li>Separation springs action/physical sep (delta-V ~0.12 m/sec) --- 9:35pm; </li><li>Separation burn #1 (15 sec, ~0.63 m/sec) --- 9:38pm; </li><li>ISS maneuvers to Relaxation experiment attitude --- 11:48pm;</li><li>Deorbit Burn start (delta-V 115.2 m/sec) --- 12:04:23am; </li><li>Deorbit Burn complete --- 12:09:44pm; </li><li>Tri-Module separation (140 km alt) --- 12:29:15am; </li><li>ISS maneuvers to duty attitude --- 12:32am;</li><li>Atmospheric entry (99.5 km alt, with ~170 m/sec) --- 12:32:22am; </li><li>Entry Guidance start (80.5 km alt) --- 12:33:57 am;</li><li>Max G-load (34.5 km alt) --- 12:38:49am;</li><li>Parachute deploy command (10.8 km alt) --- 12:40:44am; </li><li>22S Landing (DO1) --- 12:55:44am EDT; 7:55:44am Moscow DMT; 10:55:44am local Kazakhstan; (loc. 47deg 22min N, 69deg 35min E);</li><li>ISS attitude control handover to US --- 1:10am.</li> </ul> [Note: Kazakhstan time = GMT+6h; = EDT+10h.  Moscow DMT = EDT+7h.]
 
 What the Soyuz TMA-18 crew will experience during their reentry/descent on Thursday evening: 
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>For the reentry, Skvortsov, Kornienko &amp; Caldwell-Dyson will wear the Russian Kentavr anti-G suit under their Sokol suits.    [The Kentavr garment is a protective anti-g suit ensemble to facilitate the return of a long-duration crewmember into the Earth gravity.  Consisting of shorts, gaiters, underpants, jersey and socks, it acts as countermeasure for circulatory disturbance, prevents crewmember from overloading during descent and increases orthostatic tolerance during post-flight adaptation.  Russian crewmembers are also advised to ingest fluid-electrolyte additives, viz., three sodium chloride tablets during breakfast and after the midday meal, each time with 300 ml of fluid, and two pills during the meal aboard Soyuz before deorbit.] </li><li>Before descent: 
  Special attention will be paid to the need for careful donning of the medical belt with sensors and securing tight contact between sensors and body. 
  During preparation for descent, before atmosphere reentry, crewmembers settle down comfortably in the Kazbek couches, fasten the belts, securing tight contact between body and the seat liner in the couch.</li><li>During de-orbit: 
  Dust particles starting to sink in the Descent Module (SA) cabin is the first indication of atmosphere reentry and beginning of G-load effect.  From that time on, special attention is required as the loads increase rapidly. 
  Under G-load effect during atmosphere reentry the crew expects the following experience: 
 Sensation of G-load pressure on the body, burden in the body, labored breathing and speech. These are normal sensations, and the advice is to "take them coolly".  In case of the feeling of a lump in the throat, this is no cause to "be nervous".  This is frequent and should not be fought.  Best is to "try not to swallow and talk at this moment".  Crew should check vision and, if any disturbances occur, create additional tension of abdominal pressure and leg muscles (strain +abdomen by pulling in), in addition to the Kentavr anti-G suit. 
 During deployment of pilot parachute (0.62 &amp; 4.5 square meters), drogue chute (16 sq.m.) and main (518 sq.m.) chutes the impact accelerations will be perceived as a "strong snatch".  No reason to become concerned about this but one should be prepared that during the parachutes deployment and change ("rehook") of prime parachute to symmetrical suspension, swinging and spinning motion of the SA occurs, which involves vestibular (middle ear) irritations.</li><li>It is important to tighten restrain system to fasten pelvis and pectoral arch. 
  Vestibular irritation can occur in the form of different referred sensations such as vertigo, hyperhidrosis, postural illusions, general discomfort and nausea.  To prevent vestibular irritation the crew should "limit head movement and eyes movement", as well as fix their sight on motionless objects.</li><li>Just before the landing (softened by six small rocket engines behind the heat shield): 
  Crew will be prepared for the vehicle impact with the ground, with their bodies fixed along the surface of the seat liner in advance.  "Special attention should be paid to arm fixation to avoid the elbow and hand squat" (instruction). Landing speed: ~9.9 m/sec.</li><li>After landing: 
  Crew should not get up quickly from their seats to leave the SA.  They were advised to stay in the couch for several minutes and only then stand up.  In doing that, they should limit head and eyes movement and avoid excessive motions, proceeding slowly.  Their body should not take up earth gravity in the upright position too quickly.</li></ul> 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Astana, Kazakhstan (ISS had a near nadir-viewing pass over the capital city of Kazakhstan.  The city is located on the Ishim River.  Overlapping frames of the urban area provide context for higher resolution imagery), Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (weather was predicted to be clear over this capital city.  The city is located in the Tuul River valley in the north central part of Mongolia.  Overlapping, nadir-viewing frames of the urban and surrounding rural area were requested), Bigach Impact Crater, Kazakhstan (ISS had a nadir-viewing pass over this 8 km in diameter impact structure. The roughly circular structure of the crater is somewhat subtle to recognize, and is located to the northwest of Lake Zhaysang.  Overlapping mapping frames, taken along track, were suggested in order to obtain imagery of the crater), Steinheim Impact Crater, Germany (ISS had a near nadir-viewing pass over this impact structure.  Looking slightly to the right of track; the impact structure is recognized primarily from detailed topographic measurements, and is visually discernable by drainage and agricultural patterns.  Overlapping mapping frames, taken along track, were recommended in order to obtain imagery of the crater), Ries Impact Crater, Germany (immediately after passing over the Steinheim impact structure, looking slightly to the left of track during a near nadir-viewing pass over the larger Ries Impact Crater.  At 24 km in diameter, this impact structure should be more visible on the landscape.  Overlapping mapping frames of the crater, taken along track, were recommended to obtain imagery of the crater), Twitchell Canyon Fire, Utah (the Twitchell Canyon Fire area, located to the northeast of Beaver, UT is now approximately 33,071 acres in area.  The fire was caused by a lightning strike, and is producing large smoke plumes.  Looking to the left of track for the fire area and associated smoke plumes), and Machine Gun Fire, Utah (the Machine Gun Fire, located approximately 2 miles south of Herriman, UT is currently over 4000 acres in area.  Looking to the right of track for the fire area and associated smoke plumes).
