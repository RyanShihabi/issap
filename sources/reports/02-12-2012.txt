ISS On-Orbit Status 02/12/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Crew off duty.   Ahead:  Week 12 of Increment 30 (six-person crew).
 
Nominal crew schedule was interrupted last night by a critical power loss on the ISS when Channel 3B BCDU (Battery Charge &amp; Discharge Unit) suffered a POR (Power-On Reset), cutting off power from essentially one solar array (see Update below).  Crew sleep ended at ~7:00pm EST (instead 1:00am), and the crew spent the night on supporting ground teams in restoring onboard systems.  ISS should be fully recovered by about 1:00pm EST. The recovery was extremely well executed.  Thanks everyone!
 
The emergency/restoration has kept the crew from enjoying their nominal off-duty Sunday schedule which includes –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel by FE-1 Shkaplerov as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Checkout and testing of the electrical food warmer (EPP/elektropodogrevatelya pishchi) by FE-2 Ivanishin,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">Routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB by Anatoly;   [this included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">A PFC (Private Family Conference) by CDR Burbank at ~2:00pm, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo1">The physical exercise workout routines by the crewmembers.</li></ul> 
New items added to Dan’s, Don’s &amp; André’s discretionary “job jar” task list:
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;text-autospace:none">A procedure for using the two-part Epoxy material to repair the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) PIP Switch Lever,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;text-autospace:none">Tightening and torque-striping both sets of ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) Upper Pushrod knurled nuts on the FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack)    [these knurled nuts have been known to vibrate loose on the ER-2 ( ExPRESS-2 Rack)],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Continuing the cleanup of the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) endcone area to enable creation of a trash staging area prior to Progress loading, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2;text-autospace:none">Installing a new JSL (Joint Station LAN) switch in Node 3,   [this hardware replaces an existing powered, but not utilized WAP in Node 3 and allows connection of more devices; even though the new switch will be installed, it will not be incorporated into the JSL for some time.] </li></ul> 
Tasks listed for Shkaplerov, Kononenko &amp; Ivanishin on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –

ISS Power Loss Update:   The power loss on Channel 3B (i.e., essentially all of solar array 3B) was caused by a POR (Power-On Reset) on a major DCSU (Direct Current Switching Unit).  This shifted loads upstream to BCDUs (Battery Charge &amp; Discharge Units) and tripped all of the BCDU fuse-type RBI (Remote Bus Isolator) switches.  As a result, power was lost to CMG-3 (Control Momentum Gyro 3), Ku-band communication prime antenna, and several MDM (Multiplexer/Demultiplexer) computers with their clients.  Ground teams immediately swung into action, monitoring thermal clocks to ensure no components violated their thermal limits, and keeping proper attitude control with the remaining 3 CMGs.  After analyzing the problem, flight controllers, with crew support, dove into several hours of repowering systems.  The crew was in no danger and the station was stable.  As of this morning all major power boxes were back online (one box took two power cycles to recover), and ISS is now almost fully recovered from the event.  There are a few minor cleanups needed to restore full station configuration.  CMG-3 is presently spinning up and should be back on line at about 1:00pm EST.   Background:  PORs occur occasionally and are considered random events (perhaps radiation induced).  The last one, on MBSU1 (Main Bus Switching Unit 1) was on 11/3/2008, the first time for an MBSU; systems restoration took 3 hrs.  The only other POR on a DCSU to date occurred on 2/11/2007, causing loss of Channel 2A (i.e., solar array 2A) with CMG-2 and other critical systems.
 
Conjunction Advisory:   Flight controllers are monitoring a conjunction with Object 34284 (COSMOS 2251) with a TCA (Time of Closest Approach) tomorrow (2/13) at 8:43pm EST.  Radial miss distance of this object is ~250m, remaining stable to date.  The first decision point (Go/NoGo for maneuver data Cyclogram development) is tonight at 9:13pm, for a DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) tomorrow at 6:25pm EST, if required. 
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
