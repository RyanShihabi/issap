SpaceX-5 Dragon Status:  On Saturday January 10th, SpaceX-5 successfully launched from Cape Canaveral at 3:47am CST. After a nominal rendezvous with ISS, the ISS Crew successfully captured the spacecraft today at 4:54am CST utilizing the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).  Robotics Ground Controllers then used the SSRMS to support the inspection of the Dragon Passive CBM and then to maneuver Dragon for installation onto the Node-2 Nadir Active CBM.  Once berthed, the crew completed pressurization, outfitting of the Node 2 to Dragon vestibule and removed the Node 2 Controller Panel Assemblies (CPAs).  Dragon ingress and start of cargo operations is scheduled to begin tomorrow.  The SSRMS will remain grappled to Dragon until the start of the SpaceX-5 Cloud Aerosol Transport System (CATS) payload operations on January 15th. 
Double cold Bag:  Wilmore reviewed double cold bag unpack procedures in preparation for SpaceX-5 arrival of cold stowage utilization.
General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator (GLACIER):  Wilmore performed desiccant pack swap on GLACIER #2 in preparation for SpaceX-5 cold stowage utilization.
T-Cell Activation in Aging prep:   Cristoforetti read the big picture words and watched a video introduction in preparation of the T-Cell Act In Aging experiment.  The crew also unstowed and set up Kubik units #3 and #6 in the Columbus module, relocated the portable power supplies, then activated and preheated the Kubik units to check temperature and functionality of the centrifuges.  T-Cell Activation in Aging seeks the cause of a depression in the human immune system while in microgravity. T-cells, a type of white cell, are coated with chemical receptors that must trigger together to activate the body’s immune system properly. T-cells from flight crews and ground volunteers in a range of ages are analyzed to determine changes in protein production and gene response on the ground and in microgravity.
