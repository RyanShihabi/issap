ISS On-Orbit Status 10/10/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday – return of Soyuz 18S and last day in space for Exp-20 members Padalka &amp; Barratt as well as SFP Laliberté.
 
 Crew wake/sleep cycle has been adjusted to accommodate Soyuz undocking tonight:  After wakeup this morning at 9:00am EDT, the crew is working through the day busy with last preparations for the undocking at ~9:05pm, then, beginning at ~1:05am, a long rest period until the nominal 2:00am at Monday morning (Columbus Day).
 
  FE-1 Barratt, FE-2 Stott, FE-4 Thirsk, FE-5 De Winne &amp; FE-5-21 Williams continued their week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Jeff’s first and Mike’s last, logging data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop as part of a week-long session.  Mike then doffed his Actiwatch (data to be downloaded at a later time).     [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
  For FE-5-21 Jeff Williams it was the second session of the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  Williams performed another two sessions with the RST (Reaction Self Test) on an A31p laptop (#1108 at Lab1O5) containing the appropriate software.    [The activity involves answering pre-test questions, testing reaction time, and providing performance feedback.]
 
  Later, Jeff completed the now regular transfer of pre-treated Russian urine directly from EDV-U container into the Lab UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) for processing, done each morning for about 5 minutes.
 
  Jeff also performed the regular weekly maintenance on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices), SLD cables and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.
 
  In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-4 Thirsk removed the AmiA (Antimicrobial Applicator) from the ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) and packed it in bubble wrap.  He then took a coolant sample from the ITCS for ground analysis.    [The AmiA was used to introduce OPA (Ortho-Phthalaldehyde), an antimicrobial agent, into the Kibo ITCS coolant.]
 
  In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Bob worked on the RaDI-N (Radiation Dosimetry inside ISS) assembly (which measures neutron flux), retrieving the eight SBDs (Space Bubble Detectors) and taking data readouts from them, with ground support standing by as required.   [FE-3 Romanenko assisted with the SBDs since they are also part of the Russian RBO-3-2 Matryoshka payload.]
 
  FE-2 Stott had time set aside for filling out her regular weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).    [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
  Both Barratt &amp; Padalka took their last physical workouts onboard, running the high-speed protocol on the new COLBERT treadmill T2, after ground engineers cleared the device for use after checking yesterday’s ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout) results by Nicole.
 
  FE-3 Roman Romanenko &amp; FE-1-21 Maxim Suraev transferred all remaining Russian VC science payloads from the ISS to the Soyuz TMA-14 SA (Descent Module), with Romanenko taking documentary photography.    [Transferred payloads included –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-10/KONYUGATSIYA</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-26/KASKAD</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-14/BIOEMULSIYA</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-27/ASTROVAKCINA</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BIO-1/POLIGENE</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-5/LAKTOLEN</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-6/ ARIL</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-7/OChB</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-40/BIF</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-41/BACTERIOPHAGE</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">TkhN-9/KRISTALLIZATOR      and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">BTKh-29/Zhenshen-2/Ginseng-2.]</li> </ul> 
  CDR Padalka also stowed the JAXA PCG (Protein Crystal Growth) payload in the 18S SA for return, after FE-2 Stott had removed it from the PCRF (Protein Crystallization Research Facility) in the Kibo JPM and turned it over to him.
 
  Padalka retrieved the hatch seal drive handle from the Soyuz 18S and handed it over to Romanenko for stowage in the FGB near the FGB GA transfer hatch.
 
  Nicole Stott closed the protective window shutters in the Lab and Kibo module in preparation for the Soyuz departure, and also deactivated the ham radio equipment in the SM &amp; FGB, to prevent RF interference with the Soyuz radio comm.
 
  With TMA-14 no longer available as contingency CRV (Crew Return Vehicle) for the coming Increment, Maxim Suraev transferred two VC Emergency Procedures ODF (DAS EP) books from 18S to Soyuz TMA-16/20S and one EMER-1 Book to the FGB.  As always, these were the last transfers.
 
  Afterwards (~2:40pm EDT), Gennady Padalka closed out the two listings of equipment items to be returned in the Soyuz SA and of excessed cargo stowed in the BO (Orbital Module), then reported loading completion status to TsUP-Moscow via S-band.
 
  After Frank De Winne unstowed the U.S. CDMK (Carbon Dioxide Monitor Kit), Padalka entered the 18S Descent Module at ~3:50pm and performs a final check of the cabin atmosphere with the CDMK (since the Soyuz CO<sub>2</sub> analyzer has failed).
 
  At ~4:25pm, Gennady performed the standard pre-undocking communications check, as Roman in the SM configured the STTS comm system for undocking.  
 
  As next step, Padalka will remove and inspect the SSVP BZV rigidizing quick-disconnect screw clamps, with documentary video recording.
 
  Activation of the spacecraft by Gennady &amp; Mike will take place at ~4:35pm-5:35pm.
 
  Subsequent hatch closure will be preceded by the traditional Crew Farewell at about 5:55pm between the departing Exp-20 crewmembers Padalka, Barratt &amp; Laliberté and the new Exp-21 station crew of De Winne, Suraev, Stott, Romanenko, Thirsk &amp; Williams.
 
  The departing Soyuz crew then starts the standard one-hour leak check on the Soyuz-to-DC1 vestibule.
 
  Shortly before the undocking (~9:05pm EDT), Romanenko will power up the “Istochnik-M” (“spring”, “source”) system for receiving telemetry from onboard the reentering Soyuz TMA-14 spacecraft, allowing ISS-based (and relayed-to-the-ground) monitoring of the tri-module separation event.    [The equipment, including Istochnik TM station, power amplifiers, power supply, USB software sticks and cables, was brought up on Progress 32P.] 
 
  After the departure, the station crew will complete a number of post-undocking tasks, such as –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Photographing the docking      interface of the receding Soyuz to ensure clean separation from the      docking port,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Reconfiguring the ISS STTS      onboard communications links,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Downlinking all      documentary photo/video of the undocking,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Monitoring the Soyuz      reentry with the Istochnik-M      system, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">Restoring nominal comm      config after the Soyuz landing.</li> </ul> 
  The new ISS CDR, Frank De Winne from Belgium, is scheduled for doing the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router and File Server SSC laptops.
 
  Maxim Suraev, the new FE-1, completed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.
 
  Max also undertook the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Additionally, the FE-1 did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-2, FE-1-21), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), T2/COLBERT (CDR, FE-1), and ARED advanced resistive exercise (FE-2, FE-4, FE-5, FE-5-21).
 
  Later, Stott transferred the exercise data files to the MEC for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  At ~1:00pm, Nicole had her weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
  
 CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) Update:   Kudos to Nicole from JAXA/SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center/Tsukuba):   “Thank you for working hard on the CBEF Manual Ventilation. The humidity inside CBEF decreased more than 1.7%RH and we should be able to see an effective bud pollination and seed formation.  With your great support, SPACE SEED samples for the short term cultivation will be harvested as planned on 10/13.”
