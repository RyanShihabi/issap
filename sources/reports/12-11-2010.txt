ISS On-Orbit Status 12/11/10
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday --- Crew rest day.
 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The ISS Program has been selected to receive the 2011 National Air and Space Museum Trophy for Current Achievement.  ISS Program Manager Mike Suffredini will receive the Trophy on behalf of the ISS Program at the annual NASM black tie dinner and awards ceremony in Washington on April 27, 2011.  Congratulations, team!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 


FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
Kelly, Skripochka &amp; Kaleri completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).      ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of the uborka house cleaning, Alex &amp; Oleg conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille and Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM (Service Module).     [Also, because bacteria growth exceeding a standard number was detected in the sample collected in the SM cabling (BKS) behind panel 429 during the microbiological analysis of the environment &amp; equipment of the RS (Russian Segment) in the final period of Exp-24, the two Flight Engineers were directed to also perform additional treatment of this surface ar4ea using Fungistat disinfectant.]
 
Oleg Skripochka completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
In the US Lab, CDR Kelly serviced the VCAM (Vehicle Cabin Atmosphere Monitor) by opening He (helium) valve #2, then shutting the access door again and re-attaching the acoustic blanket.      [The JPL-developed VCAM identifies gases that are present in minute quantities in the ISS breathing air that could be harmful to crew health.  If successful, instruments like VCAM could accompany crewmembers during long-duration exploration missions.  Similar to the earlier employed VOA (Volatile Organic Analyzer), VCAM can provide a means for monitoring the air within enclosed environments, using a miniature preconcentrator, GC (gas chromatograph), and mass spectrometer for unbiased detection of a large number of organic species.  VCAM's software can identify whether the chemicals are on a targeted list of hazardous compounds and their concentration.  A VCAM calibration gas is used periodically to check how the instrument’s components are actually performing.  The raw data, calibration data, and analysis results are all sent to the ground for further assessment to validate the instrument’s detection, identification, and quantification results.]
 
Jobs listed for Kaleri &amp; Skripochka today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for general views of glaciers and icebergs of Crozet Island, Kerguelen Island &amp; Herd Island, icebergs in the area of Bouvetøya island along the ice limit, Darwin Island (looking for concentric waves around the island), a natural lake preserve in Chile, general views to the north of the ISS flight path from bays to fjords,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~15-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining NIKON D3 photos with Nikkor 80-200 mm lens and the SONY HD video camcorder on oceanic color bloom patterns in the waters of South-Eastern Pacific., then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,</li></ul> 
Scott Kelly’s “discretionary “job jar” task list also received an addition today (hard-scheduled for Monday), for him to move CEVIS up by 2 seat track holes.    [Historically, the CEVIS cycle ergometer is generally located at the 6<sup>th</sup> seat track from the deck.  Last year, CEVIS was placed on CRAB (CEVIS Rack Attachment Bracket) to provide room for the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) when it was in the Lab.  When removed from CRAB, CEVIS was moved to the 9<sup>th</sup> seat track from the deck.  It was at this location when Wheels was hitting his head and thus he moved it down to its current location to provide more headroom.  Unfortunately, its current location is too low because the CEVIS frame hits the WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack.  So Scott has to move it back to the 6<sup>th</sup> seat track to prevent the frame from hitting WORF while providing sufficient headroom.]
 
The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR), and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).
 
Conjunction Update:    Flight controllers continue to monitor a conjunction with a piece of orbital debris, Object 25502 (an Atlas 2A Centaur rocket body) with TCA (Time of Closest Approach) on Saturday, 12/11, at 4:42pm EST, now classified as below the threshold for scheduling a DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver).   No maneuver was necessary.
