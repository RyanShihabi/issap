ISS On-Orbit Status 04/12/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   FD8 (Flight Day 8) of STS-131/19A. Crew sleep shifting in effect – see below.   Crew half-day off.    Underway: Week 4 of Increment 23.
 
 Today Russia observes Denj Kosmonavtov (Cosmonauts Day) and the world Yuri’s Night -- celebrating Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin's pioneering flight into space 49 years ago.  And NASA is observing the 29<sup>th</sup> anniversary of STS-1, the first Space Shuttle mission to orbit. 
 [Yuri was accepted into the cosmonaut unit in 1960, at age 26.  After his historic 108-min. flight around the Earth in “Vostok 1” on April 12, 1961, which ended with a parachute ejection at 7 km altitude over a farm field near the city of Engels in Saratov Oblast (province), he was promoted to unit leader.  Seven years later, on March 27, 1968, Yuri died with a flight instructor in a fighter jet crash.  Chief Designer of the thusly inaugurated Soviet human space program was Sergey Pavlovich Korolev.  Exactly 20 years after Yuri’s flight, John Young &amp; Bob Crippen took the Columbia into space for a daring test mission lasting 2 days 6 hours 20 minutes 52 seconds.]
 
 After wake-up (9:51pm last night), CDR Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg again inspected the filters before bedtime this noon, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 At wake-up, FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson began a new week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s fourth, Tracy’s first, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 As a handover task, Kotov, Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko joined in performing the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) removal system’s spare AVK emergency vacuum valves, in the spare parts kit.    [The AVKs are crucial because they close the Vozdukh's vacuum access lines in the event of a malfunction in the regular vacuum valves (BVK) or a depressurization in the Vozdukh valve panel (BOA).  Access to vacuum is required to vent CO<sub>2</sub> during the regeneration of the absorbent cartridges (PP).]
 
 The CDR performed the functional check of the running Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM (Service Module) for taking structural dynamics data during the docked period.  Afterwards, Kotov copied the data to a USB drive, cleared the archive and downlinked the files.  The hardware was then restarted to continue taking data.     [Data calldown to TsUP/Moscow must be done once a day during joint flight of 19A with the ISS, the file downlink and restart every third day.  IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
 Afterwards, Kotov did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Oleg also completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 For an upcoming new run of the BAR KELVIN experiment, set up in the FGB, Kotov later started charging the battery for the KPT-2 TTM-2 payload.     [Objective of the Russian BAR-EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  The payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss anemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
 Caldwell-Dyson started another sampling run (the 85<sup>th</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer).  Tracy deactivated the system ~5 hrs later.     [Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 Afterwards, Tracy supported ground-commanded water processing by setting up the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) for collecting condensate.  After completion of WPA processing, with WPA supply water available, FE-2 turned off the WDS (Water Delivery System).
 
 Performing the periodic maintenance &amp; visual inspection of the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), Tracy also checked out the rails &amp; rollers, greased the Y- and Z-axis rails &amp; rollers and evacuated its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.
 
 After reviewing procedures material on sample transferring, FE-5 Noguchi transferred science specimen from MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) to the Shuttle GLACIER (General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator) for return to Earth.
 
 Also in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Soichi removed the BSTC (Biotechnology Specimen Temperature Controller) from ER-4 (EXPRESS Rack 4) and installed two vent closeout panels in its place.  BSTC was then transferred to the MPLM.
 
 Before start of today’s cargo transfers from MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) Leonardo, Caldwell-Dyson transferred the VCA-1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) camcorder from the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to the Node-2, mounting it on the zenith “ceiling” for monitoring cargo transfer activities in the MPLM/Node-2 area.   [Tracy returned it to the COL at the end of the crew day and installed on its seat track at the Port Endcone, aft side.]
 
 Cargo transfers were performed by Tracy, Soichi, Dex Poindexter, Naoko Yamazaki &amp; Dottie “ML” Metcalf-Lindenburger.
 
 TJ Creamer &amp; Steph Wilson had ~3 hrs set aside to reconfigure the MARES (Muscle Atrophy Resistive Exercise System) hardware for stowage to reduce the amount of excess hardware and packing foam left on ISS, organizing the dozens of MARES components in orderly fashion in three stowage bags, aided by uplinked schematics. 
 
 Misha Kornienko completed the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways. [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 Skvortsov, Kornienko &amp; Caldwell-Dyson again had about an hour’s time to themselves for general adaptation (station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
 At ~11:31pm EDT last night, Skvortsov, Kotov &amp; Kornienko downlinked a PAO “TV Bridge” message of greetings to participants of an event of Russia's Youth Alliance in Orenburg in observance of today’s Cosmonautics Day.
 
 At ~2:26am, Noguchi conducted his regular tagup with the Japanese Flight Control Team at SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center)/Tsukuba via S-band/audio.   [This conference is scheduled once every week, between the ISS crewmembers and SSIPC.]
 
 At ~3:46am, the ISS Exp-23 crew received a 15-min VIP call from Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, joined by the Head of Roskosmos, Anatoly Perminov, Cosmonauts Maxim Suraev &amp; Sergei Volkov, plus other distinguished dignitaries and guests.  The exchange went excellent, with very good comm linkup.
 
 At ~5:06am, Cosmonautics Day congratulations were also the subject of a TV conference call from top management of RSC-Energia, IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems) and GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) to Alex, Oleg &amp; Misha, via S- &amp; Ku-band.
 
 At ~6:41am, FE-5 Soichi Noguchi &amp; MS4 Naoko Yamazaki received a PAO TV VIP call from Japan’s Minister of Space Policy Seiji Maehara, Chief Cabinet secretary Hirofumi Hirano in Tokyo, and students from Matsudo City Sagamidal Elementary School, Matsudo City Daiichi Junior High School and the Young Astronauts Club, moderated by former JAXA Astronaut Mamoru Mohri, today Director of the National Museum of Emerging Science &amp; Innovation.
 
 FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, TJ at ~10:31am, Soichi at ~12:26pm.
 
 At ~8:46am, Alex had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
 At ~9:46am this morning, the Shuttle crew held an in-depth one-hour review of procedures for the EVA-3 spacewalk, with egress scheduled early tomorrow morning at ~3:11am.
 
 At ~12:46pm, Rick Mastracchio (EV1) &amp; Clay Anderson (EV2) began their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) in the A/L with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe (~12:46pm-1:51pm) and sleep from 2:21pm-10:21pm tonight.  A hygiene break, with temporary repress to 14.7psi and depress back to 10.2psi, is scheduled for 10:56pm-12:06pm.   [Sleep for the ISS crew began at 1:51pm.]
 
 The crew completed today’s physical workout regime on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-5, FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).
 
 WRM Update:  A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.     [The updated card (23-0003C) lists 97 CWCs (2,341.5 L total) for the five types of water now identified on board: 1. technical water (20 CWCs with 759.1 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 432.1 L in 12 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 149.4 L in 4 bags still requiring sample analysis,  2. potable water (9 CWCs with 366.7 L, of which 1 bag with 23.0 L contains Wautersia, 1 bag with 43.6 L requires sample analysis, 4 bags with 170.8 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use,  3. iodinated water (58 CWCs with 1068.7 L),  4. condensate water (8 bags with 122.7 L, including 2 empty ones and 2 CWCs with 43.4 L that are to be used with microbial filter, and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (2 CWCs with 24.3 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 TVIS Update:    TVIS treadmill is currently No-Go due to noise reported in the left rear quadrant.    [Crew inspection has since uncovered dust, rubber &amp; metal shavings (potential metallic debris sources are loose slat(s) contacting a deck plate or side panel; the rubber debris may be from the belt or side rollers).  The crew performed an audio capture of system power-up, unmanned and manned sessions.  Ground team did not hear the noise reported by the crew, but did hear a noise related to the stabilizer.  The TVIS annual maintenance, which is scheduled during the week of 4/19, has been modified to inspect belt slat fastener, side rollers and deck plates for damage.  No impact to Shuttle crew (CDR &amp; PLT) exercise.]
