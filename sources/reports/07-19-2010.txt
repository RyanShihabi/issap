ISS On-Orbit Status 07/19/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Underway: Week 7 of Increment 24.
 
 Upon wake-up, CDR Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [The CDR will inspect the filters again before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Also at wake-up, FE-4 Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker conducted another run of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 The crew started out with the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement, using the IM mass measurement device.  Kornienko set up the IM and later stowed it away.  The three Russian crewmembers, Alex, Mikhail &amp; Fyodor, also completed the PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement protocol.     [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IM "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures. ]
 
 Caldwell-Dyson &amp; Kornienko completed the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh their CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on airways issues for both.  [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] 
 
 FE-2 started another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer), deactivating the system ~5 hrs later.     [This was the 11<sup>th</sup> session with the new GC/DMS unit (#1004), after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 100 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 FE-3 moved Russian cargo (GRUZ) from the FGB to the MRM1 Rassvet module.
 
 Preparatory to removal/installation tasks on the JAXA ground-controlled FACET experiment scheduled tomorrow, FE-4 switched cable connections on the SCOF (Solution Crystallization Observation Facility), disconnecting the FPEF (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility) payload bus and IPU (Image Processing Unit) User Video cables and mating the SCOF payload bus cable and IPU User Video Cables connection.    [The series of the SCOF/FACET tasks is not only sample cell exchange but also includes trouble shooting steps, i.e., installation of SCOF Air Circulation Covers.  FACET is an investigation of the mechanism of faceted cellular array growth.  In order to investigate the phenomena at the solid-liquid interface in facet growth, in-situ observation of concentration and temperature diffusion field with two wavelength interferometer are carried out using transparent organic materials under microgravity condition.  Results can provide the useful data on the optimization of the crystal growth condition not only in space but also on earth.]
 
 In preparation for the upcoming US spacewalk (EVA-15), Doug also underwent a familiarization session with the ECWS (EMU Caution &amp; Warning Simulator) onboard trainer.
 
 Yurchikhin &amp; Kornienko continued their preparations for the Russian EVA-25 spacewalk, working in the DC1 Docking Compartment and SM PkhO (Service Module Transfer Compartment) supported by an uplinked 246-items list, to configure the POV EVA support panels of the compartments for the spacewalk.
 
 Afterwards, Fyodor completed the periodic (monthly) functional closure test of the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) BVK standalone vacuum valve group #68 from the Vozdukh PK SOA control panel, supported by ground specialist tagup.
 
 Yurchikhin also performed periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), recording data from the radiation detectors in the Bubble-dosimeter reader and rearranging some dosimeters.     [Bubble dosimeter detectors are positioned at their exposure locations around the RS.  Measurements were taken today from some of them.  Their measurements (exposure duration, bubble quantity, dose) were recorded in the Reader on PCMCIA memory card and reported to TsUP via log sheet over OCA.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]
 
 Working in the US A/L (Airlock) on an EMU (Extravehicular Activity Unit) battery (#2088), Caldwell-Dyson repaired damaged tape on the battery using aluminum tape (“duct tape”).     [Purpose of the damaged tape is to reduce EMI (electromagnetic interference) effects and for heat rejection.]
 
 Afterwards, FE-2 set up EVA batteries in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly) for the first round of recharging (of two).    [Charging was initiated on 2 EMU batteries (#2086, #2088), 6 HL (Helmet Light) batteries, 4 PGT (Pistol Grip Tool) batteries and 1 REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly).]
 
 TC also conducted the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer) in Node-3, after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.    [After the approximately 2 hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.]
 
 In the Soyuz TMA-19/23S, FE-5 Yurchikhin installed the BlP Console Logic Unit for the BVN Air Heater Fan at its nominal location and connected the required grounding straps.
 
 Later, the CDR supported the ground-commanded reactivation of the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator by monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.    [The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]
 
 FE-6 Walker supported POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center/Huntsville) in the COL on the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) with the startup for the next (third) run of the SAME (Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment).
 
 Afterwards, Shannon set up the equipment (camera &amp; beacons) for a test session with the SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites) experiment in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module, 2<sup>nd</sup> time after Tracy’s work there on 6/11), dimmed GLAs (General Luminaire Assemblies), programmed and deployed satellite(s), using an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop to command execution of tests.      [The SPHERES experiment is a test bed for the development and testing of formation flying and other multi-spacecraft control algorithms.  Sessions use several satellites and beacons on mounts, with CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon Dioxide) tanks and battery packs, to experiment with docking, formation flight, and reconfigurations.  In addition, the sessions add a wide range of control algorithms for maneuvers previously demonstrated using basic control laws.  Modern robust control techniques are combined with path planning and formation flight algorithms to improve the performance of the system.  The session also continues to obtain data for control reconfiguration after satellites dock (and their mass properties change).  Per applicable Flight Rule, SPHERES operations have no CO<sub>2</sub> output constraints if the CDRA (CO<sub>2</sub> Removal Assembly) is operating in dual-bed or single-bed mode.]
 
 Walker also downloaded the ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) data from her recent (7/16-17) Ambulatory Monitoring session, using a relatively new ICV procedure to download data from all devices directly to the HRF (Human Research Facility) PC1.    [The procedure had her download her Actiwatch data (from 2 Actiwatches), copy data from the HM2 (Holter Monitor 2) HiFi CF Cards (two), and download Cardiopres data to the HRF PC.]
 
 Wheelock &amp; Caldwell-Dyson had ~2 hrs for resizing their spacesuits in the A/L for EVA-15 on 8/5.    [EMU 3009 was resized by Tracy for herself, EMU 3005 by Wheels for his use.  Some parts of 3005 &amp; 30098 were taken from EMU 3010.] 
 
 FE-2 prepared the OGS (Oxygen Generation System) for tomorrow’s scheduled Recirculation Loop flush by opening the right access door of the rack to allow for 24 hrs of thermal equalization.
 
 After terminating overnight charging of the KPT-2 Piren battery, Mikhail Kornienko &amp; Alexander Skvortsov ran another 2.5hr-session with the Russian KPT-2 BAR payload, taking background environmental parameters in the SM (Service Module) in areas found in the past to have high microflora growth indications (behind panels 134, 334, 335, 336).  The crewmembers used the new Piren-B Pyro-endoscope instrument and Iva-6A Thermal Hygrometer (to identify potential condensation areas), with the RSE1 laptop.  The measurements are required to forecast the rate of local shell micro-destruction and to develop measures to extend station life.  Afterwards, the crew cleaned up and closed out.       [Piren-B, a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, is part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Besides Piren-B, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
 Alex completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Doug set up the demo equipment for another session of the experiment series called “Kids in Micro-G”.  Assisted by Tracy with video &amp; photo documentation, Wheels then conducted the student experiment, today showing the “Speed” flight procedures” in micro-gravity.      [The “Kids in Micro-G” suite of experiments was developed and written by 6<sup>th</sup> grade students to demonstrate Newton’s Laws of Motion both on ISS and in the classroom.]
 
 TC stowed the KUBIK-3 cooler/incubator after completion of its drying.
 
 The CDR had ~50 min. for shooting additional newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7 #2 high-definition camcorder as part of the ongoing effort to create a photo &amp; video imagery database on the flight of ISS-23/24 (“Flight Chronicles”), today focusing on payload scenes.     [Footage subjects generally include life on the station, personal hygiene, food intake, playing with water, enjoying weightlessness, exercise, moving about, station interior, Earth surface, space clothing, cosmonaut at work, station cleaning, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.]
 
 Yurchikhin did the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Skvortsov set up for another ~50-min session of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program at SM window 9 with the NIKON D2X digital camera with 800mm telelens, targeting specific photo/video target sites.
 
 Later, Alex also conducted a ~30-min photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining NIKON D3 photos and SONY HD video data on oceanic water blooms in the waters of North-Western Africa, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop.
 
 Working in the MRM1 “Rassvet” module, Fyodor performed the periodic maintenance on the module’s ventilation system by cleaning Group B dust filters, SKPF1 &amp; SKPF2 filters and the GZhT heat exchanger grille.
 
 FE-4 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Shannon at ~10:15am, Doug at ~1:50pm.
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-2, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-2, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-4) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-3, FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the 
 
 Before turning in for the night, Tracy Caldwell-Dyson is the scheduled subject for the PanOptic eye test which requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination performed by Doug Wheelock as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) with an ophthalmoscope.     [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still &amp; video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula &amp; optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.]
 
 No CEO photo targets uplinked for today.
