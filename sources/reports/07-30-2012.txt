ISS On-Orbit Status 07/30/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway:  Week 5 of Increment 32 (six-person crew).
 
Due to yesterday’s action-packed RS (Russian Segment) day of Progress 47P redocking, removal of the Kurs-NA system and preparing the cargo ship for tonight’s final undocking, the three Russian crewmembers continued their sleep cycle shifts into today:
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Sleep3 – 9:00pm (yesterday) – CDR</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Sleep3 – 5:30pm (yesterday) – FE-2</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Sleep3 – 6:50pm (yesterday) – FE-4</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Wake4 – 5:30am (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Sleep4 – 5:30pm (today)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Wake5 – 2:00am (tomorrow) – returning to nominal.</li></ul> 
At wakeup (5:30am), Gennady Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  FE-2 also conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
Upon wakeup (2:00am), FE-3 Acaba, FE-5 Williams &amp; FE-6 Hoshide completed their weekly post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, the 25<sup>th</sup> for Joe, the 4<sup>th</sup> for Suni &amp; Aki.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
FE-5 Williams began her first (FD15) suite of sessions with the controlled Pro K diet protocol (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording her diet input today, Sunita will begin the urine collections for pH value on Wednesday (8/2) and blood sampling on Thursday (8/3).       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.]
 
FE-4 Malenchenko completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~5:15pm EDT.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 7/12 &amp; 7/13.]
 
Sergei Revin configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h 15m session, his 3<sup>rd</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
Other activities assigned to FE-2 Revin for completion during the day included – 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">The periodic (every Monday) verification of the automatic IUS AntiVirus definition update on the Russian VKS auxiliary network laptops RSS1, RSS2, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2, as well as the manual update on the non-network laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1;     [Antivirus update procedures have changed since the SSCV4 software update.  Before the installation (on 8/8/11) of the new automated procedure, the refresh was done manually on Mondays on RSS2, copying the files to the RSS2 service folder, then launching update scripts on the network laptops RSS1, RSK1-T61p &amp; RSK2 and finally manually updating non-network laptops RSE-Med &amp; RSE1.  On Tuesdays, the anti-virus scanning results are regularly verified on all laptops.  Nominally, Russian network laptops have software installed for automatic anti-virus update; fresh data is copied on RSK1-T61p &amp; RRSK2 every time a computer is rebooted with a special login, and on RSS1 once daily.  On Russian non-network laptops antivirus definition file update is done by the crew once every two weeks on Monday],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Continuing the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems by cleaning the V3 fan grill in MRM2 Poisk,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">The routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM;   [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Standard service on the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 by downloading the new batch of structural dynamics measurements of the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA;    [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Another 30-min. session for the DZZ-13 (Distantsionnoye zondirovaniye zemli/Remote Sensing of Earth-13) “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining SONY HDV-Z7E camcorder footage and NIKON D3-U01 (f=80mm) imagery of color bloom patterns in the waters of the South-Eastern Pacific and coastal South America, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop.</li></ul> 
Joe Acaba &amp; Suni Williams spent more time in HTV3 cargo transfers, after having made considerable progress last Saturday.  FE-3 tags up with ground specialists at ~1:40pm to report on further unloading status.
 
Suni serviced the new YTSL (YouTube SpaceLab) payload with its two live occupants, installing six GAPs after deactivating CGBA-5 and restraining with the CGBA restraint system, then closing and reactivating CGBA-5.        [POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) reported that one spider is eating, and ground staff is waiting on confirmation on the second spider.]
 
In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), with the G1 video camera set up to capture his activities, FE-6 Hoshide prepared the Nano Step payload by installing the cartridge and circuit box into the SCOF (Solution Crystallization Observation Facility).     [JAXA’s objective is to study the relationship between the growth mechanism and the perfection of protein crystals.  It is expected that the growth rate at various supersaturations can be studied in more detail in micro-G, and the outcome will provide guidelines for making high quality crystals, which will help to understand amino acid structure in protein.  Three kinds of samples will be used for the experiment.  Each sample experiment will last 35 days, while observing state &amp; speed of the crystal grown in space.  Observation with an interferometer is performed during crew sleep every day except weekends since the fringe image is susceptible to jitter.]
 
Later, Akihiko began the ESA/German experiment CRHYT (Circadian Rhythms), performing instrumentation of the Thermolab Double Sensors, mounting the Thermolab Unit in the belt, connecting &amp; powering on the Thermolab Unit for the next 36 hours during which the equipment is worn.       [The main objective of the experiment is to get a better basic understanding of any alterations in circadian rhythms in humans during long-term space flights.  Such knowledge will not only provide important insights into the adaptations of the human autonomic nervous system in space over time, but also has significant practical implications by helping to improve physical exercise, rest- and work shifts as well as fostering adequate workplace illumination in the sense of occupational healthcare in future space missions.  The Circadian Rhythms experiment is performed over 3 days (from Day 1 to Day 3) and involves:  Instrumentation (Day 1); 36-hrs continuous measurement (Day 1 + 2 + 3), and De-instrumentation (Day 3).  On-orbit measurements are planned for FD 15, FD30 and then at 30 day intervals until return.  During day 1, the instrumentation is performed late in the afternoon. This consists of donning the Thermolab Double Sensors at the forehead and sternum positions. By powering on the Thermolab Control Unit the 36 hours measurement is started.  During day 2, the Thermolab Control Unit will measure throughout the day. No interaction is required other than confirming the Thermolab Control Unit is measuring by checking the display from time to time.
Early on day 3, the de-instrumentation is performed. This consists of doffing the sensors and stowing the equipment.  Data transfer from the Thermolab Control Unit will be performed during the VO2 Max experiment.]
 
In preparation for tonight’s undocking of Progress 47P (5:16pm EDT), Suni will power down the amateur/ham radio equipment in COL and SM to prevent RF interference with the cargo ship, while Joe closes the protective shutters of the Lab, Node-3/Cupola &amp; Kibo lab windows against thruster effluent contamination.
 
After the undocking, Yuri will manually close the KVD/PEV (Pressure Equalization Valve) between the DC1 “Pirs” Docking Module and its docking port vestibule.
 
CDR Padalka will be monitoring the undocking &amp; departure of 47P before his sleeptime and take documentary photography &amp; video of the docking interface of the departing cargo ship to check on the integrity of the DC1 nadir docking hardware (e.g., no rubber rings protruding or otherwise interfering).
 
Aki Hoshide had another hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
Suni Williams had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in her electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
At ~1:10pm EDT, Joe is scheduled for his regular weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-3, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR, FE-4).
 
After his workout on the T2 machine, Aki closed down the treadmill software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display.     [After the display shutdown, the T2 rack is power cycled (turned off/on) from the ground, and T2 is then ready for use.  These power cycles allow for the T2 data to be transferred to the Server for downlink.] 
 
Before Presleep, FE-3 turns on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
Progress M-15M/47P Undocking:    For tonight’s final undocking of the 47P cargo ship, ISS attitude control authority will be handed over to Russian MCS (Motion Control System) thrusters at 4:40pm, followed by maneuvering on thrusters to Undock Attitude and a brief period of Free Drift (5:15pm-5:20pm).  Attitude control will be returned to to US Momentum Management with CMGs (Control Moment Gyroscopes) at 6:05pm.
