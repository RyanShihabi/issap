Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4): The crew verified that the Video Monitor was switched on and that the Columbus Video Camera (VCA2) was on the monitor laptop screen for ground team monitoring. PK-4 looks at complex or “dusty” plasmas, in which small particles are suspended and form patterns in ionized gas. More information on PK-4 can be found here.
Sleep in Orbit: The crew concluded Monday night’s science session and prepared for the Tuesday night session. More information on the Sleep in Orbit experiment can be found here.
