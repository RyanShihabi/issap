ISS On-Orbit Status 06/22/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
Before breakfast, FE-5 Furukawa conducted Part 2 of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, today taking the three crew-worn dosimeters from the 27S crew and deploying them for static measurements in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module, #1011), Node-3 at Midbay Overhead (#1012) and MRM1 (Mini-Research Module 1) Rassvet (#1013).
 
CDR Borisenko conducted the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  Andrey will terminate the process at ~5:15pm EDT before sleep time.  Bed #2 regeneration was performed yesterday.      [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days. (Last time done: 6/2-6/3).]
 
Afterwards, Andrey performed maintenance on the new Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, replacing the software in the CR10X module with an upgrade, as required for correct operation of the measurement system and for maintaining proper moisture.   Using the RSK2 T61p laptop, the CDR then tested the hardware setup, supported by ground specialist tagup via S-band.     [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] 
 
After yesterday’s intermodular test session with the TORU automated teleoperator system by FE-4 Volkov &amp; FE-1 Samokutyayev with the mated Soyuz 27S, which had to be repeated due to some difficulties to ensure hardware functionality, Sergei &amp; Aleksandr this morning tagged up with ground specialists at ~4:15am EDT to discuss the TORU activity.     [TORU functionality is required for docking.]
 
Afterwards, Sasha spent most of his work day in the SM (Service Module) with uninstalling &amp; removing the ATV PCE (Automated Transfer Vehicle / Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) hardware which was used for the undocking and prox ops of ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” on 6/20.      [Specifically, Sasha disconnected the associated BKS cabling and uninstalled the PCE Z0000 prox comm box and BUAP antenna switching control box, then disconnected the cabling to the MBRL mono-block with its PU control panel and removed the hardware for subsequent stowage.]
 
FE-6 Fossum worked in the US A/L (Airlock), preparing the EL (Equipment Lock) segment for today’s EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) Dry Run exercise and configuring the necessary EVA tools.  Afterwards, Mike was joined by FE-3 Garan &amp; FE-5 Furukawa in reviewing uplinked briefing material for the Dry Run.     [For the EL preparation, Mike gathered the necessary EMU ancillary equipment, filled up drink bags, configured the PHA (Prebreathe Hose Assemblies) masks &amp; hoses, and prepared the EMUs.  The PHA masks will be replaced on STS-135.  Using filled drink bags for the Dry Run was optional for fit verification, and the DIDBs (Disposable In-suit Drink Bags) were discarded after the session.]
 
Later, Ron, Mike &amp; Satoshi spent ~3h 25m on the Dry Run in preparation for Ron’s &amp; Mike’s planned spacewalk during ULF7, followed by a post-dryrun conference tagup with the ground.      [Purpose of the Dry Run was spacesuit fit verification, plus some procedures review.  The session included LCVG (Liquid Cooling &amp; Ventilation Garments) water fill procedure (for which the suits had to be powered up), ISLE (In-Suit Light Exercise) EVA prep, EMU Purge (simulated), ISLE EMU Prebreathe with Data Collection (read-through of steps only), Crewlock Depress (most of it simulated), Post Depress (simulated), Pre Repress (simulated), Crewlock Repress (mostly simulated), and Post EVA (doffing the EMUs &amp; drying them out overnight.  Metox Regen was not required.]
 
Sergei Volkov conducted the periodic audit/inventory of SSVP (Docking &amp; Internal Transfer System) accessories, including consolidating their kits (located at various locations in Soyuz 27S, FGB, SM, DC1, MRM2, and MRM1), followed by ground specialist tagup via S-band.
 
Afterwards, FE-4 unstowed the Russian Reflotron-4 hardware and applied a bar code to the Accu-Chek Softclix Pro perforator, which he then stowed in the Reflotron accessories kit.    [Earlier Reflotron versions have operated already on space station Mir for blood analysis.  Clinical data are determined from a blood sample.  Using various reagent tabs, the blood is tested with strips (KPI) for such parameters as hemoglobin, glucose, bilirubin, amylase, uric acid, triglycerides, urea, creatinin, cholesterol, etc.  Reflotron-4 uses 40 W of power, supplied by the SM’s electrical system.]
 
Sergei also terminated his first session of the standard 24-hour ECG (Electrocardiogram) recording under the Russian MedOps PZE MO-2 protocol.       [After 24 hrs of ECG recording and blood pressure measurements with the Kardiomed system, Sergei doffed the five-electrode Holter harness that read his dynamic (in motion) heart function from two leads and recorded on the “Kardioregistrator 90205” unit.  The examination results were then downloaded from the Holter ECG device to the RSE-Med laptop, controlled by the Kardiomed application.  Later, the data were also to be downlinked as a compressed .zip-file via OCA.]
 
After configuring STTS communication systems temporarily for crew presence in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, Borisenko conducted another active session with the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), supported by ground specialist tagup.  STTS was then reconfigured to nominal.  Andrey later set up the two SONY HVR-Z1J video camcorders for replaying and downlinking their recorded footage during two RGS (Russian Groundsite) passes (8:40am-9:05am &amp; 10:15am-10:39am EDT).        [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS: condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
After reviewing uplinked procedures for his subsequent maintenance activities in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and setting up the VCA1  (Video Camera Assembly 1) camcorder for coverage, Ron Garan inspected &amp; cleaned the RGSH (Return Grid Sensor Housing) in the COL Port Cone/Deckside location with the vacuum cleaner, installed AORG add-on screens and checked out the air loop.
 
Later, Ron installed a software update for the T2/COLBERT treadmill and performed an unmanned ACO (Activation &amp; Checkout) test.
 
Next, FE-3 printed out &amp; deployed a new T2 cue card to reflect the software update.      [The treadmill software accommodates either Pacebook (touch screen) or Laptop (keyboard) manipulation.]
 
With the STTS communications system still configured for working in the MRM2 module, Sergei Volkov conducted a tagup with ground specialists and then began installation and preparation for operating the new KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall-3 plus) Telescience payload, the first time for Expedition 28.  Afterwards, the FE-4 conducted a leak check on the EB vacuum chamber and later returned the STTS comm system to nominal.     [The PK-3+ hardware comprises the EB (Eksperimental’nyj Blok) Experiment Module with a turbopump for evacuation, Ts laptop, video monitor, vacuum hoses, electrical circuitry, four hard storage disks for video, and one USB stick with the control application.  After setting up the hardware in MRM2 (it used to be run in the SM/Service Module), Sergei today configured vacuum and electrical connections, installed external hard drives and conducted a leak check on the electronics box.  The experiment is performed on plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber.  Main objective is to obtain a homogeneous plasma dust cloud at various pressures and particle quantities with or without superimposition of an LF (low frequency) harmonic electrical field.  The experiment is conducted in automated mode.  PK-3+ has more advanced hardware and software than the previously used Russian PKE-Nefedov payload.]
 
Volkov also conducted another photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining photo &amp; video data on oceanic color bloom patterns in the Central-Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop.
 
Furukawa had ~1.5h reserved for gathering &amp; prepacking cargo for ULF7.
 
Later, Satoshi conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks).
 
Mike Fossum broke out and configured the equipment for his first 24-hr urine collections under the NUTRITION/Repository protocol, starting tomorrow morning.
 
CDR Borisenko took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Andrey also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Afterwards, Andrey completed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways to ensure the ventilation/circulation system performs adequately with the six-member station crew.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
Later, the CDR completed another data collection session for the psychological program MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”), accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was his 5<sup>th</sup> onboard session with MBI-16.      [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Soyuz 27S crewmembers Volkov, Fossum &amp; Furukawa again had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
At ~2:10pm, Sasha, Sergei &amp; Andrey supported a Russian PAO TV downlink, transmitting messages of greetings – (1) to the participants of the All-Russian Youth Forum "Seliger-2011" at Lake Seliger in Tver region on 7/1-7/9; (2) to B.I. Vorovich on his 80th anniversary.      [The Seliger 2011 Youth Forum on the shore of Lake Seliger will be attended by more than 1100 talented young specialists, scientists and students from different regions of the Russian Federation (RF).  The Seliger 2011 forum will have a number of topical increments, including “Innovations and technological ingenuity”.  RKK Energia’s young scientists and engineers participating in the forum will promote Russia’s past and present achievements in space exploration, tell about RKK Energia’s contribution to engineering space rockets and its role in making the first manned space flight possible, and will have an opportunity to demonstrate their R&amp;D projects and technologies and to receive government support for their implementation.— B.I. Vorovich is the veteran director of the Mar’ino Recreation Center under the auspices of the Administrative Department of the President of the RF.] 
 
FE-3, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Ron at ~9:25am, Mike at ~1:50pm, Satoshi at ~2:05pm EDT.
 
Before “Presleep” period tonight, Garan powers on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
Ron also set up the Node-3 video camcorder for recording the exercise sessions of Andrey, Sasha and himself on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser, to meet the video requirements for recording these exercises every 30 days.  FE-3 later stowed the video gear again.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).
 
After the last T2 treadmill exercise session, Mike Fossum performed the periodic T2 snubber arm stacks inspection of witness marks (to indicate undesired motion), done once a month to track structural integrity of the hardware with a “wiggle” test.
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Victoria, Seychelles (Victoria is the capital city of the Republic of Seychelles and can be located on the northeastern side of Mahe Island, the largest island of the archipelago.  ISS had a nadir pass, and overlapping mapping frames of the urban area were requested), Lake Nasser, Toshka Lakes, Egypt (the Toshka Lakes formed in the late 1990's when record high water in the Nile River and Lake Nasser spilled out into desert depressions to the west.  Since then the lakes have persisted, but continue to slowly dry up.  The crew was to update the CEO monitoring record of this event with context views of the lakes.  Looking right of track and taking overlapping images), and Ubinas Volcano, Peru (ISS had a pass near Peru's most active volcano Ubinas, looking left of track.  Some clouds may have been present.  Overlapping frames of the volcano summit and flanks were requested.  It was recommended to commence photography as ISS crossed the Peruvian coastline and to terminate the Ubinas session as it approached Lake Titicaca as the best means of capturing the volcano).
