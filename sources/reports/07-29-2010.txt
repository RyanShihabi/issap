ISS On-Orbit Status 07/29/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
 Upon wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 will inspect the filters again before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Also at wake-up, CDR Skvortsov terminated his 9<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.     [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, FE-4 Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker continued the current week-long session of the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 2<sup>nd</sup> for Doug &amp; Shannon, 6<sup>th</sup> for Tracy, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Skvortsov configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 4<sup>th</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
 Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko undertook a session with the MedOps protocol MO-5, “Cardiovascular Evaluation during Graded Exercises” on the VELO cycle ergometer, a standard Russian fitness test, assisting each other as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).     [The 50-min assessment, supported by ground specialist tagup via VHF and telemetry monitoring (5:46am EDT), uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels.  For the graded exercise, the subject works the pedals after a prescribed program at load settings of 125, 150, and 175 watts for three minutes each.  Data output involves a kinetocardiogram, rheoplethysmogram, rheoencephalogram and a temporal pulsogram.]
 
 Later, Kornienko conducted his 8<sup>th</sup> data collection for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.     [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
 The CDR used the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to perform the monthly standard check on the SM (Service Module) cabin air, today looking for Carbon Monoxide, Acetic Acid and Nitrous Gases.     [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, etc.],
 
 In preparation of the planned installation of the PDGF (Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture) externally on the FGB (Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok) during US EVA-15 by Caldwell-Dyson &amp; Wheelock (currently on 8/5), Wheels configured the brackets for the Russian-built PDGF adapter (“rama” = frame), delivered on Progress 37P.     [The additional PDGF with its power/data cabling, the first on the RS (Russian Segment), will extend the “roving” range of the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) which moves itself inch-worm like from PDGF to PDGF.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson worked on the WPA (Water Processing Assembly), first taking samples of the Multifiltration Bed outflow plus Node-3 RIP (Rack Interface Panel), and later replaced both Multifiltration Bed ORUs (Orbit Replaceable Units).  For accessing the ORU, FE-4 Wheelock removed the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) Kabin enclosure &amp; later replaced it.     [TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer) samples of the WPA product water have shown that the water purification performance has been degrading since mid-April (although levels remained within limits).  Since the leading cause of water purification degradation is thought to be expended Multifiltration Beds, both of them were replaced today.  After the maintenance the ground activated WPA from the ground and processed again the next time the waste water tank is full.]
 
 In the DC1 (Docking Compartment), FE-3 terminated the discharge process on the first 825M3 Orlan battery pack in the ZU-S recharge unit and started it on the second set.
 
 Wrapping up their post-EVA closeout activities, Kornienko &amp; Yurchikhin returned EVA tools &amp; equipment to stowage, updating the IMS (Inventory Management System) appropriately.
 
 FE-4 Wheelock completed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes (current cue card: 24-0007E).
 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin performed periodic maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, changing out replaceable parts with new components, such as a filter insert (F-V), the urine receptacle (MP), the pretreat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pretreat &amp; water dispenser.  All old parts were discarded as trash.    [E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid), CrO<sub>3</sub> (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H<sub>2</sub>O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.]
 
 Fyodor subsequently also –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Completed the periodic transfer of condensate water to an RS (Russian Segment) EDV container for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis into oxygen &amp; (waste) hydrogen, filling the designated KOV (condensate water) EDV container from a CWC (Contingency Water Container).  When filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit  [the 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles are detected in the EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator],</li><li>Performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers], and</li><li>Conducted the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.</li></ul> 
 Activities completed by Douglas Wheelock included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>A session (his first) with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application  [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmember’s or flight surgeon’s request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies], and</li><li>Conducting the routine maintenance on the prime CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) unit (#1058), first replacing the battery, then zero-calibrating the instrument  [the CSA-CP is a passive cabin atmosphere monitor that provides quick response capability during a combustion event (fire). Its collected data are stored on a logger. Following zero calibration, the prime unit was re-deployed at the SM Central Post].</li></ul> 
 Shannon Walker –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Successfully completed the first activation and checkout &amp; functional test of the MELFI-3 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 3) in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).  Later it was deactivated,</li><li>Activated the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) and then worked on the SAME (Smoke Aerosol Measurement Experiment) payload, changing out the sample carousel, the alcohol wick and the thermal precipitator, followed by opening vent &amp; GN<sub>2</sub> (gaseous nitrogen) valves,</li><li>Configured the PCRF (Protein Crystallization Research Facility) by installing three maintenance units in PCRF and setting up the necessary cabling,</li><li>Continued the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) process she started yesterday by installing MEU B (Measurement Experiment Unit B) into the 1G IU (Incubator Unit) centrifuge Shannon installed into the CBEF; she then will install MEU B into the Micro G IU.</li></ul> 
 Sasha set up the Node-3 camcorder in a fixed position to capture a full-body side view of his workout on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) in order to meet the video requirement to record ARED exercise every 30 days. 
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-4, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.] 
 
 FE-4 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Wheels at ~8:45am, Shannon at ~12:05pm EDT.
 
 Payload Milestone:   An important milestone was completed today when 12 utilization racks were active at one time.  Over the course of the day a combination of 12 of the following 13 payload racks were active and conducting or preparing to conduct weekly science operations: ER1, ER2, ER3, ER4, ER6, CIR (Combustion Integration Rack), FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack), MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox), MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1), MELFI-2, MELFI-3, SAIBO and RYUTAI.  
 
 Kurs MRM1 Testing:  Following the Kurs cable installation task during RS EVA-25 this week, TsUP-Moscow performed a Kurs test from the FGB Kurs equipment to MRM1 antennas and did not receive good results due to incorrect uplink settings. Later the test was completed with the correct settings and successful results were achieved.
