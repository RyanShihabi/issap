ISS On-Orbit Status 04/15/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday �C Crew off duty.  Ahead:  Week 21 of Increment 30 (six-person crew).
 
HAPPY EASTER!  С праздником Пасхи!
 
Today the Eastern Orthodox Church, including Russia, observes Easter (Pasha), on the basis of the Julian calendar and the "paskhalias" �C i.e. special "paschal" lunar tables �C with khristosovanie traditions like triple kiss exchange and red eggs.
 
After breakfast, FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
Also during morning inspection, FE-2 Ivanishin conducted the periodic checkup of the circuit breakers &amp; fuses in the MRM-2 (Mini Research Module 2) Poisk.        [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 &amp; MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.  MRM2 &amp; MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.]
 
Anton completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.      [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
At ~12:10pm EDT, in observance of today’s Orthodox Easter, Oleg, Anatoly &amp; Anton had a 15-min telephone conversation with the Patriarch of Moscow, Kirill I, at TsUP-Moscow.
 
CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Anatoly at ~6:00am, Anton at ~7:35am, André at ~9:20am, Don at ~12:25pm, Dan at ~3:50pm, EDT.  
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5).     [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  Today’s SPRINT exercise called for CEVIS, with ARED+T2, T2, ARED+T2, CEVIS &amp; TK (Treadmill Kinematics) following in the next 5 days.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]
