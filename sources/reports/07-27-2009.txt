ISS On-Orbit Status 07/27/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  FD (Flight Day) 13 of STS-127/2J/A.   Underway:  Week 9 of Increment 20.  STS-127/Endeavour is ready for undocking.
 
  Crew sleep cycle:  Wake 3:33am, sleep 6:33pm EDT.
 
 Mission 2J/A’s EVA-5 was successfully completed.   Having begun at 7:33am EDT, the spacewalk was performed by MS1 Christopher Cassidy &amp; MS3 Thomas Marshburn, lasting until 12:19pm, i.e., for a duration of 4h 46m.    [MS1 &amp; MS3 began their “campout” (nachalo desaturatsiy = desaturation start) last night in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the CL (Crewlock) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe.  This morning, following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Cassidy &amp; Marshburn after spending the night on 10.2 psi, the A/L hatch was closed again by Barratt for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge (~5:53am) and prebreathe (~6:08am) in the EMUs.  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and MS1/MS3 switching to suit power, EVA-5 began at 7:33am.]
 
  During today’s EVA, the crew:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Reconfigured SPDM (Special      Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) thermal covers;</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Reconfigured the Z1 patch      panel to restore full redundancy to the CMGs (Control Moment Gyroscopes);      and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Installed video cameras on      the front &amp; back of the JEF (Japanese Exposed Facility).</li> </ul> 
  Due to suit consumables constraints, the S3 Zenith PAS (Payload Attach System) deployment was not attempted.  Instead, the crew accomplished the following get-ahead tasks:
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Installed a handrail and a      foot restraint socket on the JPM (Japanese Pressurized Module), </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Installed a gap spanner on      Node-2</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Tied down a cable on the      U.S. Laboratory, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Relocated a foot restraint      in preparation for STS-128/ISS-17A.</li> </ul> 
 [The JLE (JEM Logistics Module – Exposed Section) was unberthed yesterday from the JEF (JEM Exposed Facility) with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) and handed off to the SRMS (Shuttle Remote Manipulator System), which then berthed the JLE in the Orbiter PLB (Payload Bay) for return.  After berthing the JLE in the payload bay, ground controllers translated the MT (Mobile Transporter) from WS8 (Worksite 8) to WS4, and later operated the SSRMS to walk off from the MBS (Mobile Remote Servicer Base System) onto its base on Node-2 in preparation for undock.  Later, the SPDM body roll joint and dexterous arm #2 was maneuvered via ground control in preparation for SPDM arm #2 thermal blanket adjustments during today’s EVA-5. ]
 
  Additional activities by Mike Barratt today included –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">Supporting preparations      for the EVA-4 by Chris &amp; Tom (testing the camera equipment, assisting      with EMU purging, EMU pre-breathing, CL/Crewlock depress, and egress), and      </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3">After EVA-5 ingress,      taking care of the usual post-EVA tasks (photographing EMU gloves for      inspection, recharging EMUs with water, setting up METOX canisters for      regeneration, downloading D2Xs EVA photographs, recharging REBA batteries,      etc.).</li> </ul> 
  For the biomed experiment INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function), Barratt, Thirsk, De Winne and Tim Kopra collected dry saliva samples.    [IMMUNE protocol requires the collection to occur first thing post-sleep, before eating, drinking and brushing teeth, and all samples are stored at ambient temperature.  Along with NUTRITION (Nutritional Status Assessment),  INTEGRATED IMMUNE  samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects.]
  
  For FE-2 Wakata &amp; FE-4 Thirsk, the day began with the extended “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment for which Koichi &amp; Bob ingested an Alendronate pill before breakfast.    [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens will be tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  As part of the regular physical fitness check, Gennady &amp; Mike undertook the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular assessment during graded physical load on the VELO cycle ergometer, assisting each other in turn as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).     [The assessment uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels.  Measurements were telemetered down via VHF to RGS (Russian Groundsite) during two comm windows (3:55am &amp; 6:45am).  For the graded-load exercise, the subject works the pedals after a prescribed program at load settings of 125, 150, and 175 watts for three 
 
  CDR Padalka &amp; FE-3 Romanenko spent an hour on the TVIS treadmill for the periodic Russian PZE-MO-3 test for physical fitness evaluation, his second time, using the TVIS in unmotorized (manual control) mode and wearing the minutes each.  Data output involves a kinetocardiogram, rheoplethysmogram, rheoencephalogram and a temporal pulsogram.]Kardiokassette KK-2000 belt with three chest electrodes.    [The fitness test, controlled from the RSE-Med laptop, yields ECG (electrocardiogram) readings to the KK-2000 data storage device, later downlinked via the Regul (BSR-TM) payload telemetry channel.  Before the run, the KK-2000 was synchronized with the computer date/time readings.  For the ECG, the crewmembers worked out on the treadmill, first walking 3 min. up to 3.5 km/h, then running at a slow pace of 5-6 km/h for 2 min, at moderate pace of 6.5 km/h, followed by the maximum pace not exceeding 10 km/h, then walking again at gradually decreasing pace.]
 
  FE-2 Wakata closed the protective shutters of the Lab and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) science windows in preparation for the upcoming Shuttle departure and Progress 34P docking.
 
  Wakata also spent more time on handover activities with FE-2-20 Tim Kopra.
 
  In the COL CQ (Columbus Orbital Laboratory/Crew Quarters), Bob Thirsk made preparations for the installment of the new Colbert T2 (Treadmill #2).
 
  FE-3 Romanenko performed the periodic checkup behind ASU panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
  FE-5 DeWinne performed the regular service on the WPA (Water Processor Assembly), first offloading the WPA from WRS (Water Recovery System) Rack 1 into a CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodine, #2034) with the common H<sub>2</sub>O transfer hose (which took about 23 min) from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary Port, then flushing the system.
 
  In preparation for the planned major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the US CDRA (Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly), Frank also was to scout the station looking for a spare CDRA heater controller.    [After CDRA Bed 2 exhibited elevated temperatures which shut down the RPC (Remote Power Controller), the unit was switched to manual mode with a day/night cycle inhibit via uploaded PPL (Pre-Positioned Load) software patch, developed to allow automatic mode without power to primary heater string.  The software patch load plan is in work, and the station returned to nominal LiOH (Lithium Hydroxide) plan of two candles per day.]
 
  The FE-1 &amp; FE-2-20 conducted the PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) during programmed exercise on the CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) in the US Lab, with Tim Kopra the subject..  Readings were taken with the BP/ECG (blood pressure/electrocardiograph) and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.    [Mike Barratt assisted as CMO (Crew Medical Officer), taking Mike’s BP readings for the PFE protocol.  BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.]
 
  Before sleep time, Gennady set up the Russian MBI-12 SONOKARD payload and start his eighth experiment session, using a sports shirt from the SONOKARD kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.     [SONOKARD objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-4, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR). 
 
  Later, Bob transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
