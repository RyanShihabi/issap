Marrow: This morning a crewmember collected Breath and Ambient air samples for the Marrow study. Marrow looks at the effect of microgravity on bone marrow. It is believed that microgravity, like long-duration bed rest on Earth, has a negative effect on the bone marrow and the blood cells that are produced in the bone marrow.
Fluid Dynamics in Space (FLUIDICS): Today a crewmember installed the Fluidics hardware and initiated the session 5 autonomous science run. The measurement of liquid displacement within a sphere in microgravity relates to a given kinematic representation of a spacecraftâ€™s fuel tank. The FLUIDICS investigation evaluates the Center of Mass (CoM) position regarding a temperature gradient on a representation of a fuel tank. The observation of capillary wave turbulence on the surface of a fluid layer in a low-gravity environment can provide insights into measuring the existing volume in a sphere.
Lab Utility Outlet Panel (UOP)-4 Cable Reconfiguration: The crew worked to transfer loads from Lab UOP4 J4 to J3 connections and installed a 120 Volts Direct Current (VDC) Power / Ethernet Cable and Cobalt Brick on J4. This allows for a network connection through Ethernet on UOP4 J4 and enables troubleshooting of Payloads Joint Station LAN data with the ZBook Network Management System Laptop.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS): On Monday evening, robotics ground controllers powered up the MSS and maneuvered the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) to grapple the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) located on the U.S. Lab Payload and Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). Once the SPDM was grappled by the SSRMS, the SPDM was commanded to release the Lab PDGF and it was maneuvered to the Mobile Base System (MBS) and where it was commanded to grapple the MBS PDGF1. Now that the SPDM is located on MBS PDGF1, it is in a good configuration for the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) survey this evening.
