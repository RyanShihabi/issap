ISS On-Orbit Status 05/08/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sunday – crew off duty.    Ahead: Week 8 of Increment 27.
 
Upon wake-up, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator.      [Maxim Suraev installed these filters on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Alexandr inspects the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 9<sup>th</sup> for Ron, the 32<sup>nd</sup> for Paolo &amp; Cady.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
FE-5 Nespoli continued his 5<sup>th</sup> (FD180) and final suite of sessions with the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight &amp; Recovery), with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period.  Nespoli also started his 5<sup>th</sup> HRF (Human Research Facility) Generic 24-hr urine collection period, with samples deposited in MELFI.   Tonight, FE-6 Coleman readies the blood  draw equipment for Paolo whose blood collections begin tomorrow (5/9).        [For Pro K, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  The operational products for blood &amp; urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were revised some time ago, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
FE-2 Borisenko took ~15 min to transfer the latest crew video recording to SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for downlink to TsUP-Moscow.      [The Roskosmos “Videoblog” project, recorded by the Russian crewmembers at their convenience, began on 1/8, with frequent downlinks via OCA (not to exceed 300 Mb),] 
 
Later, Andrey conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.  FE-2 also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.     [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
FE-3 &amp; FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Paolo at ~4:35am, Ron at ~11:10am EDT.
 
At ~4:30am, Dmitri, Andrey &amp; Sasha powered up the amateur radio equipment in the SM (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) to conduct a ham session with faculty and students of the Irkutsk Physics &amp; Technology Institute (IrGTU).
 
At ~7:25am, the Russian crewmembers supported an amateur/ham radio pass with Great Patriotic War (WWII) veterans, faculty and students of Kursk University at the site of the Kursk Bulge Battle. 
 
Jobs listed for Kondratyev, Samokutyayev  &amp; Borisenko for today on the Russian discretionary “as time permits” task list were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Preparation of reportages (photo &amp; video material plus written stories) from the ISS to be placed on the official Roskosmos site to promote Russia’s manned space programs (max. file size 500 Mb),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining data on oceanic color bloom patterns in the Central-Eastern Atlantic waters, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera.</li></ul> 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2).
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
