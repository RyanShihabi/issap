ISS On-Orbit Status 11/19/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Saturday.    &gt;&gt;&gt;Today 42 years ago (1969), Apollo 12 landed on the moon with Charles “Pete” Conrad and Alan “Al” Bean in “Intrepid”, while Richard “Dick” Gordon remained in orbit in CSM “Yankee Clipper”.  It was the 2<sup>nd</sup> lunar landing of six and the 6<sup>th</sup> manned flight in the Apollo Program.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
First thing in Post-Sleep prior to eating, drinking &amp; brushing teeth, FE-3 Burbank performed another liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 3 for him).  The collections are made every other day for six days.       [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
After wakeup, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Also at wake-up, Ivanishin terminated his first experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
Burbank took over the BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment service, checking the running BCAT-6 payload for camera &amp; flashlight battery charge.  The Nikon D2Xs camera with EarthKAM software running with the Intervalometer on SSC-18 (Station Support Computer 18) is taking automated flash photography of Sample 3.      [After starting on 11/10, the camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking one photo every 2 hrs (changed today from 1 hr).  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6 Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.]
 
Again most of the work day was spent on Handover activities between the 27S &amp; 28S crewmembers, to familiarize the new Expedition 29/30 residents with onboard equipment and procedures.
 
As one of the Handover activities, FE-4 Volkov &amp; FE-1 Shkaplerov performed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~3:30pm EST.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle, normally done every 20 days, is currently performed four times more frequently (last time: 10/24 &amp; 10/25).]
 
Shkaplerov, Ivanishin &amp; Volkov performed Day 3 service on the 28S-delivered Russian bioengineering experiments.     
[In particular, Anton, Anatoly &amp; Sergey �C
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Removed the BIO-8 PLAZMIDA payload from the KRIOGEM-03cooler (+4 degC), relocated it to the TBU thermostat-controlled container (+37 degC), activated it for a while, then turned it off and returned it to the KRIOGEM-03,
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Prepared &amp; started Kit 2 of the BTKh-35 MEMBRANA experiment,
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Mixed a new sample (#3) of the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment in the KT thermal enclosure in the GB/Glavboks-S (Glovebox-S) and transferred it to the TBU-V (+29 degC), and
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Took photographs of the BTKh-44 CALCIUM BIOEKOLOGIYA cases.] 
 
FE-5 Furukawa had 2h 20m set aside for printing out new SODF (Station Operation Data File) procedures and updating the EMER-1 and EMER-2 books with these pages.       [There are 6 EMER-1 books (SM, each Soyuz, Lab, FGB, Node-2) and 3 EMER-2 books (SM, FGB, Lab).  They are updated regularly with changing station configuration and crew size.]
 
Later, Satoshi used the CDM (Carbon Dioxide Monitor), CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) and two CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (Oxygen) instruments to take readings of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> (Carbon Dioxide) in the SM and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory).  Also checked were battery charges.  CDM received a new battery (#1206).       [O<sub>2</sub> measurements in SM: 21.5% (both instruments), in COL: 21.5% (#1043) &amp; 21.6% (#1048).  CO<sub>2</sub> measurements in SM: 0.28%; in COL: 0.29%.]
 
In preparation for his return to gravity next Monday, Sergey Volkov undertook the first part of his 5<sup>th</sup> and final exercise/training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the TVIS treadmill, with Anton Shkaplerov assisting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Medical telemetry monitoring on the ground was at 4:33am.  The activity was then closed out.  Part 2 follows tomorrow.        [The assessments, lasting one hour each, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground sites, uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -30, -35 and -40 mmHg for five min. each, then -25, -35, and -40 mmHg (Torr) for 10 min. each plus 30mmHg for 5 min. while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure, medically monitored with the Gamma-1M hardware.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
After FE-3 Burbank installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances), Dan worked with Mike Fossum on the rack, configuring it for another ground-controlled experiment/research run.  With the Lab camcorder adjusted to view CIR live from the Node-1 side and after verifying the main &amp; auxiliary RPCs (Remote Power Controllers) to be open plus touch temperatures within limits, Mike &amp; Dan removed &amp; replaced a manifold bottle on one of four manifolds (B) in front of the Optics Bench.        [Steps included opening the upper doors, removing CIR manifold bottle B #2024 containing 40% O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen), 60% N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) at 160 psia pressure remaining and replaced it with manifold bottle B #2017 containing 40% O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen), 60% He (helium), then placing the manual vent valve in VENT position, GIP valve lever in Up (open) position, closing the upper rack doors again, turning on two switches, and notifying POIC of rack readiness.]
 
Later, Mike &amp; Dan worked on the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System 2) in Node-3, removing the ARFTA (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly), draining it into with the Russian Kompressor-M into an EDV-U container, performing a leak check, cleaning it and replacing it in WRS-2.      [The recycle tank was then to be filled via the refill method using the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) depress hose which was later removed again, along with the tank’s vent adapter.] 
 
Afterwards, CDR &amp; FE-3 filled the WSTA (Waste Storage Tank Assembly) to top off the Recycle Tank, then reconfigured the ARFTA with QD (Quick Disconnect) hose from the periodic backfill mode to UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) processing mode.     [With ARFTA indicating Full, the WSTA was filled from EDV to 70% and left connected.]
 
Ivanishin performed his first periodic routine maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, changing out the pre-treat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pre-treat &amp; water dispenser.  All old parts were trashed by Volkov for disposal in Soyuz 27S (Orbital Module), and the IMS (Inventory Management System) was updated.       [E-K contains five liters of pre-treat solution, i.e., a mix of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (sulfuric acid), CrO<sub>3</sub> (chromium oxide, for oxidation and purple color), and H<sub>2</sub>O (water).  The pre-treat liquid is mixed with water in the DKiV dispenser and used for toilet flushing.]
 
Sergey had ~1h20m reserved for loading excessed hardware and trash on the Soyuz 27S Orbital Module for disposal (atmospheric burn-up).
 
Anatoly also conducted a familiarization review of the Russian “Istochnik-M” (source, spring) telemetry reception &amp; recording (SPR TMI) system in the SM which will be used during the Soyuz re-entry on 11/21.     [Istochnik-M enables the ISS to receive data telemetered from Soyuz spacecraft during return to Earth and record it on the SPR telemetry system.  The equipment, including the Istochnik TM station, power amplifiers, power supply, USB software sticks and cables, captures the telemetry through the “Sputnik” amateur (ham) radio antenna and transfers it to a laptop display where the crew is able to immediately tell if a good separation of the three Soyuz modules occurred during Soyuz descent operations.]
 
FE-4 Volkov used the standard ECOSFERA equipment, set up yesterday for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 microbial experiment, to inspect and evaluate the samples collected overnight in Media 1 &amp; Media 2 Petri dishes in Kit #A24 for cultivation, with the POTOK air filtration unit deactivated.  Afterwards, Sergey recharged the experiment’s battery and then set up the equipment for more sampling tomorrow.        [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge, the sample collection is being performed in two stages.  After today‘s sampling, the ECOSFERA battery pack is being recharged overnight for tomorrow’s Stage 2 for sampling to Kit #А25 Petri dishes.]
 
Anton Shkaplerov completed his first data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.         [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
FE-1 also checked out proper MKSD Control &amp; Data Acquisition Module communications between the BSPN Payload Server and the RSS1 laptop, then copied science &amp; service data, accumulated from the GFI-17 Molniya-GAMMA (“Lightning-GAMMA”) experiment mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28, over to external media (16 GB flash card).  Later (~1:40pm EST), he initiated their downlink from the RSK1 laptop to the ground via OCA.       [GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.]
 
Anatoly Ivanishin undertook his first session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.         [A crewmember stood by to assist FE-2 in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
FE-5 Furukawa filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).        [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
Later, Satoshi worked in Lab and Node-2, tearing down the ISL PCS (Integrated Station LAN Portable Computer System) laptop Ethernet cables from their UIPs (Utility Interface Panels, Green A1 in Lab, Violet C1 in Node-2), stowed them away and removed the “FOR PCS” labels from the panels.
 
On the CEVIS cycle ergometer device, the Japanese Flight Engineer reconfigured the current isolator setups to reduce wire rope tension, removing the installed improvised sock balls from the four isolators and making new balls using only one pair of crew socks each.       [The new sock balls must not fill the entire volume of the isolator.]
 
Dan Burbank removed his CEVIS PCMCIA (Portable Computer Memory Card International Adapter) memory card from the SSC (Station Support Computer) used for receiving the ground uplink of his CEVIS exercise protocol.
 
Continuing the obligatory CMS (Countermeasures Systems) overview which is required of each new crewmember prior to the first physical exercised session, Dan Burbank today observed Mike Fossum using the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill.
 
The six-member crew joined in the new Russian round of Simvolika (Symbolika) activities, stamping and signing ~20 Russian Postal Service envelopes with the Expedition 29 insignia and the note “Sochi.ru 2014” to be returned with Sergey, Mike &amp; Satoshi in the Soyuz TMA-02M/27S Descent Module on 11/21. 
 
Before sleeptime, Shkaplerov will prepare the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his first Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
At ~12:55am EST, Satoshi Furukawa had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
CDR, FE-3 &amp; FE-5 had their standard weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Satoshi at ~10:15am, Mike at ~11:45am, Dan at ~12:00pm EST (his 3<sup>rd</sup> after coming on board).
 
WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.     [The new card (29-0002F) lists 34 CWCs (517.6 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (7 CWCs with 217.5 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria;  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 19.1 L), 7 empty bags;  3. Iodinated water (12 CWCs with 186.4 L; also 3 expired bags with 59.1 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 15.3 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-4/2x), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2)
