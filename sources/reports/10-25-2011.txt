ISS On-Orbit Status 10/25/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
After wakeup, CDR Fossum checked the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment for camera battery charge and later in the day performed additional checks on the payload, looking for crystals, changing camera battery, downloading images and restarting the Intervalometer for automated flash photography.      [The camera is running for a total of 7 days, taking a photo of the turbid Sample 1 every hour.  While Sample 1 is running, crystal checks on Samples 6-10 will be performed each day.  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6-Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.]
 
FE-5 Furukawa completed his 2<sup>nd</sup> session with the U.S. PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol as subject, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on BP (blood pressure) &amp; ECG (electrocardiogram) during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with BP/ECG equipment and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.  CDR Fossum assisted as Operator/CMO.  The BP/ECG recordings were later transferred from the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) via USB thumb drive to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for downlink to the ground.        [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.] 
 
Satoshi also serviced the CGBA-5/CSI-05 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5 / Science Insert-05) Plant Habitat experiment, deactivating the payload, decabling it to gain access to its interior, removing the 6 used germination flasks, planting 3 new germination flasks, recabling the payload and restoring CSI-05 to operation.
 
FE-4 Volkov terminated the overnight repress of the cabin interior with fresh O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) from Progress 42P SrPK stores.
 
Volkov also completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  Sergey will terminate the process at ~5:15pm EDT.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday.  (Done last: 10/3 &amp; 10/4).       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.]
 
After conducting, at day break, a leak check on the EB vacuum chamber of the new KPT-21 PK-3+ Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall-3 plus) Telescience payload, Sergey configured the RS (Russian Segment) STTS communications system for working in the MRM2 Poisk module, then ran another KPT-21 experiment session.  Later, FE-4 copied and downlinked data &amp; log files, returned the STTS comm system to nominal and checked EB vacuum chamber hermeticity afterwards and before sleeptime (any pressure increase above the vacuum should stay within 5 mmHg).        [Main objective of PK-3 is to continue previous plasma crystal experiments, aimed at studying features of plasma including the critical points, where the temperature and pressure at which the liquid and gaseous phases of a substance become identical.  Plasma, or collections of charged particles, is the most common state of matter in the universe.  In microgravity, large 3-dimensional plasma crystals can be grown, allowing better observation of their structure and basic processes, which will provide a better understanding of plasma.  Under Earth conditions, gravity “squeezes” the plasma crystal and it becomes 2-D, not 3-D.  Experiments in space aboard the ISS allow researchers to see the real property of the crystals.]
 
CDR Fossum prepared the EDR (European Drawer Rack) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for subsequent maintenance, disconnecting the EDR laptop from the upper UDP (Utility Distribution Panel), installing protective connector caps, then coiling and fixing the detached cable to the rack front with Velcro.
 
Afterwards, Mike had ~4h15m allotted for the major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of removing the MCA VGA (Major Constituent Analyzer / Verification Gas Assembly) from AR1 (Atmosphere Revitalization Rack 1) in the US Lab and installing it instead in Node-3 in AR-2.      [The MSA (Mass Spectrometer Assembly) and DCA (Data &amp; Control Assembly) have already been removed from the LAB MCA.]
 
Volkov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Sergey also conducted his 2<sup>nd</sup> onboard session of the Russian MedOps assessment MO-12, (“Study of the Veins in the Lower Extremities”), using the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex with orthogonal leads which Oleg Kotov had installed in the SM in February 2010.      [After loading the RSE-med laptop with the Cardiomed software, Sergey set up the equipment, which involves KARDIOMED-TsB, KARDIOMED-KP, KARDIOMED-PMO and KARDIOMED-KRM assemblies with ECG (electrocardiogram) electrodes in a HOLTER monitor harness, a PLETISMOGRAF (Plethysmograph) instrument with calf measuring cuff, pneumatic hose, thigh occlusion cuff, hand pump &amp; valve, and a DOPPLER complex.  A Plethysmograph (sometimes called a “body box”) is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or the whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains).]
 
Furukawa performed the periodic (approx. weekly) WRS (Water Recovery System) sampling in Node-3 using the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), after first initializing the software and priming (filling) the TOCA water sample hose.     [After the approximately 2-hr TOCA analysis, results were transferred to an SSC (Station Support computer) laptop via USB drive for downlink, and the data were also logged.]

With no crew aboard ISS, the ISL Router may then not be able to be re-powered if connected to a UOP.  The new power reconfiguration will allow ISL Router to be powered directly from a UOP RPC (Remote Power Controller), i.e., the ground, utilizing one of the UOP power bypass cables].</li></ul> 
Before sleeptime, Satoshi also set up his 2<sup>nd</sup> experiment with the onboard JAXA DK (Diagnostic Kit), to continue for 3 straight days with a series of medical diagnostic measurements including cardio/heart, brainwave, and oxygen measurements.     [Starting tonight with the 2<sup>nd</sup> (of 3) oxygen level measurement with the Pulse Oximeter, Satoshi will record brainwaves overnight during sleep, followed tomorrow by Cardiograph measurements &amp; Heart Sound recordings through Thursday (10/27).  These measurements will then be repeated one more times later during the Increment.  Purpose of these activities is to perform diagnostic measurements with medical equipment in order to evaluate the equipment for development of a future diagnostic system on board.  DK includes: Medical laptop, USB Camera, Pulse Oximeter, Stethoscope, Sleep Monitor and Digital Walk Holter/Electrocardiograph and Electroencephalograph (for brain waves).]
 
Sergey Volkov had another hour set aside for loading waste and other excessed cargo on the resupply ship-turned-trash can Progress 42P, while logging the moves in the IMS (Inventory Management System) database.
 
Before Presleep tonight, the CDR will turn on the MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Mike will turn MPC routing off again.       [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
At ~1:00pm EDT, Sergey had his standard weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR).  Earlier, Mike set up the video camera in Node-3 to cover the workout sessions of himself, Sergey &amp; Satoshi on the ARED, to meet the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.
 
Tasks listed for Sergey Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
