ISS On-Orbit Status 06/08/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
  
 At wake-up, CDR Skvortsov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Working on ER4 (EXPRESS Rack 4), FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson swapped the RHDD (Removable Hard Disk Drive) in the DECLIC (Device for the Study of Critical Liquids &amp; Crystallization) experiment’s ELL (Electronics Locker) with a new one.
 
 Afterwards, FE-2 had 2 hrs reserved for the periodic inspection &amp; audit of PEPS (Portable Emergency Provisions) on board, checking PFEs (Portable Fire Extinguishers, PBAs (Portable Breathing Apparatus), EHTKs (Extension Hose Tee Kits) and QDMA (Quick-Don Mask Assembly) harnesses.     [There are 2 PFEs, 1 PBA, 1 QDMA, 1 EHTK in Node-1, 1 PFE, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs 2 EHTKs in Node-2, 1 PFE, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs, 1 EHTK in Node-3, 1 PFE, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs in A/L, 2 PFEs, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs, 1 EHTK in the Lab, 2 PFEs, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs in JPM, 1 PFE in JLP, and 2 PFEs, 2 PBAs, 2 QDMAs in COL.]
 
 In the SM (Service Module), CDR Skvortsov &amp; FE-3 Kornienko uninstalled the Russian VB-3 VELO cycle ergometer and replaced it with an upgraded model, VB-3M, delivered by Progress 36P and stowed in MRM2 Poisk.      [The outfitting was supported by ground specialist tagup.  A functional checkout test followed after the new bike was connected to the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system.  The old VB-3 will be disposed of.]
 
 In the MRM1 module, with BITS2-12, VD-SU control mode and power supplies turned off, Skvortsov later uninstalled and removed electronics equipment (ABU SSVP, BUP-2, TA082/BNU) of the automatic control system used by Rassvet for the rendezvous, approach &amp; docking phase.
 
 After clearing access to BLB (BioLab) in the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) for a photo session, Caldwell-Dyson shot photographs of the inside of the BLB HM (Handling Mechanism) working volume, then installed magnetic foils in TCUs (Temperature Control Units) 1 &amp; 2 for accommodating the AECs (Advanced Experiment Containers) of the forthcoming TripleLux-B  payload activity.  In TCU-2, Tracy also replaced damaged Velcro straps on the TCU tray.    [TripleLux-B (Gene, Immune &amp; Cellular Responses to Single &amp; Combined Space Flight Conditions – B) studies the effects of space flight and radiation on the immune function of vertebrate and invertebrate cells in microgravity through induction of gene activation, phagocytosis, and DNA repair.  For the vertebrate portion of the study, rodent macrophages (large white blood cells) will be tested to determine their ability to phagocytize (ingest foreign material) zymosan (an insoluble carbohydrate that serves as an analogue of bacteria) in micro-G.  For the invertebrate portion the ability of Mytilus edulis (blue mussel) hemocytes (cellular component of invertebrate blood) to activate phagocytosis in micro-G will be examined.  TripleLux-B will utilize the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and BLB facilities, requiring two sessions of approximately 75 hours to complete operations.  Video containing the data of the TripleLux-B activities on orbit will be downloaded to Earth following investigation completion.]
 
 Later, FE-2 installed WAICO (Waving &amp; Coiling of Arabidopsis at Different Gravity Levels) RECs (Reference Experiment Containers) on BLB Rotors A &amp; B.
 
 Also in COL, Tracy adjusted the friction torque of the VCA2 (Video Camera Assembly 2) camcorder in the Stbd Cone area.
 
 Other work tackled by Tracy included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Mating OGS (Oxygen Generation System) Quick Disconnect connectors on the AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) rack in Node-3 to support ground-controlled activities,</li><li>Swapping the currently used GC/DMS (Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer) Air Quality Monitor (#1002) with a new unit (#1004) delivered on ULF-4, then powering up SSC12 (Station Support Computer 12) for the system,</li><li>Inspecting, activating &amp; checking the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) for acceptable humidity &amp; temperature levels in the sample chamber, followed – after Go from POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center/Huntsville) – by opening the vent valve to establish vacuum in the chamber for the CSLM (Coarsening in Solid-Liquid Mixtures )-2 experiment  [this was the first of four CSLM SPU (Sample Processing Unit) vent cycles, an 8-hr evacuation of the sample chamber], and</li><li>Downloading stored SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight) data from TJ Creamer’s Actiwatch and initializing her own Actiwatch using the HRF (Human Research Facility) PC1, then decabling the Actiwatch Reader, stowing the hardware, and powering off the PC (Portable Computer).</li></ul> 
 FE-3 Kornienko meanwhile –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Conducted another sun-glint observation session with the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) experiment from SM window #9, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with a NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloading the data to laptop RSE1 for subsequent downlink via OCA  [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere],</li><li>Removed the BKP &amp; AI boxes of the SRK Radiation Monitoring System from behind panel 447 in the starboard SM CQ (Crew Quarters) cabin, which Skvortsov had inspected on 6/3,</li><li>Restored BITS onboard telemetry &amp; VD-SU control mode to activity and then supported Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator reactivation by TsUP-Moscow by throwing a switch and monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating  [measurements were taken twice, 3-4 minutes apart, with the temperature probe of the Elektronika MultiMeter.  If BD temperature exceeded 50 degC, Elektron had to be turned off.  The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup],</li><li>Completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.],</li><li>Took the periodic Russian PZE-MO-3 test for physical fitness evaluation, spending an hour on the TVIS treadmill in unmotorized (manual control) mode and wearing the Kardiokassette KK-2000 belt with three chest electrodes  [the fitness test, controlled from the RSE-Med laptop, yields ECG (electrocardiogram) readings to the KK-2000 data storage device, later downlinked via the Regul (BSR-TM) payload telemetry channel.  Before the run, the KK-2000 was synchronized with the computer date/time readings.  For the ECG, the crewmember rests for 5 min., then works out on the treadmill, first walking 3 min. up to 3.5 km/h, then running at a slow pace of 5-6 km/h for 2 min, at moderate pace of 6.5 km/h for 2 min, followed by the maximum pace not exceeding 10 km/h for 1 min, then walking again at gradually decreasing pace to 3.5 km/h] and later</li><li>Performed the regular weekly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.</li></ul> 
 Continuing the current round of the monthly preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Alexander inspected &amp; cleaned “Group A” ventilator fans &amp; grilles in the SM.
 
 At ~12:25pm EDT, Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko downlinked messages of greetings &amp; well-wishing for two PAO TV events, - (1) the upcoming “Russia Day” Holiday and its celebration, and (2) for the graduates of V.M. Komarov High School in Star City upon their graduation.      [The Russia Day celebration will take place on 6/12 on Moscow’s Red Square from 7:00pm-11:00pm.  About 30,000 youth activists and regular spectators, mostly in the 30s, are expected to show up on Red Square.  The current year of 2010 features the 65<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Russia’s Victory in the Great Patriotic War, the acceptance of a relay by Russia to conduct Winter Olympic Games, and also the Year of the Teacher.  All these themes will be reflected in a show of grand scale that is now in preparation, with a live concert with celebrity stars to be aired on TV channels Rossia 1 and Muz-TV, and on the Russian Radio.  Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko will address the celebrants with greetings from space, ”throwing” a star as a gift for people to make a wish.]
 
 The crew was scheduled for their regular weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Misha at ~10:40am, Sasha at ~12:00pm, Tracy at ~3:15pm EDT.
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on the TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-2, FE-3), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).
 
 Reboosts Update:  Two single-burn reboost maneuvers were performed successfully last night as scheduled, executed by the four Progress 37P mid-ring thrusters, one orbit apart, to fine-tune orbital phasing for both 23S Soyuz &amp; 38P Progress launch conditions.
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Reboost 1: TIG (Time of Ignition) – 8:10pm EDT; burn duration: 9m 40s;  </li><li>Reboost 2: TIG – 9:45pm; burn duration: 7m 15s; </li><li>Total delta-V: 1.42 m/s (4.66 ft/s) [predicted: 1.4 m/s (4.6 ft/s)]; </li><li>Mean altitude increase after both burns: 2.45 km (1.32 nmi) [predicted: 2.41 km (1.30 nmi)].</li> </ul> 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Pristina, Kosovo (Pristina is the capital and largest city of Kosovo.  The current population is estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000 and is the educational and cultural center of Kosovo.  CEO has few images of this city in its database.  Documenting land use and urban boundaries.  The city should have been slightly right of track), Nicosia, Cyprus (Nicosia is the capital and largest city of both Cyprus and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  It is located on the river Pedieos and situated almost in the center of the island.  Looking slightly right of orbit track), Tripoli, Libya (this capital city of 1.69 million has been occupied since its founding in the 7th century BC.  It lies on a gentle bulge in the Libyan coastline.  As ISS approached the Mediterranean coast from the NW, the crew should have found this low-contrast target near nadir), Harare, Zimbabwe (Harare is the administrative and commercial center of the country of Zimbabwe.  Documenting the urban area and surroundings), Slate Islands Impact Crater, Ontario (the Slate Islands were formed by a meteor impact approximately 450 million years ago.  The entire impact structure is approximately 32 kilometers in diameter.  Looking for the Slate Islands near the northern shore of Lake Superior.  Overlapping nadir-viewing mapping frames of the islands were requested), and St. Paul Rocks islets, Brazil (HMS Beagle Site:  CEO staff is working with the Beagle Project – a group that is rebuilding a replica of the HMS Beagle.  They plan to revisit the course of the Beagle.  CEO is participating in this project by having images taken of places Darwin visited.  Darwin and the Beagle briefly visited this isolated, equatorial Atlantic site in early February of 1832.  This tiny group of islets and rocks is also known as the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago.  The islands are of particular interest to geologists as they expose rocks associated with the Earth's mantle above sea level.  Looking to the right of track for the islands as ISS approached the area from the NW.  With good light and few clouds the crew should have been able to photograph all of them in a mapping pass).
