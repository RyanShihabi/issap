Ocular Health:   Gerst and Wiseman setup ultrasound-2 hardware for use in Gerst’s FD 120 (day 3 of 3) eye ultrasound exam.  The crew configured camera equipment, Ultrasound 2, and performed an echocardiogram with guidance from the Ocular Health ground team.  The Ocular Health protocol calls for a systematic gathering of physiological data to characterize the risk of microgravity-induced visual impairment/intracranial pressure in ISS crewmembers. Researchers believe that the measurement of visual, vascular and central nervous system changes over the course of this experiment and during the subsequent post-flight recovery will assist in the development of countermeasures, clinical monitoring strategies, and clinical practice guidelines.
Space Headaches:   Wiseman completed a Space headaches questionnaire.  The objectives of this study are to obtain in-flight data allowing evaluation of the prevalence and characteristics of headache in microgravity
Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Preparations:  Wiseman and Gerst worked on configuring EVA tools in preparation for upcoming EVA for Pump Module (PM) relocation and Mobile Transporter Relay Assembly (MTRA) installation, scheduled for October 7th.  Wiseman also initiated a battery charge-discharge-charge cycle for some of the EVA batteries.
