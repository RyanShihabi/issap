SlingShot: Today crewmembers installed two Slingshot deployables (SEOPS-Quantum Radar -1 and -2s) on to the outer hatch of the Cygnus Spacecraft. Also installed in a deployable slot is the UbiquityLink-1 orbit to ground communications hardware. The two passive optical reflector satellites will be released after Cygnus moves away from the ISS. SEOPS’ SlingShot is a small satellite deployment system that fits inside the Cygnus spacecraft’s Passive Common Berthing Mechanism (PCBM). SlingShot can accommodate up to eighteen satellites that are deployed post Cygnus unberth.
Cygnus Departure Preparations: Today, the crew installed the starboard and port Controller Panel Assemblies (CPAs), re-installed the Node 1 Nadir thermal cover and closed the Node 1 Nadir hatch. The crew then completed the Pressure Management Device (PMD) setup in preparation for vestibule depress. Cygnus unberth is scheduled for tomorrow morning with release at 16:10 GMT (10:10 AM CT).
