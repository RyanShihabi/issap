ISS On-Orbit Status 05/28/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
  
 &gt;&gt;&gt;Today 55 years ago, the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan was officially established by the Soviet Union (1955).  Under its then-name Tyura Tam, it became the world’s first space launch operations center, making history with Sputnik, Yuri Gagarin and numerous other important Firsts in space, launching satellites, space stations, lunar &amp; planetary probes, space shuttle Buran, and cosmonauts.  Happy Birthday, Baikonur!&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
 At wake-up, FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-3 again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-1 Skvortsov did the daily morning check on the TBU Universal Bioengineering Thermostat container and reported its current internal temperature to TsUP-Moscow. 
 
 After wake-up, FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued their new week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s 6<sup>th</sup>, Tracy’s 3<sup>rd</sup>, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 At day begin, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, FE-5 Noguchi &amp; FE-6 Creamer completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
 Based on his initial MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) insert time yesterday, Soichi Noguchi closed out his last Bisphosphonates program’s 24-hr urine collections after ~4:15am EDT this morning.      [The operational products for Blood &amp; Urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads have been revised, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.
 
 At wake-up, TJ Creamer began his FD180 (Flight Day 180) session of the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) medical protocol, his 5<sup>th</sup> on board run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test (not sampling).     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Noguchi replaced the current SLT (System Laptop), an A31p ThinkPad, with a newer T61p (SLT4) and deployed a second T61p (SLT5), followed by activation and checkout of both machines.
 
 Afterwards, Soichi spent ~1.5 hrs on cleaning up the Kibo laboratory, separating trash &amp; non-trash items and consolidating/relocating JEM items for creating efficient new stowage room.     [Activities included restowing all FPEF (Fluid Physics Experiment Facility) connectors, re-organizing payload components and relocating the Sabatier equipment.] 
 
 For more bioscience sample preservation during the new Stage ULF-4 period, Noguchi continued stocking MELFI-2 with “ice bricks”, retrieving another 16 of them (+4 degC) for insertion into Dewar 4, Trays A, B, C &amp; D (two bricks each into the two sections of each tray), as he had done for Dewar 1 on 5/26.    [Two ¼-box modules were relocated in Tray C to Sections 1 &amp; 2, and one ½-box module in Section 3+4.]
 
 FE-1 Skvortsov installed the hardware of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 to conduct another observations run of Earth images and spectra, then took down the equipment and stowed it.     [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment is designed for spectral observations of the Earth atmosphere and surface, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
 FE-3 Kornienko performed periodic service of the RS (Russian Segment) radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), recording data from five detectors in the Bubble-dosimeter reader and rearranging some dosimeters.     [Eight Bubble dosimeter detectors (A09-A16) are positioned at their exposure locations around the RS.  Measurements were taken today from detectors A09 &amp; A13-A16.  Their measurements (exposure duration, bubble quantity, dose) were recorded in the Reader on PCMCIA memory card and reported to TsUP via log sheet over OCA.  The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.]
 
 In the DC1 Docking Compartment, Mikhail Kornienko also serviced the BTKh-26 KASKAD (Cascade) payload, removing the incubated samples from the KRIOGEM-03 thermostat-controlled container, mixing them up in the KT thermostatic enclosure and placed them in the KR container, with Skvortsov again taking photographs.      [The empty KT was unplugged from its power outlet and stowed.  KASKAD investigates cultivation processes of micro-organism, animal &amp; human cells in microgravity.] 
 
 Misha also conducted the periodic (currently daily) checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 Later, FE-3 completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Kornienko then performed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 CDR Kotov worked on the Russian auxiliary VKS laptops RSK1 &amp; RSS1, installing a new uplinked software application for automatic updating their virus definition files when the machines are connected to the LAN network.     [RSK1 is updated at every crew login; for RSS1 it is once a day at 11:00pm (if network comm is down, the process is terminated).]
 
 ATV RGPS tests continue.  Oleg set up the RSE1 laptop for the third activity program (of four) of the ongoing four-day tests of multipath impacts on the ASN-M Satellite Navigation System.     [Each program has its own specific batch of settings selected by Oleg for the three NPM receiver module units.  For each activity program, the redundant NPM units are being monitored by Oleg for communication status &amp; absence of errors approximately every 2 hrs.  Test duration is four days, and the test started on 5/25.  Background:  The ASN-M will be needed for the proximity operations of the second ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle), expected in December of this year.  For the multipath/interference tests of the ATV RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System) in the current joint ISS-MRM2-Soyuz TMA-18/22S configuration, some station systems will be powered down (due to reduced power availability from the solar arrays).  The USOS windows were shuttered for the attitude maneuver required to test for multipathing impacts of various SARJ/BGA/TRRJ (Solar Alpha Rotary Joint/Beta Gimbal Assembly/Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint) configurations and possible shadowing of the ASN-M antennas which are used for ATV dockings.  The SARJs are parked during the test, and several parked and autotracking BGA configurations will be used.] 
 
 At the SM (Service Module)’s Central Post, Kotov tied the malfunctioning KUBIK-3 temperature-controlled incubator, which had not worked at the EDR (European Drawer Rack), into the RS (Russian Segment) power net for another function/nonfunction verification by Caldwell-Dyson, then disconnected it.
 
 Tracy then returned KUBIK-3 to the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) along with its bonding strap (for grounding) and power cable.  Afterwards, FE-2 restowed items needed for the troubleshooting in COL.
 
 Other activities by Tracy included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Termination, in the US Airlock, of the post-mission discharge cycle on the EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) batteries, second batch, for maintenance &amp; stowage requirements, in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly),</li><li>Working with TJ Creamer for ~2h20m on transferring, unpacking &amp; stowing US cargo delivered on the Russian MRM1 Poisk module,</li><li>Undertaking another periodic relocation of the TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly, the primary radiation measurement tool in the ISS, moving it from Node-3 Bay F3 (where it had been since its transfer from SM Panel 327 on 4/22) to Lab S4,</li><li>Continuing for another ~30 min the search for empty TOCA WWBs (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer / Waste Water Bags), without which no TOCA runs can be performed (since the current bag is full),</li><li>Completing the monthly maintenance of the T2 advanced treadmill, checking its components, pin alignment, rack centering and the snubber jam nut witness marks  [witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- &amp; Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm; their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off], and</li><li>Removing the hard drive with the EXPRESS Payload Simulator application from the T61p laptop #1068) at ER1 (EXPRESS Rack 1) in the Lab which she set up on 5/24 for five days of testing by the PD (Payload Developer), and then reconfiguring the ER1 laptop.</li></ul> 
 In the COL, after moving stowage items at Bay A2 out of the way, Creamer serviced the ESA BLB LSM (Biolab Life Support Module) incubator by replacing its biological isolation filters and cold spot sponge seal with fresh spares.   Stowage items were then restored to their original locations.
 
 Also in COL, Timothy connected the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop to a 28V power outlet on the left utility distribution panel for COL-CC (Columbus Control Center) to command downlinking results from the recent (5/5) PASSAGES experiment from memory card.  Later, TJ removed the PCMCIA card from the EPM laptop and stowed it in the PASSAGES kit which he then packed into the NeuroSpat Kit.
 
 Afterwards, TJ took IMV (Intermodule Ventilation) flow measurements for specific locations in Node-3 (to Lab), Airlock (to Node-1 IMV), and RS (to Node-3 IMV).     [Measurements were taken with the electronic Velocicalc instrument at Lab IMV Aft Port outlet, Node-1 linear diffusers, and Node-3 Ovhd (Overhead) Port Diffusers.  Background:  During recent Progress O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) represses, there has been a higher than normal ppO<sub>2</sub> (partial pressure O<sub>2</sub>) gradient between the SM and Node-3.  The ppCO<sub>2</sub> gradient between the SM and USOS (US Segment) is also higher than usual.  To troubleshoot a possible degradation in ventilation flow between SM and Node-3, today’s airflow measurements will be reviewed by ground engineers.]
 
 TJ then moved on to the Kibo JPM for more measurements of IMV air flow speeds,- at its Ovhd Aft inlet, Stbd (Starboard) Aft inlet and Stbd Fwd outlet.
 
 Oleg Kotov had another ~2.5h for stowing return cargo in the Soyuz 21S Descent Module.  Excessed items &amp; trash go into the Orbital Module, to be jettisoned for its own atmospheric entry.
 
 Caldwell-Dyson went through the regular monthly session (her second) of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh her CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on Nosebleed (her first on Eye Treatment).   [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] 
 
 The crewmembers continued their activity with Simvolika mementos, the traditional Russian commemorative items treasured as gifts, today again cancelling postage stamps and signing 60 envelopes for the Russian Postal Service (GRO) with a special template.     [Participation by the US crew was part of their voluntary “job jar” activity list for today.]
 
 Noguchi &amp; Caldwell-Dyson filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).    [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 Oleg, Soichi &amp; TJ again had ~60 min set aside for regular crew departure preparations, working on the standard end-of-increment personal cleanup &amp; packing preparatory to their return.     [It is usual for crewmembers to be granted reduced workdays for making their departure preparations, as their return date approaches.]
 
 At ~4:00am EDT, Skvortsov, Kotov &amp; Kornienko linked up with TsUP/Moscow stowage specialists via S-band to conduct the weekly RS IMS tagup, discussing inventory &amp; stowage issues, equipment locations and cargo transfers.
 
 At ~4:15am, the crew held the regular (nominally weekly) tagup with the Russian Flight Control Team (GOGU), including Shift Flight Director (SRP), at TsUP via S-band/audio, phone-patched from Houston and Moscow.
 
 At ~5:00am, the three Russian crewmembers downlinked a PAO TV message of greetings and congratulations for the 55<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Baikonur Cosmodrome.  A second message went to Participants and Guests of the 8<sup>th</sup> International Conference of Young Professionals of the Space Rocket, Aviation, Iron and Steel Industries on 6/9 at GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) in Star City. 
 
 At ~3:20pm, all crewmembers are scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H.
 
 The crew completed today’s 2-hr. physical workout protocol on TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
 
 For his T2 exercise session, Soichi Noguchi donned the Glenn treadmill harness with installed transducer instrumentation, then activated the harness.     [Afterwards, FE-5 downloaded the harness data (including achieved “body weight”) and filled out a survey questionnaire to complete the SDTO (Station Development Test Objective).  The harness SDTO uses both TVIS and T2.]
 
 WRM Update:    A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.    [The updated card (23-0003J) lists 128 CWCs (3,109.8 L total) for the five types of water now identified on board: 1. technical water (26 CWCs with 1,066.9 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 545.6 L in 14 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 387.1 L in 9 bags still requiring sample analysis,  2. potable water (9 CWCs with 366.7 L, of which 2 bags with 66.6 L require sample analysis, 4 bags with 170.8 L are to be used with microbial filter &amp; 129.3 L in 3 bags are good for contingency use,  3. iodinated water (84 CWCs with 1,550.1 L, including 27 CWCs with 492.7 L requiring analysis),  4. condensate water (7 bags with 94.8 L, including 2 CWCs with 43.4 L that are to be used with microbial filter, and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (2 CWCs with 31.3 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were Megafan SW Algeria (weather was predicted to be clear over the megafans of southwestern Algeria.  Looking for sinuous, overlapping channels on the land surface - these are the remains of river systems that flowed through the region when the climate was wetter.  Overlapping, nadir-viewing mapping frames taken along track were requested), Mississippi Delta Region (looking to the left of track for the Mississippi Delta.  Detailed overlapping mapping frames of the coastline and inlets were requested to track vegetation health and extent as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill event continues), Wetumpka Impact Crater, AL (weather was clear over this 6.5 km diameter impact structure located to the left of track.  The crater is a fairly subtle feature on the landscape, mainly recognizable from orbit due to the localized radial drainage pattern to the southeast of the town of Wetumpka.  Overlapping mapping frames would be a useful approach for capturing imagery of the crater), Cairo, Egypt (ISS had a nadir-viewing overpass of this famous African capital.  CEO has numerous detailed views of the city, so short lens views of the urban area were requested to provide regional context), and Chiricahua Mountains (the crew had a nadir-viewing pass over this rugged mountain range located in southeastern Arizona.  The mountains are one of the "sky islands" of the Southwestern USA - high elevation regions that preserve flora and fauna that have disappeared from the warmer and drier deserts surrounding them.  Overlapping nadir-viewing mapping frames, taken along track, were requested).
