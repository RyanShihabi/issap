ISS On-Orbit Status 04/26/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
 
Upon wake-up, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator.      [Maxim Suraev installed these filters on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Sasha inspects the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
Before breakfast, FE-3 Garan initiated another round of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol, distributing crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the 26S crew, i.e., Sasha (#1011), Andrey (#1012) &amp; himself (#1013), for a 24 hrs data take.
 
CDR Kondratyev terminated his 12<sup>th</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
In preparation of Progress M-10M/42P (#410) docking on 4/29 (~10:29am EDT), Kondratyev &amp; Samokutyayev worked through the standard 3-hr refresher training for the TORU teleoperator system, which provides a manual backup mode to the Progress’ KURS automated rendezvous radar system.  A tagup with a TORU instructor at TsUP/Moscow via S-band audio supported the training.       [The drill included procedure review, rendezvous, docking data and rendezvous math modeling data review, fly-around, final approach, docking and off-nominal situations (e.g., video or comm loss).  Three different flight conditions were simulated on the RSK1 laptop.  The TORU teleoperator control system lets a SM-based crewmember perform the approach and docking of automated Progress vehicles in case of KURS failure.  During spacecraft approach, TORU is in “hot standby” mode.  Receiving a video image of the approaching ISS, as seen from a Progress-mounted docking television camera (“Klest”), on a color monitor (“Simvol-Ts”, i.e. “symbol center”) which also displays an overlay of rendezvous data from the onboard digital computer, the CDR would steer the Progress to mechanical contact by means of two hand controllers, one for rotation (RUO), the other for translation (RUD), on adjustable armrests.  The controller-generated commands are transmitted from the SM's TORU control panel to the Progress via VHF radio.  In addition to the Simvol-Ts color monitor, range, range rate (approach velocity) and relative angular position data are displayed on the “Klest-M” video monitor (VKU) which starts picking up signals from Progress when it is still approximately 9 km away.  TORU is monitored in real time from TsUP over Russian ground sites (RGS) and via Ku-band from Houston, but its control cannot be taken over from the ground.   On 4/29, Progress KURS-A (active) will be activated at 8:54am EDT on Daily Orbit 1 (DO1), SM KURS-P (passive) two minutes later.  Progress video will be switched on at a range of ~9 km, Progress floodlight at ~8 km.  Progress TORU will activate at 3 km range.  Flyaround to the DC1 nadir port (~400 m range, in sunlight) starts at 10:06:08am, followed by station keeping at 170m at ~10:13am.  Start of final approach: ~10:18am (DO2) in sunlight, contact: ~10:29am.  SM Kurs-P deactivation on mechanical capture.  Sunset: 10:31am.]
 
FE-6 Coleman completed more routine collections for “Exp-27 Week 6” of WRS (Water Recovery System) potable water sampling in the SM (Service Module) for chemical &amp; microbial analysis, using a specific water sample collection packet from stowage.      [Specimens were taken from the SVO-ZV for return on ULF6, and one 500mL sample from the SRV-K Hot tap for microbial post-flight microbial analysis for return on Soyuz 25S.]
 
Afterwards, Cady prepared for and completed the installation of a new amateur/ham radio station in the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory).  Later in the day, Cady checked out the radio’s audio for proper functioning by talking with a ham operator on the ground.      [Activities involved first retrieving all necessary hardware from stowage and setting it up in COL, then installing the VHF Ericsson Transceiver station at the ER3 (EXPRESS Rack 3).] 
 
In Node-2, Ron Garan collected coolant fluid samples from the ITCS MTL (Internal Thermal Control System Moderate Temperature Loop) and LTL (Low Temperature Loop) for return to the ground.  Later, Ron also drew an ITCS coolant sample in the US Lab.
 
Dmitri Kondratyev completed his first preliminary orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test session with the Russian Chibis (“lapwing”) suit by conducting the MedOps MO-4 exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the TVIS treadmill.  FE-1 Samokutyayev assisted as CMO (Crew Medical Officer), and Dima was supported in his one-hour session by ground specialist tagup via VHF at 7:37am EDT.     [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.] 
 
After FE-3 broke out and set up the appropriate equipment, Nespoli &amp; Garan both were subjects of the periodic 30-min US PHS (Periodic Health Status)/Without Blood Labs exam, with Paolo acting as CMO for Ron and Sasha later assisting Paolo as CMO.  FE-3 Garan then logged the data and stowed the equipment.  A subjective evaluation was part of the test.      [The assessment used the AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack), stethoscope, oral disposable thermometer and ABPC (Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff) from the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack).  All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.  The PHS exam is guided by special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.]
 
With STTS comm systems temporarily configured for crew presence in the MRM2 “Poisk” module, Andrey Borisenko conducted another active session for the Russian experiment KPT-10 “Kulonovskiy Kristall” (Coulomb Crystal), followed by downlinking the video footage obtained with a SONY HVR-Z1J camcorder over two RGS (Russian Groundsite) passes (9:00am &amp; 10:30am) and reconfiguring STTS to nominal.     [KPT-10 studies dynamic and structural characteristics of the Coulomb systems formed by charged dispersed diamagnetic macroparticles in the magnetic trap, investigating the following processes onboard the ISS RS: condensed dust media, Coulomb crystals, and formation of Coulomb liquids due to charged macroparticles.  Coulomb systems are structures following Coulomb’s Law, a law of physics describing the electrostatic interaction between electrically charged particles.  It was essential to the development of the theory of electromagnetism.]
 
In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) laboratory, Ron Garan conducted Part 2 of the current new JAXA life science experiment CsPINs (Dynamism of Auxin Efflux Facilitators responsible for Gravity-regulated Growth and Development in Cucumber) by starting Run1-3.     [Steps included preparing CsPINs samples in four Chamber Bs (##801-804) (for cultivating hydrotropism) by watering the samples, then installing the chambers in four MEU B (Measurement Unit B) units and finally attaching these in the CBEF (Cell Biology Experiment Facility) 1G incubator.  The sample now has ~18 hrs for germination, followed by water or salt solution injection, relocating two MEUs to the Micro-G incubator and allowing another approx. 4 hrs of incubation for cultivation.  Finally, the samples will be photographed, put in KFTs (Kennedy Fixation Tubes) for fixation and stowed in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) at +2 degC.   Background: CsPINs studies the phenomenon of tropism, i.e., the growth or turning movement of a biological organism, usually a plant, in response to an environmental stimulus.  Specifically focusing on gravity, the new JAXA experiment investigates how plants sense gravity as an environmental signal and use it for governing their morphology and growth orientation.  CsPINs plays an important role in the regulation of gravity-dependent redistribution of auxin (a class of plant hormones) and thereby controls gravimorphogenesis (peg formation) in cucumber (Cucmis sativus L.) seedlings.  Gravitropism also interferes with hydrotropism in cucumber roots, in which the dynamism of these facilitators may also play a role.  Cucumber seedlings are used to analyze the effect of gravity on the expressions of CsPINs and unravel their contributions to peg formation.  Hydrotropism is differentiated from gravitropism in roots, and the expressions of CsPINs are compared to determine the interacting mechanism between the two tropisms.] 
 
In COL, after connecting the MPPL (Multi Purpose Payload Laptop) 28VDC power cable to the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop and activating EPM &amp; laptop, Paolo Nespoli began Day 1 of his two-day CARD (Long Term Microgravity: Model for Investigating Mechanisms of Heart Disease) activity.     [For the session, Nespoli first set up the PFS (Pulmonary Function System) with PFM/PAM (Pulmonary Function Module/Photoacoustic Analyzer Module) and GDS (Gas Delivery System), which requires a 45-minute warm up of the PFM/PAM prior to use for the CARD rebreathe exercises.  Paolo then donned &amp; activated the HLTA BP (Holter Arterial Blood Pressure) instrument, to run for the next 24-hrs, collecting BP and HR (heart rate) data every hour during the day and every two hours during sleep, then calibrated the PAM for the subsequent rebreathing exercises with mixing bag, and started urine collections.  The CARD protocol included a 24h urine collection on Day 1, a 24h blood pressure monitoring with the HLTA, a blood draw (in the morning of Day 2), and five cardiac output measurements performed with the HRF-2 PFS via re-breathing technique (three double re-breathing sessions with the 4L Re-breathing Bag on Day 1 and two on Day 2).]
 
Afterwards, Paolo switched the COL PWS-1 (Portable Workstation 1) laptop LAN (Local Area Network) cable from SUP2 (Standard Utility Panel 2) J05 outlet (for nominal LAN) to SUP2 J09 (for redundant LAN), then rebooted the PWS-1.
 
FE-5 also terminated charging of the Li-Ion EMU LLB (Extravehicular Mobility Unit Long Life Batteries) and the regeneration of the METOX (Metal Oxide) carbon dioxide removal canisters, all initiated yesterday in the US A/L (Airlock).
 
Afterwards, Paolo performed the weekly health check of the O<sub>2</sub> sensor in CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) #1045, which has exceeded its shelf life.
 
Cady performed regular maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), inspecting and greasing its VIS (Vibration Isolation System) Y- &amp; Z-axes rails &amp; rollers and upper stops.
 
Later, FE-6 had ~2.5 hrs for stowage relocations in preparation for ULF-6, cleaning out the Node-2 Fwd Endcone area by moving 5 CWCs (Contingency Water Containers) and 4 PWRs (Payload Water Reservoirs) to selected locations in PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module), Node-3 &amp; Node-2.
 
Also in preparation for ULF6, FE3 Garan relocated the VSW2 (Video Streaming Workstation 2) from the Lab to Node-2 to provide Shuttle views during ULF6 robotics.
 
FE-2 Borisenko had several hours reserved to continue the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, today cleaning the numerous Group A ventilator fans &amp; grilles in the SM, after photographing all fan screens for ground inspection.
 
Later, using the KPT-2 IVA-6A thermohygrometer, Borisenko took air temperature measurements in the SM at 15 different locations, recording the centigrade values in an uplinked table.
 
Andrey also conducted the regular quarterly maintenance of the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization).  (Done last time: 1/10).      [This requires inspecting the condition of harnesses, belt slats, corner bracket ropes, IRBAs (Isolation Restorative Bungee Assemblies) and gyroscope wire ropes for any damage or defects, lubricating as required plus recording time &amp; date values, and making sure that the display cable and skirt were properly secured afterwards.]
 
FE-1 Samokutyayev set up and operated the Russian BTKh-43 KONSTANTA (#2) biotech payload with Cassettes 1-3, supported by ground specialist tagup.     [BTKh-43, comprising the Recomb-K hybridizer bioreactor plus photo &amp; video equipment with two SPR-1 portable lights, studies potential effects of spaceflight factors and their nature on the activity of a model enzyme relative to a specific substrate (bioreactors are specialized hardware for growing, cells, tissues, and microorganisms).]
 
Later, FE-1 performed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways to see how the ventilation/circulation system is coping with the 6-person crew.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
Sasha also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
The CDR meanwhile conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Other activities completed by Dmitri Kondratyev included –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">The regular transfer of U.S. condensate water from CWCs #1039 &amp; #1072 to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, then filling the designated KOV EDV container   [once filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.  The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Downlinking, via VHF, the OBR-5 (Obrazovanie-5, Education 5) PAO video “Great Beginning” recorded on 4/19 with the Sony HVR-Z7E camcorder #2 and FSS    [total downlink time ~5-6 min.  The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="color:windowtext;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Using the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to perform the monthly standard check on the SM cabin air, testing for Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Formaldehyde    [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, etc.]</li></ul> 
FE-5 Nespoli worked also on the MLT2 (Microgravity Measurement Apparatus / Laptop Terminal 2), changing its communications network settings for a checkout of the LEHX (Layer 2 Ethernet Hub &amp; Multiplexer) device.     [MLT2 had been temporarily configured for communicating with PEHG-J (Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway-Japan) and needed to be restored to its original setting for the checkout.] 
 
Before crew sleep time, FE-3 Garan will be the subject for a PanOptic eye test which requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination, performed by Cady as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) on Ron with an ophthalmoscope.      [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still &amp; video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula &amp; optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.  Prior to the test, Ron sets up the equipment including video camera, and afterwards downloads the data, then disassembles &amp; stows the gear.]
 
Later tonight before “Presleep”, Ron will power on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.     [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
CDR, FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) scheduled, via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Cady at ~9:55am, Sasha at ~12:35pm, Andrey at ~12:55pm, Dmitri at ~1:20pm EDT.
 
FE-3 &amp; FE-5 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Paolo at ~8:00am, Ron at ~10:55am.
 
At ~11:40am, Kondratyev, Borisenko &amp; Samokutyayev supported two Russian PAO TV events downlinking messages of greetings to (1) the participants of the N.E. Bauman Moscow State Technical University (MGTU) Miss Charming Beauty Pageant on 4/28, and (2) to the participants of the “Childhood without Borders” Festival.     [The Beauty Pageant, a traditional annual event at MGTU, is dedicated this year to the first human flight to space; the theme of the competition is “Space Journey” (“…Girls, study well, and fly to join us here at the ISS!”)  -- The International Childhood Without Borders Festival is conducted by the International Union of Children Public Associations “League of Pioneer Organizations – Federation of Children Organizations”.  This 13<sup>th</sup> festival is dedicated to the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Yuri Gagarin’s flight to space.  Childhood Without Borders is an open platform to demonstrate capabilities and potential of children, association of children and adults working with children. Over three thousand children will participate in the final events, followed by an award ceremony for the winners of the events and contests.]
 
At ~2:35pm, Andrey supported an amateur/ham radio session with Faculty and students at the National Engineering University of Lima, Peru.     [Since the establishment of the Lima ham station in 2010, professors and students have already conducted several successful radio sessions with ISS crews.]
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Dakar, Senegal (general views with the shorter lens of this capital city were requested [detailed images have been acquired].  Shooting just right of track), Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis (looking left of track for the twin islands of St. Kitts and Nevis, a Caribbean nation of 51,400.  The capital, Basseterre, lies on the near end of the larger island.  The origin of these unusual names goes back to Christopher Columbus who named a nearby island after St. Christopher [modern Saba, 27 km to the northwest].  This island became confused with the present St. Kitts, which took the name in time.  Nevis is an Anglicization of “Nuestra Senora de las Nieves” –[“Our Lady of the Snows,” perhaps relating to the white clouds often seen on the island peaks]), and West Cuba mangroves (looking left.  General images [as the basis for future more detailed imaging] are requested of the complex pattern of mangroves on the southern, intricate shoreline of Cuba and its islands).
