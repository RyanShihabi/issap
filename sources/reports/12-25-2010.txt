ISS On-Orbit Status 12/25/10
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Crew rest day.
 
Merry Christmas!
 
 
FE-4 Dmitri Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dima will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-1 Alex Kaleri completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
With POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center/Huntsville) closed down over the holiday, CDR Scott Kelly is charged with verifying the health of MELFI -1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1) and MELFI-3 by checking dewar temperatures on their PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop displays.     [MELFI-1 dewars 1, 2, 3, 4 should show -95 degC, -95 degC, -95 degC, +2 degC; MELFI-3 dewars 1,2,3,4 -95 degC, -95 degC, +2 degC, +2 degC.]
 
The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.] 
 
CDR, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Paolo at ~4:50am, Scott at ~9:30am, Cady at ~11:05am EST.
 
OGS Up and running:   Flight controllers successfully activated the Oxygen Generator System yesterday, for the crew’s “breathing pleasure”.  It is planned to run it for approximately 2 days to increase the cabin oxygen content and then deactivate it nominally.
