Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR):  Virts gathered hardware and tools then replaced the Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus (MDCA) Avionics Package on the back of the CIR Optics Bench.  This completes the planned CIR maintenance and readies the facility for continuing the Flame Extinguishment Experiment (FLEX)-2 experiment. 
 Nanoracks Module 27:  Virts utilized the Plate Reader to scan NanoRacks Module-27 samples (3 Microplates) at 24 hour intervals for the fourth of five planned scan sessions. The crew retrieved data for downlink via NanoRacks Platform after every session.  NanoRacks-Module-27 compares the growth rates of microbes isolated from samples collected from ground-based public venues both in the microgravity environment of the ISS and in the lab at UC Davis. This study also characterizes the microbial communities found on surfaces aboard the ISS using culture-independent methods.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) 3005 Return to Service:  Following the replacement of the EMU 3005 Fan Pump Separator (FPS) this week, Wilmore activated and configured the EMU to perform a full checkout. As part of today’s activities, he performed Radio Frequency (RF) communications checks with the ground on both the prime and alternate UHF radios, tested the suit’s fan, and conducted nominal and extended leakage tests at the maximum operating suit pressure. Once complete, he deconfigured and powered down the suit.
SpaceX-5 Dragon On-board Training:  All three USOS Crewmembers conducted proficiency training for Dragon rendezvous and capture. The lesson walks through the steps in the rendezvous procedures and provides representative Robotics Work Station and Portable Computer System screenshots for each step. In addition, the lesson provides an overview of the Dragon commands available to the crew via the Crew Command Panel. SpaceX-5 is scheduled to launch next week.
