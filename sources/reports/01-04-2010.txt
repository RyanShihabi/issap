ISS On-Orbit Status 01/04/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Underway: Week 6 of Increment 22.
 
 At wake-up, FE-6 Creamer performed the fourth urine pH spot test of the Pro K protocol and later in the day logged his diet intact of today.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 Creamer also had Day 2 with the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) Blood &amp; Urine Activities for the first onboard session with the new routine, modified from the past NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, continuing the 24-hr urine collections started yesterday, stowing the samples in the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) and also doing blood sample collection later in the day.     [The operational products for Blood &amp; Urine collections for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads have been revised, based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV capabilities.  Generic blood &amp; urine procedures have been created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
 FE-1 Suraev started his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by FE-1 Suraev on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 CDR Williams set up all PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware, powered it up and then spent several hours performing his first session with the VO<sub>2</sub>Max assessment.  Later, he cleaned &amp; removed all hardware back into stowage.    [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>Max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol comprises a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
 Williams initiated (later terminated) another 5-hr sampling run (the 58<sup>th</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer).  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.    [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  Today’s data will again to be compared with VOA and GSC (Grab Sample Container) measurements.  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 Afterwards, Jeff collected air samples with GSCs (Grab Sample Containers) in the center of the SM (Service Module), Lab and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory).
 
 The CDR also took on the periodic (monthly) deployment of four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.     [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.] 
 
 In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Soichi Noguchi serviced the Dewey’s Forest science payload, which requires periodic watering for the cultivation of its PUs (Plant Units).     [Dewey’s Forest, one of the Japanese educational payloads, is intended to show how gravity controls the laws of nature and influences our ways of thinking. The project is “a catalyst to rediscover our relationship with plants on the ground and the age-old history of our gardens.”]
 
 FE-1 Suraev &amp; FE-4 Kotov joined up for several hours of reviewing and studying flight procedures for the next Russian EVA-24, scheduled on 1/14 (dryrun on 1/12), then went on an EVA equipment gathering tour to prepare their gear.  The activities were supported by ground specialist tagup.    [Planned EVA-24 tasks, estimated to take about 4 hrs, will focus on
MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2) “Poisk” outfitting:
Installation of KURS AFU antenna feeder unit, AR &amp; 2AR KURS antennas and the MRM2 docking target plus docking monitor target, 
Connecting MRM2 KURS AFU to the SM KURS AFU onboard cabling (BKS) which replaces the SM zenith docking assembly KURS AFU, 
Installing an intermodular SM-MRM2 Ethernet cable, additional handrails on MRMs EVA hatches VL1 &amp; VL2, 
Installation of MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation) blankets on MRM2, and 
Removal of the third BIORISK container along with its installation platform.]
 
 Also in preparation for the upcoming Orlan EVA-24, Oleg &amp; Maxim performed a 1-hr session each with the Russian MedOps procedure MO-6 (Hand-Cycle Ergometry) in the SM, assisting each other in turn and being supported by ground specialist tagup.    [Because cosmonauts in early Russian programs have shown noticeable decrease in arm muscle tone, TsUP/IBMP (MCC-Moscow/Institute of Biomedical Problems) physical fitness experts have groundruled the handgrip/arm tolerance test analysis (hand ergometry) as a standard pre-Orlan EVA requirement.  For MO-6, the subject dons the ECG (electrocardiogram) biomed harness, attaches three skin electrodes and plugs the harness into the PKO medical exam panel on the cycle ergometer.  The other crewmember assists.  The exercise itself starts after 10 seconds of complete rest, by manually rotating the cycle's pedals, set at 150 W, backwards until "complete exhaustion".]
 
 Creamer conducted the periodic inspection of PEPS (Portable Emergency Provisions) on board, checking PFEs (Portable Fire Extinguishers, PBAs (Portable Breathing Apparatus), EHTKs (Extension Hose Tee Kits) and QDMA (Quick-Don Mask Assembly) harnesses.    [PFEs: 2 in Node-1, 1 in A/L, 2 in Lab,1 in Node-2, 2 in JPM, 2 in COL.  PBA O<sub>2</sub> Bottles: 1 in Node-1, 2 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in JPM, 2 in COL.  QDMAs: 1 in Node-1, 5 in A/L, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2, 2 in JPM, 2 in COL.  EHTKs: 1 in Node-1, 2 in Lab, 2 in Node-2.] 
 
 FE-5 Noguchi had several hours set aside to work in the Kibo JPM on preparations for the assembly of the SFA (Small Fine Arm) of the JEMRMS (Robotic Manipulator System).    [After conducting a teleconference with SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center/Tsukuba), Noguchi, with Creamer assisting as required, checked on the readiness of the JEM AL (Airlock) for the assembly by opening its inner hatch and extending its slide table into the JPM, then retrieving equipment bags and installing the SAM (SFA Attachment Mechanism) on the slide table.  After also testing the AL capture mechanism by moving it with the SAM from contact position to release position, Soichi pushed the table back in and closed the inner hatch.  To provide a base for the SFA assembly task, he prepared an equipment bag and suitable foam pieces.]
 
 In the U.S. Lab, TJ worked on the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), removing &amp; replacing piping between the Russian-furnished MNR-NS pump separator and DKiV Pre-Treat Dispenser &amp; Water Pump (also called “Dose Pump”), a regularly scheduled part of 180-day preventive maintenance.   [Done last: 7/6/09.]
 
 Williams started another round of EVA METOX (Metal Oxide) canister regeneration in the U.S. A/L (Airlock).     [The METOX canisters, used to absorb CO<sub>2</sub> during U.S. spacewalks, are regenerated by heating them in a bake-out oven in the A/L.]
 
 The CDR performed the monthly inspection of the T2/COLBERT treadmill system and its components.
 
 Later, Jeff also went over the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) and its VIS (Vibration Isolation System) for the periodic maintenance &amp; visual inspection of its rails &amp; rollers, greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails &amp; rollers and also evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.
 
 Max Suraev completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.] 
 
 Kotov, Creamer &amp; Noguchi each had an hour to themselves for general orientation (station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR/VO<sub>2</sub>), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-4).
 
 Later, TJ transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
 No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today.
