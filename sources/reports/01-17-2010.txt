ISS On-Orbit Status 01/17/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sunday – crew rest day.   Ahead: Week 8 of Increment 22.
 
  FE-4 Kotov began the day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by Maxim Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  After breakfast, CDR Williams &amp; FE-5 Noguchi began a new activity with the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  Right after Postsleep, CDR Williams, FE-5 Noguchi &amp; FE-6 Creamer completed another Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  A total of 121 RST runs are assigned to Jeff for the duration of his orbital stay.]
 
  In final close-out activities after the Orlan EVA on 1/14, Maxim &amp; Oleg worked in the DC1 (Docking Compartment) to re-integrate the Progress 35P cargo ship, docked at the nadir port, with the ISS by –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Opening      the hatches and installing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking      &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP)      to rigidize the coupling; </li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Installing the      ventilation/heating air duct, and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Dismantling the docking mechanism (StM,      Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between      the cargo ship and the DC-1 [StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type,      consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone      (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction      to hard dock.  The ASA is      mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB and      DC-1].</li> </ul> 
  Kotov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.
 
  For the two Russian Flight Engineers, it was time again for recharging the Motorola Iridium-9505A satellite phones located in Soyuz TMA-16/20S (at FGB nadir) &amp; Soyuz TMA-17/21S (at SM aft), a monthly routine job and Oleg’s first, Maxim’s fourth time.      [After retrieving them from their location in the spacecraft Descent Modules (BO), the crewmembers initiated the recharge of the lithium-ion batteries, monitoring the process every 10-15 minutes as it took place.  Upon completion, the phones were returned inside their SSSP Iridium kits and stowed back in the BO’s ODF (operational data files) container.  The satphone accompanies returning ISS crews on Soyuz reentry &amp; landing for contingency communications with SAR (Search-and-Rescue) personnel after touchdown (e.g., after an “undershoot” ballistic reentry, as happened during the 15S return).  The Russian-developed procedure for the monthly recharging has been approved jointly by safety officials.  During the procedure, the phone is left in its fire-protective fluoroplastic bag with open flap.  The Iridium 9505A satphone uses the Iridium constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to relay the landed Soyuz capsule's GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates to helicopter-borne recovery crews.  The older Iridium-9505 phones were first put onboard Soyuz in August 2003.  The newer 9505A phone, currently in use, delivers 30 hours of standby time and three hours of talk, up from 20 and two hours, respectively, on the older units.]
 
  The four Flight Engineers had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~7:15am, Maxim at ~9:40am, TJ at ~11:00am, and Soichi at ~6:15am plus at ~3:30pm EST.
 
  The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
