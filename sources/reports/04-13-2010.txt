ISS On-Orbit Status 04/13/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   FD9 (Flight Day 9) of STS-131/19A. Crew sleep shifting in effect – see below.    
 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;Today 40 years ago (4/13/1970), the words “Houston, we’ve had a problem” rang out drily from deep space when Apollo 13, after rupture of an oxygen tank in the Service Module, lost electrical power and the second oxygen tank.  The intrepid crew, James Lovell, John Swigert &amp; Fred Haise turned the Lunar Module into a make-shift lifeboat and safely made it back to Earth.  The Apollo 13 mission, launched on 4/11 &amp; ending on 4/17 with splashdown, became known as a “successful failure” thanks to a tremendous crew and great ground teams.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
 Mission 19A’s EVA-3 was completed successfully by EV1 Rick Mastracchio &amp; EV2 Clayton Anderson in 6h 24m, accomplishing almost all major objectives.  Beginning this morning at 2:14am EDT, the spacewalk ended at 8:38am. Due to a difficulty with bolt tightening during installation of the old ATA (Ammonia Tank Assembly) on the LMC (Lightweight Multipurpose Experiment Support Structure Carrier) in the Shuttle cargo bay, the spacewalkers fell behind on the timeline and could not complete all objectives.   [EV1 &amp; EV2 began their “campout” yesterday around noon (~12:46pm) in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) with hatch closure and depressurization of the Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe. Following the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Mastracchio &amp; Anderson at ~12:46pm, the A/L hatch was closed again by TJ Creamer &amp; Tracy Caldwell-Dyson for EVA preps in 10.2 psi, followed by EMU purge and prebreathe in the EMUs. Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-3 began at 2:14am, about an hour ahead of schedule (3:11am).   The excursion lasted 6h 24m.]
 
 During EVA-2, Mastracchio &amp; Anderson –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Connected fluid lines to the new S1 ATA (Ammonia Tank Assembly),</li><li>Retrieved A/L (Airlock) MMOD (Micrometeoroid/Orbital Debris) shields from ESP-2 (External Stowage Platform) 2, transferring them to the A/L for return,</li><li>Stowed the old ATA (Ammonia Tank Assembly) on the LMC (Lightweight Multipurpose Experiment Support Structure Carrier) in the Shuttle payload bay,</li><li>Installed the FGB (Fixed Grapple Bar) on the new S1 ATA,</li><li>Relocated the second APRF (Articulated Portable Foot Restraint),</li><li>Prepared the Z1 truss area for installation of the SGANT (Space-to-Ground Antenna) during STS-132/ULF4 (i.e., added 2<sup>nd</sup> wire tie, relocated &amp; mated 2 cannon connectors, moved cable bundle from port to starboard side of Z1 zenith), and</li><li>Partially relocated some EVA tools.</li></ul> 
 Objectives that were deferred for another spacewalk or deleted from the original EVA-3 plan for future disposition include:
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>LWAPA (Light Weight Adapter Plate Assembly) retrieval from COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) &amp; stowage in Shuttle cargo bay on LMC (deferred),</li><li>Installing S1 RGFSB (P1 Radiator Grapple Fixture Stowage Beam) (deferred),</li><li>Re-tightening P1 RGFSB bolts (deferred),</li><li>Installing SPDM (Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator) CLPA (Camera Light Pan Tilt Assembly) 1 (deleted),</li><li>Removing &amp; replacing CP-13 ETVCG (Camera Position 13 External Television Camera Group) light fixture (deleted), and</li><li>Releasing S1 FHRC (Flex Hose Rotary Coupler) P-clamps (deferred).</li></ul> 
  Before the EVA, FE-5 Noguchi verified closure of the external protective shutters of the Lab, Kibo and Cupola windows, then inhibited the CUCU (COTS UHF Communications Unit) for the “Dragon” visit.
 
 FE-6 Creamer made sure that the amateur/ham radio equipment was powered down to prevent RF interference with the spacewalkers.
 
  Noguchi set up the RWS (Robotic Workstation) and DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) peripherals with the IPV (International Procedures Viewer) laptop to support SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) ops. 
 
 Soichi also configured the VDS (Video Distribution System) television set-up in Node-2, verifying that the video cap was installed, thus enabling pass-through reception of video from the Discovery with the Orbiter docked in support of SSRMS ops.
 
  During the spacewalk, PLT Jim Dutton &amp; MS3 Steph Wilson, with FE-5 Noguchi monitoring, operated the Canadarm-2 SSRMS, supporting Rick &amp; Clay with transferring the old ATA to the Shuttle payload bay.   [Ground operators later (~10:16am EDT) powered down the MSS (Mobile Service System) with SSRMS at the MPLM return position.] 
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson supported the spacewalkers on their pre-EVA activities as IV (Intravehicular) crewmember, including campout, hygiene break, EMU assistance, hatch closure &amp; leak check. 
 
  During EVA-3, CDR Poindexter &amp; MS2 Metcalf-Lindenburger (ML) provided IV support, with Dex in charge of photo/video activities.
 
  Post-ingress activities by Anderson, Mastracchio, Dutton &amp; Caldwell-Dyson included the usual post-EVA tasks like photographing EMU gloves for inspection, recharging EMUs with water, downloading &amp; downlinking D2XS EVA &amp; glove photographs, recharging REBA batteries, etc.
 
 After wake-up (10:21pm last night), FE-3 Kornienko performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Mikhail again inspected the filters before bedtime (~11:41am), currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 At wake-up, FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued their current week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s fourth, Tracy’s first, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Caldwell-Dyson &amp; Creamer also completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  FE-1 Skvortsov terminated battery charging for the BAR KELVIN KPT-2 payload and started the process on the battery of the TTM-2 experiment.
 
 Later, CDR Kotov &amp; FE-3 Kornienko used the KPT-2 payload for a 2.5-hr session with the Russian BAR experiment (#23/24), taking background environmental parameters in the RS (Russian Segment) in areas sampled on 3/4 by Oleg and found to have high microflora growth indications on the surface of the pressurized shell.  CDR used the the AU-1 Ultrasound Analyzer, UT2-03 Leak Indicator and Iva-6A Thermal Hygrometer to identify potential condensation areas.  Afterwards, data were downloaded to the RSE1 laptop, log tables filled out for OCA downlink and the equipment restowed.      [The Iva-6A, TTM-2 and Kelvin-Video probes took air &amp; dew point temperatures behind the ASU Toilet ceiling and nearby feedthrough plates.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  The payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
 Skvortsov performed the periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), verifying proper function of its recent (3/29) setup by taking readings with the LULIN-5 electronics box.
 
 Working jointly with Misha Kornienko &amp; Alex Skvortsov as a handover activity, Oleg Kotov conducted routine preventive maintenance on the SM (Service Module) Rodnik water storage system, opening and closing the KN water &amp; KV pressurization valves from the Rodnik control panel.    [The procedure of activating each valve twice is intended to keep the valves functional during long-term water storage.],
 
 Kotov &amp; Kornienko used the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to perform the standard check on the SM cabin air, today looking for Carbon Monoxide, Acetic Acid and Nitrous Gases.     [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, etc.],
 
 Soichi Noguchi &amp; Timothy Creamer had another 2 hrs set aside to reconfigure remaining MARES (Muscle Atrophy Resistive Exercise System) hardware for stowage, to reduce the amount of excess hardware and packing foam left on ISS, by organizing the dozens of MARES components in orderly fashion in three stowage bags, aided by uplinked schematics.    [The activity was started yesterday by Steph &amp; TJ.] 
 
 After preparing the new KUBIK 6 incubator for the commissioning of the KUBIK 6 Drawer by installing the centrifuge insert with its e-box (Electronic Box) on 3/23, FE-6 today unpacked the Drawer, installed KUBIK 6 in it and subsequently installed the Drawer in ESA’s EDR (European Drawer Rack) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory).
 
 In Node-3, TJ later sampled the water from the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) via the RIP (Rack Interface Panel) for inflight analysis.
 
 Afterwards, Creamer processed the water samples with the WMK MCD (Water Microbiology Kit / Microbial Capture Devices) for microbial traces, and the CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for inflight coliform indications (Magenta for Positive, Yellow for Negative).   [The activity must be conducted within 6 hrs after water collection.] 
 
 Although the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator is currently down, Kotov &amp; Kornienko completed the periodic transfer of condensate water to an RS EDV container for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis into oxygen &amp; (waste) hydrogen, filling the designated KOV (condensate water) EDV container (#896), today from US CWCs (Collapsible Water Containers, #1083, #1065, #1089).  When filled, the EDV was connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.     [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.  If bubbles are detected in the EDV, they are separated (by centrifugation) into another EDV.  BKO contains five purification columns to rid the condensate of dissolved mineral and organic impurities.  It has a service lifetime of ~450 liters throughput.  The water needs to be purified for proper electrolysis in the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.]
 
 The CDR also performed the functional check of the running the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the docked period.  Afterwards, Kotov copied the data to a USB drive, cleared the archive and downlinked the files.  The hardware was then restarted to continue taking data.     [Data calldown to TsUP/Moscow must be done once a day during joint flight of 19A with the ISS, the file downlink and restart every third day.  IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises.]
 
 Noguchi looked for &amp; located two CWCs, readying one (#1086) to be filled from the Shuttle, and checking the other (#1072) for its fill quantity (found to be ~20% full).
 
 Later, the FE-5 configured the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) for internal use of an EDV-U container.     [The RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) reached its processing limit today but will be replaced only tomorrow.  In case the WSTA (Waste Storage Tank Assembly) becomes full, an EDV-U was readied to replace the currently installed EDV if necessary.]
 
 Continuing the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS ventilation systems, Skvortsov used a vacuum cleaner and soft brush to clean the clean the “Group B” fan screens in the SM.
 
 Kornienko did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Misha also completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 Before start of today’s cargo transfers from MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) Leonardo, TJ transferred the VCA-1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) camcorder from the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to the Node-2, mounting it on the zenith “ceiling” for monitoring cargo transfer activities in the MPLM/Node-2 area.   [Afterwards, Tracy returned it to the COL at the end of the crew day and installed on its seat track at the Port Endcone, aft side.]
 
 Cargo transfers were performed by Oleg, Soichi, Dex, Naoko Yamazaki, Steph Wilson &amp; Dottie “ML” Metcalf-Lindenburger.
 
 Alex, Misha &amp; Tracy again had free time to themselves for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
 CDR, FE-1, FE-2 &amp; FE-3 had their PMCs (Private Medical Conferences), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Oleg at ~11:11am, Misha at ~11:46am, Alex at ~12:31pm, Tracy at ~12:46pm EDT.
 
 The crew completed today’s physical workout regime on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-3, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-3).  
 
 Soichi Noguchi set up the video equipment to cover Oleg Kotov’s workout on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) for subsequent biomechanical evaluation by ground specialists, and later tore it down and stowed it again.
 
 Elektron Failure:   Elektron is currently deactivated.  Troubleshooting has not been successful to date, and TsUP/Energia is weighing the option of either getting the oxygen generator fixed or replacing it with a new unit.  The US OGS (Oxygen Generator System) is available and can be activated when necessary.  O<sub>2</sub> will also be transferred from Discovery, with the quantity to be determined later. 100 lbs of O<sub>2</sub> stack repress is needed to offset the deactivated Elektron. 
 
 S1 NTA GPRV Problems:   Ground teams were unable to open the NTA GPRV (Nitrogen Tank Assembly Gas Pressure Regulating Valve), which has been integrated with the new ATA.  The NTA supplies pressure to the ATA, which in turn feeds the ETCS (External Thermal Control System) Loop A.  Loop A is currently isolated from the ATA and is operating nominally.    [NH<sub>3</sub> (Ammonia) is supplied to the ETCS via the ATA when there are volume changes in the system due to varying thermal conditions.  It is currently being assessed whether the ATA will need additional NH<sub>3</sub> and what work arounds offer themselves, such as adjusting the TRRJ (Thermal Radiator Rotary Joint) angle and/or increasing the heat load on Loop A.]
 
 Transfer Update:   Eight CWC-Is (CWC-Iodine) and 2 CWCs have been filled and transferred to the ISS.  Cargo transfers are ahead of schedule at 89% overall complete, 74% complete in the Middeck, and 95% complete in the MPLM.
