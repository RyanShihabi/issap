<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Yest kasaniya!    At 7:09pm last night, Progress M-14M/46P (#414) docked successfully to the DC1 (Docking Compartment) nadir port under precise automatic Kurs control.     [Kurs antenna retraction was nominal.  Kasaniya (contact) was followed by a final DPO post-contact thrusting burn, docking probe retraction and Sborka (hook closure) after motion damp-out while the ISS was in free drift for 20 min.  At “hooks closed” signal, RS (Russian Segment) MCS returned to active attitude control, maneuvering the ISS to LVLH TEA (local vertical/local horizontal Torque Equilibrium Attitude).  Attitude control authority had been handed over to Russian MCS (Motion Control System); it returned to US Momentum Management later.  Next came the standard 1-hr leak checking, opening of the hatches between DC1 &amp; SU vestibule and SU &amp; Progress and installation of the BZV screw clamps, followed by the standard air sampling inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M air sampler, then powering down the spacecraft and installation of the ventilation/heating air duct, taking photographs of the internal docking surfaces for subsequent downlinking, and dismantling &amp; removing the StM docking mechanism between the cargo ship and the DC1 nadir port.  The craft delivered 2,050 lbs (922.5 kg) of propellant, 110 lbs (50 kg) oxygen and air, 926 lbs (417 kg) of water and 2,778 lbs (1250 kg) of spare parts and experiment hardware for a total of 2.9 tons of food, fuel and equipment to be delivered to the ISS.   Progress 46P is scheduled to remain docked to Pirs until late April.]</li></ul> 
Automated approach &amp; docking was monitored from the SM by FE-1 Shkaplerov &amp; FE-4 Kononenko on the TORU manual teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system in case automated control was aborted.
 
After the cargo ship’s docking, Anton &amp; Oleg shut off the TORU, and reconfigured the STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to normal ops.     [The "Voskhod-M" STTS enables telephone communications between the SM, FGB, DC-1 and USOS, and also with users on the ground over VHF channels selected by an operator at an SM comm panel, via STTS antennas on the SM’s outside.  There are six comm panels in the SM with pushbuttons for accessing any of three audio channels, plus an intercom channel.  Other modes of the STTS include telegraphy (teletype), EVA voice, emergency alarms, Packet/Email, and TORU docking support].
 
The Russian flight engineer then started the standard one-hour leak checking of the docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and the DC1 SU vestibule.
 
Later, Kononenko opened the hatches and installed the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling.
 
Afterwards, Anton powered down the spacecraft and installed the ventilation/heating air duct.
 
This was followed by the standard air sampling inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M air sampler.
 
After wakeup this morning, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
CDR Burbank, FE-5 Kuipers &amp; FE-6 Pettit each completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 21<sup>st</sup> for Dan, the 14<sup>th</sup> for André and Don.  The three crewmembers are performing their RST sleep shift session starting on 1/24 and every day through 2/2.        [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Don ended his ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Ambulatory Monitoring session and doffed the Actiwatch Spectrums and HM2 (Holter Monitor 2).
 
Anatoly Ivanishin took two photos of the internal part of the DC1 nadir port’s SSVP-StM docking cone (folded aside) to obtain digital imagery of the scratch or scuff mark left yesterday by the head of the 46P active docking probe on the internal surface of the passive drogue (docking cone) ring, a standard practice after Russian dockings.  Anatoly subsequently downlinks the pictures via OCA assets.     [These images are used to refine current understanding of docking conditions.  The objective is to take photo imagery of the scratch or scuff marks left by the head of the docking probe on the internal surface of the drogue (docking cone, ASP) ring, now rotated out of the passageway.  Before shooting the picture, the cosmonaut highlights the scuffmark with a marker and writes the date next to it.  As other crewmembers before him, Anatoly used the Nikon D2X digital still camera to take the pictures with the hatch partially closed.]
 
Shkaplerov unloaded and transferred the MBI-29 IMMUNO ((Neuroendocrine &amp; Immune Responses in Humans During &amp; After Long Term Stay at ISS) payload from Progress 46P to the SM with its two Saliva-Immuno kits and 4 KRM Plazma-03 kits. 
 
Kononenko, Kuipers &amp; Pettit jointly worked their way through another periodic CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) Medical Contingency OBT (Onboard Training) drill, taking ~45 min.       [This on-board training/drill gives crewmembers the opportunity to work as a team in resolving a simulated medical emergency onboard ISS. This training refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment use, and procedures.  Objective is to practice crew communications &amp; coordination necessary to perform medical emergency procedures using such equipment as the ACLS, ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack) &amp; AED (Automated External Defibrillator), performing hardware deployment &amp; rescuer positioning, and conducting simulations of CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), deployment &amp; use of the CMRS (Crew Medical Restraint System), reviewing prevention of oxygen “bubble” build-up when using the RSP (Respiratory Support Pack), etc.]
 
The CDR &amp; FE-5 Kuipers filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnairea) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Dan’s 9<sup>th</sup>, Andre’s 4<sup>th</sup>.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
Working on the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System 2) in Node-3, Dan Burbank removed the brine-filled ARFTA #1 (Advanced Recycle Filter Tank Assembly 1), drained it with the Russian Kompressor-M into an EDV-U container and replaced it with ARFTA #2 in WRS-2.     [The recycle tank was then to be filled via the refill method using the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) quick-disconnect depress hose which was later removed again, along with the tank’s vent adapter.] 
 
In the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Pettit removed PCRF (Protein Crystallization Research Facility) cables and then installed the payload canister, delivered on 46P, into the PCRF in Ryutai rack, followed by cable restoration.
 
FE-2 Anatoly Ivanishin performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
The crew worked out with an abbreviated physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-4), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1).
 
DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) + Reboost:    A DAM/reboost burn will be performed tonight at 6:50pm EST using the SM Main thrusters for 1m 4s.  The purpose of the reboost is to avoid a series of conjunctions with Object 30502 (Fengyun 1C Debris), and to set up phasing for the future trajectory events.  This reboost will replace the previously planned reboost on 2/1.
