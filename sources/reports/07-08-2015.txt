Plant Gravity Sensing 2 (PGS2):  After Kelly removed a seed paper kit from a Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) he noted mold on the growth media.  He discontinued the PGS2 activities and reported his observations to ground experts.  This investigation supports the study of cellular formation of the gravity sensors and the molecular mechanism for gravity sensing in plants grown in microgravity conditions.
Capillary Effects of Drinking in the Microgravity Environment (Capillary Beverage):  Kelly drank water from a specially designed Space Cup to demonstrate how a fluid reacts to the cup’s design. High definition video was used to capture images that will be analyzed on the ground.  Since microgravity affects fluid dynamics, in the past crew members have drunk from special sealed bags instead of using straws or normal cups. The Capillary Beverage investigation studies the process of drinking from Space Cups with different design configurations that mimic the gravitational flow of a liquid through capillary forces.
VEG-01 Investigation:  Kelly reviewed on-board training for VEG-01 and installed root mats and plant pillows to initiate the VEG-01 experiment in the Veggie facility. Veggie provides the necessary lighting and nutrient delivery for efficient plant growth in space. The Veg-01 investigation is used to assess on-orbit function and performance of the Veggie facility, focusing on the growth and development of ‘Outredgeous’ Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seedlings in the spaceflight environment.  It is also used to determine the effects of the spaceflight environment on composition of microbial flora on the plants and the Veggie facility.
