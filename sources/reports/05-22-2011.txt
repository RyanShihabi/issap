ISS On-Orbit Status 05/22/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday.    Ahead: Week 10 of Increment 27/28.   FE-3 Ron Garan continues on his special Shuttle-crew sleep schedule for EVA support:  Wake – 9:26pm last night; Sleep – 12:26pm-8:56pm today.  The ISS crew is also sleep-shifting:  Wake – 9:00am; Sleep – 8:01pm (till 6:01am tomorrow for additional rest).
 
Mission ULF-6’s EVA-2 was completed successfully by EV1 Mike Fincke &amp; EV2 Drew Feustel in 8h 7m, accomplishing all objectives.  Beginning this morning at 2:05am EDT, the spacewalk ended at 10:12am.     [EV1 &amp; EV2 began their “campout” yesterday around noon in the U.S. Airlock (A/L) at ~11:51pm with hatch closure and depressurization of the Crewlock (CL) from 14.7 to 10.2 psi, followed by mask prebreathe (~11:51pm-12:56pm) and sleep from 1:26pm-9:26pm.  After wake-up at nighttime and the usual hygiene break/with mask prebreathe for Spanky at 10:01pm-11:11am, the A/L hatch was closed again by Ron Garan &amp; Mark Kelly for EVA preps in 10.2 psi (11:11am-12:41am), followed by EMU purge (12:41am-12:56am) and prebreathe in the EMUs (12:56am-1:46am).  Afterwards, with CL depressurization and EV1/EV2 switching to suit power, EVA-2 began at 2:05am.  The excursion lasted 8h 7m.  It was the 6<sup>th</sup> longest EVA in history, the 116<sup>th</sup> EVA from the US Airlock, and the 157<sup>th</sup> EVA for ISS assembly &amp; maintenance.
 
During EVA-2, Mike &amp; Drew –

Removing the Port SARJ covers took longer than expected, requiring an extension of spacewalk duration by over an hour.  During SARJ cover removal, several bolts came loose from covers 16 &amp; 17 but were captured and stowed in a trash bag, except for at least one bolt (camera-tracked) and 3 washers that were lost overboard.  Cover 17 had only 1 bolt remaining and could not be reinstalled; it was brought back inside.
 
Before today’s spacewalk, CDR Mark Kelly set up the photo equipment for Mike &amp; Drew.     [One of the NIKONs, without flash, failed shortly after egress.  The second camera and the helmet cameras were used for SARJ lube documentation.]
 
After the EVA, activities by Mark, Spanky, Drew, Paolo, Cady &amp; Ron included the usual post-EVA tasks like photographing EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) gloves for inspection, recharging EMUs with water, downloading &amp; downlinking D2XS EVA &amp; glove photographs, recharging EMU and REBA (Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly) batteries, etc.
 
First thing in post-sleep, prior to eating, drinking &amp; brushing teeth, Cady Coleman performed her 4<sup>th</sup> liquid saliva collection of the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol (Day 4), followed by a dry sample collection.  The collections are made every other day for six days.  Later in the day, Cady also completed the IMMUNE blood sample draw, with FE-5 Nespoli assisting as Operator.  Following the blood draw, the full blood tubes were temp stowed in the blood collection kit until tomorrow when they will be packed together with her saliva samples on the Soyuz for return to ground.        [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
FE-6 Coleman also undertook her 23<sup>rd</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for her last night.  This is usually done in Mondays but was pulled a day ahead due to tomorrow’s Soyuz undocking.       [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
In preparation for tomorrow’s undocking, CDR Kondratyev –

The three Russian crewmembers conducted the MO-22 Sanitary-Epidemiological Status check, part of the Russian MedOps program done usually before Soyuz departures.     [To monitor for microflora, Dima, Sasha &amp; Andrey collected samples from surface areas of interior panels and hardware at 24 locations in the SM, FGB, MRM1, MRM2, DC1 and, ATV2, also from himself, using cotton swabs and special test tubes which were then stowed in 25S for return to the ground.]
 
Aleksandr &amp; Paolo retrieved Japanese SS-HDTV (Super Sensitive High Definition Television) kits from Progress 42P and transferred them to the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) for unpacking and subsequent OBT (Onboard Training).

Paolo Nespoli serviced the FCF (Fluids Combustion Facility) in the FIR (Fluids Integrated Rack), changing out the Bio sample on the Bio Base.     [After configuring the US Lab camcorder to cover activities for POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center/Huntsville), Paolo opened the lower &amp; upper FCF doors, rotated the LMM SBA (Light Microscopy Module / Spindle Bracket Assembly) from Operate position to Service position, removed the used sample from the Bio Base, returned it to the Bio kit and installed a new sample from Slot 2 in the kit onto the Base.  He then rotated the LMM SBA back to Operate position and closed the rack doors then turned on two switches and notified POIC that FIR was prepared for ground-commanding the RPC (Remote Power Controller).]

Cady Coleman worked with PLT Box Johnson on the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System) in support of the SPDM lubrication job during the EVA-2.      [SPDM first was released from the Lab, then maneuvered to the LEE lube position and later returned to the Lab.  The SSRMS was then walked off to the MBS PDGF-2 (Mobile Base System Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture 2) where it will remain until late inspection on Flight Day 11.]
 
Cady also collected 17 RAM (Radiation Area Monitor) dosimeters in the ISS and stowed them for return on 25S.
 
Servicing the CGBA-5 Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) with its CSI (Science Insert), Cady deactivated and decabled CGBA-5, accessed CSI-05, performed spider feeding activity, swapped Camera Modules, closed up CGBA, recabled and reactivated it.     [SHAB (Spider Hab) video is monitoring for 24 hours after feeding activity unit.] 
 
At ~11:31am, the traditional PAO-televised “Change of Command” ceremony took place with all crewmembers, officially marking the transfer of the ISS reins from Dmitri Kondratyev to Andrey Borisenko.  Borisenko now commands Expedition 27 and will command Expedition 28.  Dmitri, Cady &amp; Paolo will return to Earth tomorrow in their Soyuz spacecraft.
