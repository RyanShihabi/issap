ISS On-Orbit Status 04/25/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday.   Ahead: Week 6 of Increment 23.
 
  CDR Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the currently running Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  Also at wake-up, FE-2 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson, FE-5 Soichi Noguchi &amp; FE-6 Timothy Creamer undertook another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  After breakfast, Noguchi supported the weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.     [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
  The crew had another busy day setting up the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill at its final place in Node-3 (F5) after yesterday’s relocation from Node 2 (D5).     [FE-1 Skvortsov retrieved &amp; managed parts/components for T2 installation and conducted photo documentation of the install activities in Node-3.  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson and FE-6 Creamer installed the T2 VIS (Vibration Isolation System) and performed documentary photography of the results in its new rack bay in Node-3.  Creamer relabeled the T2 fireport (from “NOD2D5_A1” to “NOD3F5_A1”) and reconfigured the T2 wireless display to connect to the Node-1 WAP (Wireless Access Point).  Two more days are scheduled until nominal full T2 restoration.] 
 
  In support of T2 operational checkout activities ahead, Noguchi relocated the IWIS (Internal Wireless Instrumentation System)’s triaxial accelerometer assembly from its location in the JPM Port endcone to Node-3, installing it on the T2 frame.  Soichi also set up the IWIS RSU (Remote Sensor Unit) in Node-3, for transmitting the structural dynamics/vibrational data measured by the accelerometer.
 
  Additionally, the crew spent several hard-working hours on installing &amp; outfitting the new 19A-delivered CQ (Crew Quarters) as the third permanent sleep station in Node-2 at rack bay location O5.  The other three CQs are two “Kayuta” sleep stations in the SM (Service Module) and one ad hoc CQ in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).    [CQ outfitting today was conducted by CDR Kotov &amp; FE-3 Kornienko, after FE-5 Noguchi had removed the “bumpout” structure, which he later re-installed.  Setting up the CQ rack involved removing launch restraint bolts and transferring the CQ from the launch configuration to the on-orbit crew habitable volume configuration.] 
 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Flight Engineer worked on the ad hoc CQ in the JAXA JPM (loc. D3), rerouting its Node-2 jumpers from Node-2 O5 to D5, then replacing its 9V batteries with fresh ones and conducting a checkout of the CQ.    [The future relocation of the CQ from the JPM to D5 in Node-2 is considered a priority.  Since its jumpers are currently connected to Node-2, they are “hatch drag-throughs” requiring a special waiver, which is set to expire at the end of the 19A stage (5/16).  It will have to be updated to allow for the continued use of the drag-through until the end of the ULF-4 stage (Sept. 2010).]
 
  FE-3 Kornienko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Mikhail also checked up on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP. 
 
 An additional task for Misha in the SM was a routine inspection of the SVO SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor hoses from the MFR Diaphragm Separator Filter to the BRPK Condensate Separation &amp; Pumping Unit (the latter was replaced on 12/21/09).
 
 
  FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson unstowed her pH log for tomorrow’s early morning activities for the medical protocol for Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict &amp; Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her second on board.  Tracy will perform the urine spot test for pH (not sampling) and later log tomorrow’s diet intake on an electronic form.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
  Several time during the day, Tracy &amp; Timothy Creamer checked up, via laptop displays, on the proper functioning of the MELFI-1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1), MELFI-2 &amp; MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) freezers as well as of the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System), as stand-ins for the closed-down POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center).     [MSFC/Huntsville today continues to have a power outage (ending tonight at 12:00am EDT) to perform preventative maintenance, corrective maintenance and system upgrades as needed.]
 
  Working off the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, Kotov, Skvortsov &amp; Kornienko –
