 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Wake:  9:30am – 1:00am (tomorrow)</li></ul> 
 Yest kasaniye!    At 2:32pm EDT, Progress M-05M(37P) docked successfully to the DC-1 port under manual TORU control, followed by a final DPO post-contact thrusting burn, docking probe retraction and hook closure (“sborka”) after motion damp-out while the ISS was in free drift for ~20 min (2:35pm-2:55pm).  At “hooks closed” signal, the SM returned to active attitude control, maneuvering the ISS to LVLH TEA (local vertical/local horizontal Torque Equilibrium Attitude) at ~3:00pm.  Control authority returned to US Momentum Management at ~3:35pm.  Russian thrusters will be disabled temporarily during clamps install and leak check (4:20pm-5:35pm).    [Auto rendezvous mode was aborted at about 2:10pm EDT.]
 
 As part of the crew’s regular morning inspection tour, CDR Kotov conducted the routine checkup of circuit breakers &amp; fuses both in the DC1 (Docking Compartment) and in the MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2).    [The monthly checkup in the “Pirs” and “Poisk” modules looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.]
 
 For monitoring 37P rendezvous &amp; docking, Creamer &amp; Kotov set up the Ku-band video “scheme” for covering the Progress docking, activating the FGB-based A31p SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for the TV conversion to NTSC &amp; Ku-band of the RS (Russian Segment) video signal from the SONY HDV camera via the MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder from FGB &amp; SM, in order to downlink “streaming video” packets via U.S. OpsLAN and Ku-band.
 
 FE-3 Kornienko configured the hardware of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #9 to conduct observations during the Progress approach and linkup, then took down the equipment and stowed it.    [Using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment is designed for spectral observations of the Earth atmosphere and surface, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]
 
 Also before docking, Skvortsov shut down the amateur/ham radio equipment to prevent RF interference with the Progress KURS radio control system.
 
 FE-5 Noguchi meanwhile closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Kibo &amp; Cupola science windows.
 
 Before the docking, Kotov switched the KRIOGEM-03M container to +4 degC and the TBU thermostat-controlled incubator to +29 degC.
 
 After the cargo ship’s successful docking, Oleg Kotov, Alexander Skvortsov &amp; Mikhail Kornienko shut off the TORU teleoperated rendezvous &amp; docking system, used as manual standby, and reconfigured the STTS telephone/telegraph subsystem to normal ops.   [The "Voskhod-M" STTS enables telephone communications between the SM, FGB, DC-1 and USOS, and also with users on the ground over VHF channels selected by an operator at an SM comm panel, via STTS antennas on the SM’s outside.  There are six comm panels in the SM with pushbuttons for accessing any of three audio channels, plus an intercom channel.  Other modes of the STTS include telegraphy (teletype), EVA voice, emergency alarms, Packet/Email, and TORU docking support].
 
 The crewmembers then conducted the standard one-hour leak checking of the docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and DC-1 compartment.
 
 Later today, the Russian crewmembers will –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Open the hatches (~5:35pm) and install the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) to rigidize the coupling; </li><li>Perform the standard air sampling inside Progress with the Russian AK-1M air sampler; </li><li>Power down the spacecraft and installing the ventilation/heating air duct; </li><li>Take photographs of the internal docking surfaces for subsequent downlinking,</li><li>Dismantle the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC-1 (~7:15pm-8:15pm)  [the StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB and DC-1], and</li> </ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Transfer six Russian high priority biotechnology payloads to the ISS, setting them up in the RS (Russian Segment) and taking documentary photography of each:  </li> </ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 54pt; "> <li>BTKh-5/LAKTOLEN (to Bioecology containers in SM), </li><li>BTKh-6/ ARIL (to the TBU thermostat-controlled incubator at +29 degC) </li><li>BTKh-7/OChB, </li><li>BTKh-26/KASKAD (Cascade), (to KRIOGEM-03M at +4 degC)</li><li>BTKh-40/BIF (to MRM2, then to TBU), and </li><li>BTKh-41/BACTERIOFAG (Bakteriophag, to container and TBU)).</li> </ul> 
 Kotov then has ~1 hr reserved on his timeline for the first cargo transfers from the Progress to the ISS.
 
 On the US side, FE-6 Creamer will disassemble &amp; remove the RS video “scheme”.    [The associated conversion laptop, an A31p (SSC-1) in the FGB, on which Oleg monitored the video stream during the relocation, was configured and later shut down by TJ.]
 
 At wake-up, CDR Kotov performed the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the currently running Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [CDR again inspected the filters before bedtime, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-3 Kornienko terminated the periodic regeneration of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, closing down the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.     [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days. (Last time done: 3/15-3/16/10).]
 
 As part of the crew’s regular morning inspection tour, Skvortsov conducted the routine checkup of circuit breakers &amp; fuses both in the DC1 (Docking Compartment) and in the MRM2 (Mini Research Module 2).    [The monthly checkup in the “Pirs” and “Poisk” modules looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.]
 
 Also at wake-up, FE-6 Creamer continued his current medical protocol of Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), his 4<sup>th</sup> onboard run, performing the urine pH spot test (not sampling) and later logging his dietary intake.    [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 5 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
 Later, Timothy set up the Nutrition/Repository/Pro K equipment for the 24-hour urine collections of his Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood &amp; urine procedures were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
 With the Russian crewmembers fully occupied with docking &amp; post-docking tasks, FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson, FE-5 Noguchi &amp; FE-6 Creamer spent three hours on the weekly task of thorough station cleaning, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
 In Node-2, Tracy shut down the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) equipment and removed it to stowage, notifying POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) of the 
 deactivation.    [160 Education Groups participated in collecting images for the week.  Over 900 images are on the ground with more expected by payload shutdown.]
 
 Creamer performed repair on the ABRS (Advanced Biological Research System) which had a sheared water reservoir QD (quick disconnect) line (#2).    [With the humidity control system of the ERC (Environmental Research Chamber 2) turned off, TJ removed tubing with QD from WWB (Waste Water Bag), cut the tubing just inboard of the reducer, removed clamps from reducer, and installed new tubing with QD for Line 2, then took photographs of the repaired line.] 
 
 Caldwell-Dyson performed her first session with the MedOps experiment WinSCAT (Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows), logging in on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop and going through the psychological evaluation exercise on the PC-based WinSCAT application.      [WinSCAT is a monthly time-constrained questionnaire test of cognitive abilities, routinely performed by astronauts aboard the ISS every 30 days before or after the PHS (periodic health status) test or on special CDR's, crewmembers or flight surgeons request.  The test uses cognitive subtests that measure sustained concentration, verbal working memory, attention, short-term memory, spatial processing, and math skills. The five cognitive subtests are Coding Memory - Learning, Continuous Processing Task (CPT), Match to Sample, Mathematics, and Coding Delayed Recall.  These WinSCAT subtests are the same as those used during NASA’s long-duration bed rest studies.]
 
 Tracy also filled out her weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC.     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 As a VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activity, on his free time, Soichi had taken on an installment of the JAXA EPO (Educational Payload Operation) program “Try Zero-G”, for which prepared the HD TV gear (high definition G1 camcorder, MPC/Multipurpose Converter, IPU/Image Processing Unit) for recording the third session with the JAXA “Try Zero-G” experiment, and then conducted the demo, showing examples of the difference between 0G and 1G.    [The video had to be downlinked to SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center)/Tsukuba via high-rate data link.]
 
 Oleg did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 FE-2, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Tracy at ~8:00am, Soichi at ~9:45am, TJ later tonight at ~11:00m EDT.
 
 The crew completed their physical workout protocol (reduced for Sasha, Oleg &amp; Misha) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-5), TVIS treadmill (FE-3). ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-2, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).    CHECK THIS – CAN T2 BE USED AGAIN?
