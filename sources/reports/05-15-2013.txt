New Status: 
Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS): Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy set up and completed the ninth of thirteen sessions planned for this experiment. BASS examines the burning and extinguishing characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity and will guide strategies for extinguishing fires in microgravity. BASS results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth.

Ultrasound Background Noise Test (UBNT): Cassidy downlinked data from the Remote Sensor Units (RSUs) for ground specialists to review.  The Ultrasonic Background Noise Test (UBNT) detects high-frequency sounds generated by hardware on the U.S.-built portions of the International Space Station. Identifying sources of noise will aid in development of a leak locating system, which would detect the high-pitched sound of air leaking through a pressurized wall. To detect leaks, the system would have to tell the difference between harmless background sounds and potentially dangerous air leakage.

Russian Crew Off-Duty Day: Today is an off duty day for Commander (CDR) Vinogradov and FE-2 Misurkin, as compensation for the support they provided for the 33S undocking on Monday.
Ammonia Response Procedure Deploy and On-Board Training (OBT): Cassidy deployed the updated ammonia procedures flown on 51P. Following the deployment, all three crewmembers (Vinogradov, Misurkin, and Cassidy) reviewed the procedures and deployment locations to be prepared in the event of an ammonia leak inside the station.
Previous Status (05/13/10):
Change of Command:  On Sunday, off-going ISS Commander (CDR) Chris Hadfield handed ISS command responsibilities over to CDR Pavel Vinogradov, making the 34 Soyuz (S) crew the prime crew in the event of an ISS emergency.
33 Soyuz (S) Cargo Return and Undock Preparations: FE-6 Marshburn collected and packed Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) area dosimeters for return on 33S. The EMU gloves and communication cap that were used on Saturday for the USOS EVA were also packed for return, as well as the late load items.  The 33S crew (Hadfield, Romanenko and Marshburn) completed preparations for undock.

33S Landing:  Soyuz 33S (TMA-07M, #704A) undocked from the International Space Station (ISS), Russian Segment (RS) Multi-purpose Research Module 1 (MRM1) Nadir docking port at GMT 133/23:07:54 (5:07 pm CDT).  Prior to the undocking, the crew performed leaks checks of the vestibule area between the MRM1 docking port and the Soyuz vehicle, suit leak checks and a leak check of the hatch between the descent module and the habitation module.  The undock command, which initiates the opening of the Soyuz vehicle docking hooks, was issued at GMT 133/23:05:00 (6:05 pm CDT).  Three minutes after the separation a fifteen second separation burn was performed.  The de-orbit burn was initiated at approximately GMT 134/01:37:11 (8:37 pm CDT) and was completed at approximately GMT 134/01:41:56 (8:41 pm CDT) and resulted in an approximately 128 m/sec deceleration.  Module separation occurred at approximately GMT 134/02:05:30 (9:05 pm CDT) followed by atmospheric entry at approximately GMT 134/02:08 (9:02 pm CDT).  Parachute deployment was scheduled to occur at approximately GMT 134/02:16:20 (9:16 pm CDT).  The Soyuz 33S vehicle landed at approximately GMT 134/02:30:52 (9:30 pm CDT) in the nominal (pre-planned) landing zone.  The vehicles final landing position was in the horizontal position.
