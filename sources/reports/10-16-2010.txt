ISS On-Orbit Status 10/16/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – crew rest day.
 
 After wakeup, CDR Wheelock, FE-6 Walker &amp; FE-3 Kelly continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 6<sup>th</sup> for Wheels &amp; Shannon, 1<sup>st</sup> for Scott, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 The six station residents completed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).     ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
 As part of the uborka house cleaning, the Russian crewmembers conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) and Group E fan grills in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP).
 
 At ~7:45am EDT, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
 Fyodor Yurchikhin completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Shannon Walker retrieved &amp; stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies, deployed by her on 10/14 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.    [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
 Doug Wheelock &amp; Scott Kelly filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).     [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
 After an N<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen) repress of the cabin air from Progress 37P yesterday, an O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) repress from 37P tankage took place today.    [These represses are needed before dismantling an O<sub>2</sub> regulator.  The regulator is the same as on 22S &amp; 24S, and on 10/14 the crew reported that they had access to the regulator and may be able to return it on 23S.  20kg of O<sub>2</sub> available (~16mmHg of stack pressure) are to be used in two represses over two days.  The regulator on 24S had issues prior to launch, however after several cycle sessions, the valve/regulator seemed to work.]
 
 Walker continued reconstitution work on Makita batteries for EVA tools (e.g., PGT/Power Grip Tools), discharging/recharging each battery.    [Each Makita discharge takes ~25 min, followed by a cool down period of 1h minimum and recharge, which takes 1h25m.]
 
 Shannon also performed the regular camera setup status check on the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) with Sample 7, done one, three and five days after initializing, plus today taking photos of the position of the flash and the sample module in all three axes.
 
 At ~6:30am, Alex, Oleg &amp; Fyodor engaged in a PAO phone interview via S-band with Ekaterina Beloglazova, Editor of Rossiyskiy Kosmos Magazine and an old friend of ISS cosmonauts.     
 
 At 3:55pm the three Russian flight engineers are also scheduled for three PAO events, downlinking messages of greetings and congratulations to the “Good Evening, Moscow!” TV Program, the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the All-Russian Voluntary Firefighting Association, and the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of MCC/TsUP-Moscow.
 
 CDR &amp; FE-3 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Scott at ~11:50am, Wheels at ~2:20pm. 
 
 At ~1:05pm, Doug will power up the SM (Service Module)'s amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and conducted, at 1:10pm a ham radio session with students at George Observatory, Needville, TX.     [October 16, 2010 is designated as Astronomy Day at George Observatory, located in Fort Bend County, Texas, near Houston.  The event is sponsored by various astronomy clubs and the Houston Museum of Natural Science. There will be plenty of activities designed to educate children, and peak their interest in astronomy and science. The children interviewing the ISS crew are Boy Scouts and youth members of several astronomy clubs. In the evening the children will learn how to track the ISS across the night sky, will be able to look through the three telescopes at the observatory, and will be given "sky tours" with the aid of green laser pointers.]
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
