ISS On-Orbit Status 12/19/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Soyuz TMA-07M/33S launched this morning on time at 7:12:12am EST from the Baikonur Cosmodrome (5:51:11pm local), with Roman Romanenko (Roskosmos/Russia), Dr. (med.) Tom Marshburn (NASA/USA) &amp; Chris Hadfield CSA/Canada.  Docking at the MRM1 Rassvet module will be on Thursday, 12/21, at ~9:13am EST.   &gt;&gt;&gt;This is the 130<sup>th</sup> mission to the ISS.  With the first launch of the FGB “Zarya” module on a Proton-K (1A/R) on 11/20/1998, there have been a total of 37 US/Shuttle missions, 85 Russian missions (1 failed), 3 European missions (ATV-1, ATV-2, ATV-3), 3 Japanese missions (HTV1, HTV2, HTV3) and 2 commercial missions (SpX-D, SpX-1).  It is also the 6<sup>th</sup> post-Shuttle manned launch.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
After wakeup, FE-2 Tarelkin rebooted the Russian RSS1 &amp; RSS2 laptops and completed daily routine maintenance on the BRI smart switch router (SSR), checking its temperature via DeviceControl on the RSS1 laptop to ensure nominal operation.     [The BRI fan module consists of 4 individual fans. If one or several of these exhibit malfunction or rotation speed decreases, a combined warning is sent to the DeviceControl application on the RSS1 laptop to generate an emergency message and telemetry signal, “BRI1”. The fan module is an ORU (On-orbit Replaceable Unit).]
 
FE-1 Novitskiy performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection and also completed the daily reboot of the Russian RS1 &amp; RS2 laptops.
 
Next, Evgeny completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP (Harmful Impurities Removal System) by starting the "bake-out" cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #1 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  The process will be terminated at ~4:15pm EST.  Bed #2 regeneration will be done tomorrow.       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods.  The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days (last time: 11/29 &amp; 11/30.]
 
CDR Ford, Novitskiy &amp; Tarelkin donned their intravehicular Sokol pressure suits and performed a standard fit-check in their body-contoured Kazbek-U couches in the TMA-06M/32S spacecraft, docked at MRM2 Poisk, a 30-min job.      [This required them to get in their shock-absorbing seats and use a ruler to measure the gap between the top of the head and the top edge of the structure facing the head.  The results were to be reported to TsUP.  Kazbek-U couches are designed to withstand g-loads during launch and orbital insertion as well as during reentry and brake-rocket-assisted landing.  Each seat has two positions: cocked (armed) and non-cocked. In the cocked position, they are raised to allow the shock absorbers to function during touchdown.  The fit check assures that the crewmember whose body gains in length during longer-term stay in zero-G, will still be adequately protected by the seat liners for their touchdown in Kazakhstan.  32S return is scheduled for 3/15/13.]
 
Assisted by Tarelkin, Novitskiy conducted a session with the Russian biomed assessment MO-14 (Assessment of Orthostatic Endurance w/o LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) which examines the orthostatic stability of the crewmember’s cardiovascular system at rest using complex methods.       [The session was conducted at rest without the Chibis-M ODNT/LBNP and Holter BP (blood pressure) devices, using only the KARDIOMED (Cardiomed) complex, to test its telemetry downlink at an RGS (Russian Groundsite) overflight at ~6:02am.]
 
Kevin Ford performed regular maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), inspecting and greasing its VIS (Vibration Isolation System) Y- &amp; Z-axes rails &amp; rollers and upper stops.    
 
Kevin also checked the torque of the four ARED Arm bolts, tightening them as needed.
 
Later, the CDR –
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Swapped SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops in the Lab between Deck and Overhead CQ (Crew Quarter) and also swapped a primary hard drive with an un-used hard drive in the UltraBay to prepare for reload    [SSC14, in the Deck CQ, was converted to wireless and then swapped with SSC19 (in Overhead CQ); SSC19 was then connected to Ethernet, with Wireless verified OFF. It was then powered down and its internal Hard Drive was exchanged with the UltraBay Hard Drive in SSC18 (located in Node-3)];
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Reloaded SSC19 with software from the LIS (Load Image Server);
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Set up the SSCs for crew use, SSC19 in Node-2 Deck CQ and SSC20 in Node-2 Stbd CQ (installing T61p USB 120GB Hard Drive and T61p USB HDD data cable on both, later reporting the IDs of the PCs, 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Deactivated the amateur/ham radio system in the SM in preparation for the 33S docking tomorrow;
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Removed the USB jump drive in the ISSAC (ISS Agricultural Camera) laptop and performed a power cycle (on/off) of the laptop and ISSAC PDC (Power/Data Controller),
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Serviced the MERLIN (Microgravity Experiment Research Locker Incubator) freezer #1, removing the old desiccant packs from MERLIN-1 and left the front door open for a 24-hr dryout.      [MERLIN is used for cold storage of crew food and drink. Regular service with desiccants is required to prevent moisture accumulation],
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Worked ~3 hrs in the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) swapping cargoes by retrieving CWC-Is (Contingency Water Container – Iodine) for reprocessing and bacteria filter spares for installation;  [and restowing unexpired CWC-Is] and
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Completed the standard 30-day inspection of the AED (Automated External Defibrillator) in the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) rack;  [AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient.  It then can treat them through defibrillation, i.e., the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm].
 
FE-2 had 1h20m scheduled for IMS-tracked transfers &amp; loading of excessed Russian &amp; US equipment and trash on Progress 48P for disposal (incineration during atmospheric entry).
 
FE-1 spent ~1h05m unloading Progress 49P and transferring Russian &amp; US cargo to the ISS for stowage.
 
Later, Evgeny configured the hardware for the Russian earth observation experiment TEKh-52 “Vizir” (Viewfinder) for another data take at SM window #6 and activated it for a recording run, followed by data downlink via RSPI high-speed data link and ground specialist tagup.       [For today’s tests, Tarelkin used easily identifiable earth targets for obtaining images which will then be processed by the ground for equipment alignment and precision characterization. Vizir uses the new SKPF-U hardware, a photo image coordinate reference system using ultrasound sensors, a NIKON D3X photo camera with AF300-800mm lens with PI emission platform for general target views, and the RSK1 T61p laptop with new software (Vers. 3.4), installed on 8/13.]
 
Oleg completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
FE-1 also performed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, working from the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Before Presleep (~2:30pm EST), Ford powers up the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Kevin turns MPC routing off again.    [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The three crewmembers worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-2).
 
Before his and Oleg’s workout on the ARED, Kevin Ford set up and checked out the G1 video camera for it to record his session on the machine, meeting the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status. Afterwards, Kevin stowed the video footage.
