ISS On-Orbit Status 10/17/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday – Crew rest day.   Ahead: Week 4 of Increment 25
 
 At wakeup (2:00am EDT), CDR Wheelock, FE-6 Walker &amp; FE-3 Kelly continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 6<sup>th</sup> for Wheels &amp; Shannon, 1<sup>st</sup> for Scott, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLEEP session, crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 FE-1 Kaleri performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Alex’s servicing activities included the periodic (weekly)  checkup of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
 CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Fyodor at ~6:00am, Oleg at ~8:30am, Scott at ~1:15pm, Shannon at ~3:20pm, Wheels at ~4:25pm EDT.
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 Jobs listed for Kaleri &amp; Yurchikhin today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for general views of the Andes mountains and their natural environments, and for Patagonian Glaciers,</li><li>A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, </li><li>A ~15-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining NIKON D3 photos with Nikkor 80-200 mm lens and the SONY HD video camcorder on oceanic color bloom patterns in the waters of South-Eastern Pacific., then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,</li> </ul> 
 Conjunction Alert:    Flight controllers are tracking a conjunction with Object #33457, a Chinese CZ-4B rocket body.  The TCA (Time of Closest Approach) is Tuesday (10/19) at 11:01am EDT.  Total miss distance: 1.9 km.  Radial miss: 0.17km.  A valid PC (Probability of Collision) number is not yet available.
