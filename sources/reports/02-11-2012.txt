ISS On-Orbit Status 02/11/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew off duty.
 
After wakeup this morning (~1:00am EST), FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
CDR Burbank completed another post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol, the 28<sup>th</sup> for him.         [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-6 Pettit serviced the running BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6) by replacing the BCAT-6 battery early in the morning with a fresh one and repeating the replacement about 8 hrs later.       [The NIKON D2Xs with EarthKAM software running on an SSC laptop takes automated flash photography controlled by the software, photographing Sample 4 once every two hours for seven days.  Crew performs three camera battery changes and a camera check each day. The camera battery changes are scheduled to be performed approximately every 8 hours per Mike Fossum’s recommendation during past BCAT-6 activities.]
 
CDR Burbank, FE-1 Shkaplerov, FE-2 Ivanishin, FE-4 Kononenko, FE-5 Kuipers &amp; FE-6 Pettit joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, Anton, Anatoly &amp; Oleg completed regular weekly maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the Potok Air Purification System pre-filters in SM &amp; FGB.
 
Dan conducted the regular (~weekly) inspection &amp; maintenance, as required, of the CGBA-4 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4) and CGBA-5 payloads in their ERs (EXPRESS Racks) at Lab O2 &amp; O1, focusing on cleaning the muffler air intakes.
 
Don Pettit started the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) to downlink playback video from the recent for FE5 &amp; FE6 Treadmill Kinematics and Amine Swingbed activities.  POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center)/Huntsville routed the on-board HRDL system.  About 8 hrs later, Don turned MPC routing off again.
 
Anatoly Ivanishin completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV containers on RP flow regulator.]
 
Dan filled out his weekly FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), his 11<sup>th</sup>.       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
The CDR had another time slot reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC (Station Support Computer).     [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
In Node-3, Pettit performed troubleshooting on the PT (Pretreat Tank) of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), to determine the cause for a “Pretreat Bad Quality” indication.     [On 2/6, the PT had been replaced with a spare.]
 
At ~7:35am EST, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
FE-1, FE-4, FE-5 &amp; FE-6 conducted their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~5:30am, Anton at ~9:05am, André at ~10:25am, Don at ~12:00pm EST.
 
At ~5:20am, Burbank powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at 5:30am conducted a ham radio session with students at Soumuta Elementary School, Kagoshima, Japan.
 
At ~11:35am, Shkaplerov, Ivanishin &amp; Kononenko supported a Russian PAO TV session, downlinking messages of greetings to the Russian Veterans of Foreign Wars.      [On 2/15 (Russia’s Memorial Day), the VII<sup>th</sup> Moscow International Festival “Russia’s Soldiers” dedicated to the memory of those Russians who performed their duty abroad, will open in Moscow Central Museum of the Great Patriotic War on Poklonnaya Hill.  Veterans of the Great Patriotic War and military operations are invited to this festival.  An exhibition dedicated to the veterans of foreign wars will take place on the same day.]
 
At ~1:15pm, the Russian crewmembers also joined for downlinking their answers to the questions asked by competitors in the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of the international “Ask A Cosmonaut” program conducted by the International Association of Space Activity Participants and GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center).      [“Dear comrades cosmonauts! I have one question for you. If the six of you are flying together for half a year and then all of a sudden have a quarrel, how can you make peace then? Who is helping you? I wish you never have a quarrel! Thank you for your attention.”; “Since flight duration is increasing, do you consider sending married couples to space? What you think as how it can impact overall psychological climate of the crew and cosmonaut work ability?”; “How long does post-flight rehabilitation last? How often are you allowed to fly to space? Does your body have the same reaction for each flight? Is it possible to get used to the flight in space and g-loads?”; “My classmates and I are proud of you and want to be like you! Please answer this question: What was the most memorable event for you in space? What was the most beautiful place on Earth when you were looking at it from space?”; “What do the cosmonauts do day in and day out in such a small vehicle in huge space? Do you feel like going out? What do you don for a spacewalk between stars?”; “What is the most beautiful phenomenon in space which alone is worthwhile visiting space?”; “How does time fly in space? Does it feel like a dream? What is the speed of a human thought in space?”.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).

WRM Update:     A new WRM (Water Recovery Management) “cue card” was uplinked to the crew for their reference, updated with their latest CWC (Contingency Water Container) water audit.      [The new card (29-0008J) lists 23 CWCs (375.4 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (4 CWCs with 154.8 L, for Elektron electrolysis, all containing Wautersia bacteria, plus 1 empty bag;  2. Condensate water (2 CWCs with 9.8 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (6 CWCs with 79.9 L; also 6 expired bags with 104.3 L);  4. Waste water (1 bag with 6.4 L EMU waste water); and  5. Special fluid (1 CWC with 20.2 L, hose/pump flush).  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
