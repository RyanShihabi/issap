New Status: 
Fundoscope Activation, Checkout and Eye Exam:  Flight Engineer (FE)-3 Cassidy checked out the new Fundoscope hardware used in the Prospective Observational Study of Ocular Health. Following this activity,  he performed an eye exam using the fundoscope with assistance of a physician on the ground.  Ocular Health’s protocol gathers physiological data to characterize the risk of microgravity induced visual impairment intracranial pressure on crewmembers. The data collected will be shared with crew physicians to more accurately assess changes that occur in the visual, vascular, and central nervous systems upon exposure to microgravity and the resulting fluid shifts.
ISS Emergency Drill:  CDR Vinogradov, FE-2 Misurkin, Cassidy and ground controllers worked together to practice their initial response to a simulated ammonia leak. The teams used recently approved procedures and techniques to respond to the simulated leak.  

Russian Treadmill (БД-2) Outfitting:  Vinogradov and Misurkin removed the БД-2 from the Progress and started assembling the unit. The vibration isolation system has been unpacked and assembled.  The crew has begun to assemble the belt unit and will continue with outfitting on Wednesday.

Vane Gap 1 (VG-1) Hardware Setup:  Cassidy configured the Capillary Flow Experiment (CFE)-2 hardware that will be used Wednesday to perform the Vane Gap 1 (VG-1) experiment. The primary objective of the Vane Gap experiment is to determine equilibrium interface configurations and critical wetting conditions for interfaces between interior corners separated by a gap.
