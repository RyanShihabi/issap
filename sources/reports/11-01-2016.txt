Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Maintenance:  The crew performed a half water dump and fill on EMU 3006 feedwater tanks and a full water dump and refill of EMUs 3003 and 3010 feeedwater tanks. These activities satisfy maintenance requirements for on-orbit stowage of the EMUs. 
Urine Processing Assembly (UPA):  Last week, the crew demated the connection between the Fluid Control and Pump Assembly (FCPA) at Quick Disconnect (QD) 27 on the Pressure Control and Pump Assembly (PCPA) and performed a PCPA Remove & Replace (R&R). Today the crew re-mated QD27 to the new PCPA. Re-mating QD 27 will allow the FCPA pressure to be pumped down to a functional range and the Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery (FDIR) limit for the pressure sensor will be re-set to its nominal value post re-mate.
Oxygen Generation Assembly (OGA) Hydrogen (H2) On-Orbit Replacement Unit (ORU) Cell #1:  Over the last few days, system experts discovered that Cell #1 voltage drop is becoming more severe than what was noticed previously. Per engineering team recommendation and Program concurrence, on Saturday the OGA was shut down due to OGA contamination and Cell #1 degradation. The team will further investigate whether to continue operating OGA with degraded Cell #1 or replace it with a suspect on-orbit H2 ORU.
Cygnus Cargo Operations:  Today, the crew performed 30 minutes of Cygnus Cargo Operations from the Task List.  With this time, the crew has completed 10 hours of Cygnus Cargo Operations. Ground teams estimate 19 hours of Cygnus cargo operations remain.
