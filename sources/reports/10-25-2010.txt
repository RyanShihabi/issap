ISS On-Orbit Status 10/25/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway: Week 5 of Increment 25.
 
 Progress M-05M/37P undocked successfully from the DC1 (Docking Compartment) nadir port on time at 10:22am EDT.  37P will free-fly for approximately 3 weeks on autonomous mission and is scheduled to re-enter destructively on or about 11/15.    [Earlier, Doug Wheelock closed the protective shutters of the Lab, Kibo &amp; Cupola windows.  Shannon Walker turned off the amateur/ham radio equipment.  Kaleri &amp; Skripochka monitored the undocking with photo &amp; video cameras, focusing in particular on the Progress docking mechanism to verify that there were no missing or damaged O-ring seals on the docking interface.  FE-5 later switched the DC1-to-Soyuz PEV (Pressure Equalization Valve, Russian: KVD) manually to its Closed position, a standard post-undocking procedure, and downlinked the pictures.]
 
 At wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Fyodor again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 FE-1 Kaleri’s morning inspection today included the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
 Also before breakfast, CDR Wheelock began another round of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol.  In Part 1, Wheels deployed crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit), carried by the Soyuz 23S crew, i.e., Yurchikhin, Walker &amp; himself, for 24 hours (with a microphone on the shirt collar).     [Tomorrow, in Part 2, Doug will deploy the three dosimeters at selected locations for static measurements, and in Part 3, on Wednesday, the dosimeter data will be downloaded and the instruments stowed.  Acoustic data must be taken twice per Increment, each time for the duration of the 16-hour crew workday.]
 
 After breakfast, FE-3 Kelly started his 2<sup>nd</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.   His overnight fast started last night.      [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
 In preparation for Progress M-08M/40P docking next Friday, Alexander Kaleri &amp; Oleg Skripochka went through the standard 3-hr refresher training for the TORU teleoperator system, which provides a manual backup mode to the Progress’ KURS automated rendezvous radar system.  A tagup with a TORU instructor at TsUP/Moscow via S-band audio supported the training.       [The drill included procedure review, rendezvous, docking data and rendezvous math modeling data review, fly-around, final approach, docking and off-nominal situations (e.g., video or comm loss).  Three different flight conditions were simulated on the RSK1 laptop.  The TORU teleoperator control system lets a SM-based crewmember perform the approach and docking of automated Progress vehicles in case of KURS failure.  During spacecraft approach, TORU is in “hot standby” mode.  Receiving a video image of the approaching ISS, as seen from a Progress-mounted docking television camera (“Klest”), on a color monitor (“Simvol-Ts”, i.e. “symbol center”) which also displays an overlay of rendezvous data from the onboard digital computer, the CDR would steer the Progress to mechanical contact by means of two hand controllers, one for rotation (RUO), the other for translation (RUD), on adjustable armrests.  The controller-generated commands are transmitted from the SM's TORU control panel to the Progress via VHF radio.  In addition to the Simvol-Ts color monitor, range, range rate (approach velocity) and relative angular position data are displayed on the “Klest-M” video monitor (VKU) which starts picking up signals from Progress when it is still approximately 8 km away.  TORU is monitored in real time from TsUP over Russian ground sites (RGS) and via Ku-band from Houston, but its control cannot be taken over from the ground.   On 10/30, Progress KURS-A (active) will be activated at 11:06am EDT on Daily Orbit 1 (DO1), SM KURS-P (passive) two minutes later.  Progress video will be switched on at a range of ~9 km, Progress floodlight at ~8 km.  Progress TORU will activate at 3 km range.  Flyaround to the DC1 nadir port (~400 m range, in sunlight) starts at 12:17:28pm, followed by station keeping at 170m at ~12:24:40pm.  Start of final approach: ~12:28:30pm (DO2) in sunlight, contact: ~12:39:30pm.  SM Kurs-P deactivation on mechanical capture.  Sunset: 12:29pm.]
 
 CDR Wheelock unstowed and installed a power cable chain for powering the SSC-14 (Station Support Computer 14) laptop at the Cupola RWS (Robotic Workstation) for ULF5 robotic operations.
 
 Later, Doug worked in the A/L (Airlock) with Scott, checking out the SAFER (Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue) units to be used in the two ULF5 spacewalks.
 
 Other activities completed by Wheels were –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Performing the periodic evacuation of the cylinder flywheels of the ARED exerciser to maintain proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration,</li><li>Conducting the periodic manual filling of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV flush water tank in Node-3, which took about 32 min   [as always, WHC was unavailable during this time],</li><li>Collecting a condensate sample from within the volume of the WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) condensate bus,</li><li>Swapping the WRM condensate tank from the Lab condensate tank to the Node-3 WPA WWT (Water Processor Assembly Waste Water Tank) to collect condensate there   [the WPA Waste water connection and the Lab Condensate tank QP15 and Tee joint share a common set of caps and plugs because only one is connected at any given time],</li><li>Assisting FE-6 Walker with her ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Echo Scan session as CMO (Crew Medical Officer), and</li><li>Powering up the amateur/ham radio equipment in the SM which had been temporarily turned off for the Progress undocking.</li></ul> 
 FE-3 Kelly &amp; FE-6 Walker both worked on the new 24S-delivered HMS (Health Maintenance System) Tonometry hardware &amp; procedures, verifying Tonometer equipment functionality &amp; readiness in microgravity by performing individual eye pressure measurements on an eye simulator.      [Tonometer measurements in micro-G will be used to assess the health of the crew’s eyes.] 
 
 Afterwards, Scott &amp; Shannon conducted a review of the new POC DOUG (Portable Onboard Computers Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) software for the upcoming STS-133/ULF5 robotics activities with the SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System).  Shannon in particular had 2 hrs set aside for this preparation.
 
 Shannon Walker underwent, as subject, her 4<sup>th</sup> (FD135) ICV (Integrated Cardiovascular) Resting Echo Scan in the US Lab, assisted by Wheelock as CMO who helped to operate the scans.     [Wearing electrodes, ECG (Electrocardiograph) cable &amp; VOX, Shannon underwent the ultrasound scan for the Exercise Echo mode of ICV, with video being recorded from the HRF (Human Research Facility) Ultrasound and COL cabin camera.  Heart rate was tracked with the HRM (Heart Rate Monitor).  After confirmed file transfer, the gear was powered down and stowed. The ultrasound echo experiment uses the Image Collector software on the laptop and requires VOX/Voice plus RT Video downlink during the activity.  Goal of the ICV experiment is to quantify the extent, time course, and clinical significance of cardiac atrophy and identify its mechanisms.  The ICV experiment consists of two separate but related activities over a one-week time period: an ultrasound echo scan &amp; an ambulatory monitoring session.  The sessions are scheduled at or around FD14, FD30, FD75, FD135 and R-15 (there will be fewer sessions if mission duration is less than six months).]
 
 Scott Kelly had ~1hr for taking special photographic shots with the D2X digital cameras for starting Photosynth mapping in the FGB, Lab, Node-1, Node-2, Node-3, Airlock, Columbus, Kibo JPM and JLP, with no crewmembers in sight.      [Photosynth is a Microsoft-developed process to turn series of photos into 3-D panoramic vistas.  Photosynth allows everyone (except Mac users) to create unique panoramas or "synths" using their own photos.  Photosynth was already used by NASA last year for RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) photography of the Orbiter underside.  It is being used to create a 3-D rendering of the ISS's interior for training purposes, so astronauts familiarize themselves with their new home before they get there.]
 
 Afterwards, Kelly underwent a session with the U.S. Visual Acuity Testing program, filling out an Eye Questionnaire and downloading it on a laptop for ground access.
 
 Other activities performed by Scott included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Starting another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later  [this was the 35<sup>th</sup> session with the GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 100 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],</li></ul> <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Supporting the SpaceDRUMS/SDRM (Space Dynamically Responding Ultrasonic Matrix System) payload by opening the PSS (Pellet Storage System), inserting shims into gaps between the carousel and carousel guide rails, then closing PSS again,</li><li>Deactivating ALTEA (Anomalous Long Term Effects on Astronauts) Shield dosimetry data collection for 10 min, then reactivating it  [ALTEA-Shield uses existing ALTEA hardware to survey the radiation environment in the US Lab in 3D.  It also measures the effectiveness and shielding properties of several materials with respect to the perception of anomalous Light Flashes],</li><li>Tearing down &amp; stowing the NIFM (Non-Intrusive Flow Meter) which was used for Sabatier flow balancing,</li><li>Assisting Wheels in the A/L with SAFER checkout, and</li><li>Completing the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on Eye Treatment.    [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] </li></ul> 
 FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.     [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PrK–Progress, DC1–Progress, PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment) – RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
 Later, Fyodor performed several hours of IFM (Inflight Maintenance) in the SM, replacing the damper components of the SKV1 air conditioner fan VTK1 and of the VV2RO fan behind panel 333.
 
 Afterwards, FE-5 worked on the SKV2 air conditioner, preparing it for upcoming Khladon (Freon-218) venting and heat exchanger replacement.
 
 With the BITS2-12 onboard measurement telemetry system &amp; VD-SU control mode turned on again after the IFMs, the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator was reactivated by ground commanding, with Yurchikhin monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.    [Temperature is checked twice, about 3-4 minutes apart, with the MultiMeter with temperature probe.  The standard manual check is required because the gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup. Elektron had to be turned off while the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system &amp; VD-SU control mode were temporarily deactivated for the MBRL PU &amp; Z0000 installation.]
 
 Fyodor also completed the regular inspection of the replaceable half-coupling of the 4GB4 hydraulic unit of the KOB-2 (Loop 2) of the Russian SOTR Thermal Control System, checking for coolant fluid hermeticity (leak-tightness).
 
 Alex performed the periodic audit/inventory of RS (Russian Segment) Tsentr medical kits and medical equipment, guided by an uplinked listing identifying equipment to be disposed.
 
 FE-1 Kaleri also –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Set up the video gear to capture his subsequent workout session on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser for subsequent biomechanical evaluation of his performance and hardware status at MCC-H,</li><li>Started and later verified operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the 37P undocking at 10:22am; afterwards, the measurement data were downlinked to the ground  [IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises],</li><li>Completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM  [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers], and</li><li>Installed and started the equipment of the GFI-1 “Relaksatsiya” (Relaxation) Earth Observation experiment at SM window #1 and then used it to observe &amp; measure the high-rate interaction spectra of the Earth’s ionosphere  [using the GFI-1 UFK “Fialka” ultraviolet camera, SP spectrometer and HD (High Definition) camcorder, the experiment observes the Earth atmosphere and surface from window #1, with spectrometer measurements controlled from Laptop 3.  “Relaxation”, in Physics, is the transition of an atom or molecule from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting radiative energy in the process as equilibrium is achieved.]</li></ul> 
 Before crew sleep time, Wheelock will have another PanOptic eye test which requires application of eye drops (Tropicamide [Mydriacyl]) causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination which will be performed on Wheels by Shannon Walker as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) with an ophthalmoscope.      [The procedure, guided by special software on the T61p RoBOT laptop (#1026), captures still &amp; video images of the eye, including the posterior poles, macula &amp; optic disc with the optic nerve, for downlink and expert analysis.]
 
 The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).    [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
