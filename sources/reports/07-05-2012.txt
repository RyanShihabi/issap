ISS On-Orbit Status 07/05/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
Joe Acaba completed his (currently daily) sleep-shift session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, his 18<sup>th</sup> time.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
At wakeup, Sergei Revin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
After switching the Vozdukh CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) removal system to automatic mode, CDR Padalka began the major IFM (Inflight Maintenance) of replacing the Russian BSMM Payload Matching Unit (Multiplex Bus Synchronization Unit) in the SM with the new SUBA BKIPN (Payload Interface Control Unit) computer, assisted in part by Sergei.  After the IFM, Gennady returned Vozdukh to manual control mode.        [The necessary cabling was also routed &amp; mated and the replaceable flash drives installed on the BKIPN.  Afterwards, with BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system plus VD-SU control mode deactivated, the SBI onboard measurement system was connected and operations closed out.  With BITS2-12 and VD-SU turned off for the IFM, the following equipment was deactivated to avoid operation in the absence of real-time telemetry:  1. Elektron (shutdown by crew or ground).  2. SKV air conditioning system (shutdown by crew or ground).  3. Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal unit (no telemetry if in automatic mode, no impact if in manual mode).  4. BMP micropurification unit (automatic shutdown).  5. SRV-K condensate water processor (can be shut down by crew or ground, usually not required).  6. BRI data conversion unit (smart router) is power cycled when VD-SU mode is cycled.   7. Due to the lack of telemetry, there is no dP/dt (pressure drop) detection in the RS (Russian Segment).  8. Fire &amp; smoke alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the PSS (Caution &amp; Warning) panel speaker.  9. Total pressure alarms (audio only) will annunciate onboard in the SM through the PSS speaker.]
 
After retrieving spare hardware and tools (gloves, goggles, mask, Braycote, mirror etc.) from stowage, FE-3 Acaba completed two maintenance tasks on the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) – R&amp;R (removal &amp; replacement) of the SOT wring collector, and R&amp;R of WHC piping.  Afterwards, the equipment was restowed, and the old units were discarded as trash.
 
Sergei executed the periodic data dump from the BRI (SSR/Smart Switch Router) data conversion control log to the RSS1 laptop for downlink to the ground via OCA (Orbiter Communications Adapter).
 
Later, Revin supported the ground in activating the Elektron oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) generator at 32A.     [As usual, FE-2 monitored the external temperature of the Elektron’s secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure no overheating, a standard precaution.  During nominal operations a gas analyzer is utilized to detect hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) but is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.] 
 
Afterwards, FE-2 worked with the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M suite, to check for CO (Carbon Monoxide), Formaldehyde and Ammonia contamination in the SM, recording the measurements.      [CMS uses preprogrammed microchips to measure for numerous contaminants such as O-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Formaldehyde, Isopropanol, Methanol, Toluene, Mercaptan, Sulphur Dioxide, Hydrogen Cyanide, Phosgene, Ozone, Acetic Acid, Ammonia, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitrous Oxides, Acetone, Benzene, Carbon Monoxide, etc.]
 
Sergei also activated and took measurements with the Russian BAOK GANK Real-Time Monitoring Analyzer unit for measuring concentration of harmful contaminants in the air of the RS.       [The BAOK gas analyzer, a subsystem of the SKDS Pressure Control &amp; Atmosphere Monitoring System, determines concentrations of CH<sub>4</sub> (methane), NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia), CO (carbon monoxide), HCN (hydrogen cyanide), HF (hydrofluoric acid) and NO<sub>2</sub> (nitric oxide) from air samples using electrochemical sensors, with measurements displayed on LCD (liquid crystal display) and stored on tapes],
 
Acaba re-installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) at Lab bay S3, engaged the snubber pins and locked safety pins to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances).
 
Joe also completed another weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.        [The current card (31-0005I) lists 14 CWCs (241.1 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. Silver technical water (4 CWCs with 191.9 L; plus 1 empty bag);  2. Condensate water (3 CWCs with 14.0 L, plus 2 empty bags);  3. Iodinated water (3 CWCs with 55.5 L); and 4. Waste water (1 empty bag EMU waste water).  Also one leaky CWC (#1024) with 8.5 L).  No bags with Wautersia bacteria.  Other CWCs are stowed behind racks and are currently not being tracked due to unchanging contents.  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
Using their new iPad handhelds, Padalka, Acaba &amp; Revin underwent a 70-min Emergency OBT (Onboard Training) Simulator Drill, (1) rehearsing ISS emergency response with crew and ground roles based on information provided by iPad simulator displays, (2) translating physically through the station to the appropriate response locations to visualize the use of station equipment &amp; interfaces, and (3) practicing procedure execution and associated decision-making based on cues provided by the simulator program.  A 15-min debrief tagup with the ground followed at ~12:25pm EDT.        [No actual operations were performed with station hardware, except for the reconfiguration of the communications system by the crew and the ground as specified by emergency procedures.  Later, Gennady restored communications settings.]
 
FE-3 filled out his 7<sup>th</sup> FFQ (Food Frequency Questionnaire) on the MDLT (Medical Laptop).       [On the FFQs, USOS astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MDLT software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
Afterwards, Joe completed his weekly task of filling out the SHD (Space Headache) questionnaire which he started after Soyuz launch on a daily basis and continues on ISS (on an SSC/Station Support Computer) for every week after his first week in space.
 
Padalka completed another collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Gennady’s 4<sup>th</sup> time.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Revin performed the periodic transfer of U.S. condensate water from a CWC (Contingency Water Container, #1085) to the RS for the periodic (about twice a month) replenishing of the Elektron’s water supply for electrolysis, filling the designated KOV EDV container (#1000).  Once filled, the EDV is connected to the BPK transfer pump for processing through the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.     [The 40-minute procedure is specially designed to prevent air bubbles larger than ~10 mm from getting into the BZh Liquid Unit where they could cause Elektron shutdown.]
 
Joe again had a time slot/placeholder reserved for making entries in his electronic Journal on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
Sergei completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
FE-2 also took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
At ~8:55am EDT, Joe Acaba supported a PAO TV event, responding to questions from K-12<sup>th</sup> grade students (mostly middle school participants in NASA’s Summer of Innovation Program) at the Science Museum of Virginia at the NASA Langley Research Center.
 
At ~1:50pm, Joe was scheduled for the regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
Before Presleep, Acaba will turn on the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) and start the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-2) and ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-3).  No scheduled VELO exercise reported for FE-2.
