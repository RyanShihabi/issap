All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
 
 FE-1 Lonchakov began his workday by attending to the current experiment session with the Russian/German TEKh-20 Plasma Crystal-3+ (Plazmennyi-Kristall/PK-3+) payload, activating the turbopump in the Service Module (SM)'s Transfer Compartment (PkhO) for keeping the vacuum chamber (ZB) in the SM Work Compartment (RO) evacuated.  The turbopump will be deactivated again tonight at ~4:25pm EST before sleeptime.    [Main objective of PK-3 is to study wave propagation and dispersion ratio in a dust plasma, i.e., fine particles charged and excited by HF (high frequency) radio power inside the evacuated work chamber, at a specified power of HF discharge, pressure, and a varied number of particles.  Today's experiment is performed with 3.42 µm (micrometer) particles, to study crystallization and melting processes as the pressure is varied between 10 and 30 Pa with or without superimposed low–frequency electrical field.  The experiment is run in automatic mode.  PK-3+ has more advanced hardware and software than the previously used Russian PKE-Nefedov payload.]
 
 FE-2 Magnus conducted a “workday survey” SDTO (Station Detailed Test Objective) of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), setting up the handheld CDM (Carbon Dioxide Monitoring) kit close to her breathing zones to measure CO2 concentrations throughout her workday, followed by data download after ~9.5 hrs.
 
 FE-1 Lonchakov took the periodic readings with the Russian AOK GANK-4M Real-Time Harmful Contaminant Gas Analyzer system and calibrated the unit.
 
 CDR Fincke conducted another session with the SHERE (Shear History Extensional Rheology Experiment) payload equipment for more sample runs, going through the usual steps by –
 
 <ul><li>Activating the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) from the A31p laptop,  <li>Powering on the SHERE hardware,  <li>Accessing the CGBA (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus) to install the SHERE FM (Fluid Module) #40 (Test Point 11) for a special force transducer test;  <li>Supporting the first SHERE experiment test run;  <li>Transferring the module with the fluid sample,  <li>Installing FM #52 for the second experiment run (Test Point 46);  <li>Transferring the module with the fluid sample,  <li>Installing FM #60 for the third experiment run (TP 47);  <li>Removing the FM from the CGBA, followed by SHERE data transfer;  <li>Turning off the SHERE/CGBA equipment;  <li>Transferring the data files to the MSG laptop for subsequent downlink, and  <li>Powering down the MSG. 
 </li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
 [Ground investigators are working Mike's request to schedule the remaining SHERE runs for Increment 18 within this week. Background:  Rheology is the study of the deformation and flow of matter under the influence of an applied stress (“preshearing” = rotation) which might be, for example, a shear stress or extensional stress.  In practice, rheology is principally concerned with extending the "classical" disciplines of elasticity and (Newtonian) fluid mechanics to materials whose mechanical behavior cannot be described with the classical theories. SHERE is designed to study the effect of preshear (rotation) on the transient evolution of the microstructure and viscoelastic tensile stresses for solutions with long chains of monodisperse dilute polymer molecules in the MSG.  Collectively referred to as “Boger fluids,” these polymer solutions have become a popular choice for rheological studies of non-Newtonian fluids and are the non-Newtonian fluid used in this experiment.  The SHERE hardware consists of the Rheometer, Camera Arm, Interface Box, Cabling, Keyboard, Tool Box, Fluid Modules, and Stowage Tray.] 
 Performing the regular ~60 min. service of the US WRS (Water Recovery System), FE-2 Magnus – 
 
 <ul><li>Collected the periodic samples from the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) Ambient tap,  <li>Analyzed in-flight samples with the WMK MCD (Water Microbiology Kit/Microbial Capture Devices) for microbial traces, and the CDB (Coliform Detection Bag) for inflight coliform indications (Magenta for Positive, Yellow for Negative), and  <li>Performed data recording and, for conserving water, the usual water reclamation from the sample bags via an absorbing towel (to be dried by airing) and concluded the activities.

 [Coliform bacteria are the commonly-used bacterial indicator of sanitary quality of foods and water.  They are defined as rod-shaped Gram-negative non-spore forming organisms that ferment Lactose with the production of acid and gas when incubated at 35-37 degC.  Coliforms are abundant in the feces of warm-blooded animals, but can also be found in the aquatic environment, in soil and on vegetation. In most instances, coliforms themselves are not the cause of sickness, but they are easy to culture and their presence is used to indicate that other pathogenic organisms of fecal origin may be present.] 
 
 The CDR conducted the periodic status check on the running payloads CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) and ENose (Electronic Nose), both located in the ER-2 (EXPRESS Rack 2).   [ENose monitors the station's interior for harmful chemicals such as ammonia, mercury, methanol and formaldehyde, running continuously and autonomously.  It is the first instrument aboard ISS which can detect and quantify chemical leaks or spills as they happen.  If successful, ENose might be used in future space missions as part of an automated system to monitor and control astronauts' in-space environments.  The shoebox-sized ENose contains an array of 32 sensors that can identify and quantify several organic and inorganic chemicals, including organic solvents and marker chemicals that signal the start of electrical fires.  The sensors are polymer films that change their electrical conductivity in response to different chemicals, where the pattern of the sensor array's response depends on the particular chemical types present in the air.  The instrument can analyze volatile aerosols and vapors, help monitor cleanup of chemical spills or leaks, and enable more intensive chemical analysis by collecting raw data and streaming it to a computer at JPL's ENose laboratory.  The instrument, weighing less than nine pounds and requiring only 20 watts of power, has a wide range of chemical sensitivity, from fractional parts per million to 10,000 parts per million.  Its data-analysis software can identify and quantify the release of chemicals within 40 minutes of detection.  While ENose will look for 10 chemical types in this six-month experiment, it can be “trained” to detect many others.] 
 
 The FE-1 completed the periodic data collection on the long-term BIO-5 Rasteniya-1 ("Plants-1") experiment, copying data from its built-in control computer to a PCMCIA memory card for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.    [Rasteniya-1 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-14 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).  The payload hardware includes a module (MIS/Module for the Investigation of Substrates), the MIS control unit (BU), a nitrogen purge unit (BPA) and other accessories.  During its operation, the experiment requires regular daily maintenance of the experiment involving monitoring of seedling growth, humidity measurements, moistening of the substrate if necessary, and photo/video recording.  LADA consists of a wall-mounted growth chamber that provides long-term, ready access for crewmember interaction.  It provides light and root zone control but relies on the cabin environmental control systems for humidity, gas composition, and temperature control.  Cabin air is pulled into the leaf chamber, flows over the plants and vents through the light bank to provide both plant gas exchange and light bank cooling.] 
 
 In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Mike Fincke supported the end of the checkout of the JEM CGSE (Common Gas Support Equipment) by SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center) at Tsukuba/Japan by shutting off the CO2 gas supply from the upper GBUs (Gas Bottle Units).
 
 After having installed the new Progress-delivered BSK-5V Power Switch Assembly 5V (Blok cilovoiy kommutatsii-5V) for the Russian experiment IMPULSE on 12/4/08, Yuri Lonchakov today took documentary photographs of the switch installation behind SM panels 122 &amp; 124 for OCA downlink and ground review.
 
 In the US A/L (Airlock), Magnus terminated the regeneration of METOX (Metal Oxide) EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) CO2 removal canisters #0012 &amp; #0013 in the “bake-out” oven and installed two more expended canisters (#0015, #0016), in preparation for the STS-119 spacewalks.
 In the SM, near panels 424 &amp; 425, Lonchakov removed the old AGAT-2M audio-video monitor system (which displayed images from a connected computer) and replaced it with a new AGAT-DVD system delivered on Progress 31P.
 
 Sandy Magnus completed another job on the WRS by removing and replacing the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) inside the WRS-2 rack (LAB1P4).   [The job required removal (and restoration) of the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer) with its grounding strap, two CRABs (CEVIS Rack Attachment Brackets) and a Compressor/EDV from the front of the rack and the latter's rotation.]
 
 With the WRS UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) currently not active due to the failure of its DA (Distillation Assembly), Magnus performed the periodic UPA backflow task by emptying its WSTA (Water Storage Tank Assembly) into an empty Russian EDV-U container.     [The offloading of the pretreated urine from the waste tank is required to reduce the pressure in the WSTA which is necessary to disconnect the pretreated urine transfer hose from the LAB1P4 rack.  Normally the pressure is reduced by UPA processing.  A new DA will be delivered on 15A/Discovery.] 
 In preparation for the upcoming Progress M-01M/31P undocking, the FE-1 deinstalled the DC1 SSVP (Docking Compartment Docking &amp; Internal Transfer Mechanism) to 31P.
 
 Lonchakov also completed the routine daily servicing of the SM's SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and performing US condensate processing (transfer from US CWC to Russian EDV containers) if condensate is available.] 
 
 In addition, Yuri performed the regular daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance task by updating/editing the IMS standard “delta file” including stowage locations for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 As part of COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) commissioning (activation &amp; checkout), Sandy installed, connected and turned on the EPM (European Physiology Module) laptop on the EPM seat rack, then calibrated the MEEMM LHB1 (Multi Electrodes Encephalogram Measurement Module Low-Frequency Headbox 1).  Afterwards, the laptop was deactivated and stowed.    [The EPM is a double-rack multi-user facility that supports investigations of respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, hormonal and body fluid shift, bone demineralization and neuroscience.  Human physiology experiments are aimed primarily at increasing our knowledge of how the human body reacts to long-duration weightlessness.  However, this area of research also contributes to an increased understanding of terrestrial problems such as the aging process, osteoporosis, balance disorders, and muscle wasting.  Typical research areas include Neuroscience (neurovestibular control of posture, balance, and motion sensory coordination), Cardiovascular &amp; Respiratory Systems (control of blood volume and distribution; fluid volume shift), Bone &amp; Muscle Physiology (muscle deconditioning/atrophy), and Endocrinology, Nutrition &amp; Metabolism (hormonal regulation; demineralization.]
 At ~11:28am EST, the FE-2 powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and conducted, at 11:33am, a checkout session with a new Telebridge ham radio station in La Paloma, Rocha, Uruguay.
 
 At ~1:15pm, Fincke &amp; Magnus participated in a PAO TV educational event with students at Key Peninsula Middle School, Lakebay, WA.   [Anticipated VIPs in attendance were to be General John Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Vice Commander Colonel Michael J. Hornitschek from McChord Air Force Base; Dr. Bonnie Dunbar, former shuttle astronaut and currently CEO of Museum of Flight; Chris C. Kemp, CIO of NASA Ames Research Center and State Senator Derek Kilmer.]
 
 VolSci Preview:   Five optional activities for the Voluntary Science program on days 1/31 &amp; 2/1 were suggested to Mike &amp; Sandy for their choice.  Selection is required by tonight.    [The session choices are: (1) Investigating the Structure of Paramagnetic Aggregates from Colloidal Emulsions-2 (InSPACE-2), (2) Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites (SPHERES); (3) Lab-On-A-Chip Application Development (LOCAD) – Portable Test System (PTS); (4) Video Lesson ESA – 1 (VLE-1) – “Design elements that improve living/working”; and (5) Braslet.]
 
 SPDM Checkout:  Ground controllers yesterday performed a Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator checkout operations.   [This is part of a 6 session ground control checkout plan to prepare for an SPDM ORU swap later this year.  The SSRMS (Space Station Remote Manipulator System), based on MBS PDGF3 (Mobile Remote Servicer Base System Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture #3), was maneuvered to and grappled the SPDM, which had started the day based on the LAB PDGF.  The SPDM “Dextre” will then be released from the LAB PDGF and maneuvered at the end of SSRMS to an overnight park position in free space.  Today, ground controllers performed the first checkout of SPDM operating modes, and on 1/23 there will be several hours for data gathering from the SPDM Force &amp; Moment Sensors.  The SPDM will be returned to the LAB PDGF next Monday.]
 
 The station residents conducted their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (CDR), TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2), IRED interim resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2) and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
 
 CEO photo target uplinked for today was Mumbai, India Aerosol (looking right towards the limb for the smoke-dust-smog haze drifting out to sea from greater Mumbai.  Conditions are good for acquiring images of this phenomenon: high atmospheric pressure, sea as backdrop, and Sun relatively low and look angle strongly oblique [which lengthens line of sight, making aerosol more apparent to the viewer].  Atmospheric layering—with layer colors expected to differ—is especially interesting to atmospheric chemists.  It is very helpful to get some of the coastline included in some of the images).
 
 CEO photography can be studied at this “Gateway” website:
