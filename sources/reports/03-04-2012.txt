ISS On-Orbit Status 03/04/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday – Crew off duty.   Ahead:  Week 15 of Increment 30 (six-person crew).
 
After breakfast, FE-2 Ivanishin performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.  
 
FE-4 Kononenko did the (currently daily) inspection of the KOB2 cooling loop in the SM, checking a liquid connector on the 4SPN2 panel for coolant leaks.     [In case there were any large droplets (10-20 cm<sup>3</sup>), FE-4 was to report to TsUP-Moscow.  After the recovery of KOB2 on 3/1 by replacing a K-90 commutator (switching unit), the loop was tested successfully and then turned off again.  It is considered fully functional.  While TsUP is currently monitoring the pressure, the crew is checking behind the 4SPN2 panel for leaks.  KOB2 will then be activated.]
 
In response to the failure of the WPA (Water Processor Assembly, see 3/3 Status Report), FE-6 Pettit set up the equipment for pumping water from CWC-I (Contingency Water Container-Iodinated, #2016) to the WPA (Water Processor Assembly) potable water tank using a “tee” hose and a fresh MRF (Microbial Removal Filter) as gas trap.  After several hours of transfer, the CWC-I was swapped (with CWC #2018).  Later, Don terminated the procedure and tore the equipment down, using Povidone iodine wipes for cleanup.
 
In Node-3, with the G1 high-resolution camcorder recording for MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) downlink, Burbank completed the periodic manual fill of the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment) EDV-SV (condensate container) flush water tank from the PWB (Potable Water Bus) for about 23 min, a partial fill during which WHC was not available,
 
FE-1 Shkaplerov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM and FGB.      [This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.  SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
In the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-5 Kuipers supported JAXA ground operations on the PROX Proximity Communication System for the HTV3 (H-II Transfer Vehicle 3) by powering on PROX in the ICS (Inter-Satellite Communication System) Rack and verifying proper HCP (H-II Control Panel) connection for the ground to turn HCP switches on and off.      [Ground commanding was then to power on the PROX ORUs (Orbit Replaceable Units) and to set ORU parameters to allow PROX Checkout from the ground, for checking the communication link between C&amp;C MDM (Multiplexer/Demultiplexer) computer and PROX 2 for routing HTV telemetry to the RWS (Robotic Workstations) via RMAD Data Source.  The checkout also applies to support of the Cygnus spacecraft.  The activities are an integrated procedure between the FCTs (Flight Control Teams) for JEM, HTV (at Tanegashima), USOS (at Houston) and the ISS crew.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-2).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions, followed by a USND leg muscle self scan in COL.  Today’s exercise called for CEVIS, ARED+T2, T2, ARED+CEVIS (VO<sub>2</sub>max), CEVIS following in the next 4 days.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.]
 
At ~4:15am EST, Anton Shkaplerov, Ivanishin &amp; Oleg Kononenko participated in an event set up for them in Moscow to cast their ballot in today’s Russian Federation Presidential Elections, formally authorizing their proxy agent Dmitry Alexandrovich Zhukov to fill out the ballot for them, with the required confidentiality being observed.         [Alexander Ivanovich Popkov, chairman of the local election committee of Korolev City, Moscow Region, explained the ballot procedure and read out the ballot bulletin, then asked each of the three cosmonauts, “Do you authorize Dmitry Alexandrovich Zhukov to fill out ballot bulletins thus giving effect to your will?”  After filling out the forms with each crewmember in seclusion (with ISS modules serving as voting booths), D. A. Zhukov invited the participants to the voting room and dropped the ballots in a portable box while providing voice commentary of his actions to Anton, Anatoly &amp; Oleg.  Besides a group of political and communal VIPs, assembled media included ZVEZDA TV, Channel One, Moscow Regional TV Channel, Korolev TV and the GCTC Press Service.]
