Progress (71P) Launch:  71P successfully launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome today at 12:14PM CT.  71P will be performing a 34 orbit rendezvous with ISS, which sets the stage for docking on Sunday at 1:29PM CT.  
Life Sciences Glovebox (LSG) Integration:  The crew performed tasks to install work volume filters, deploy the LSG Laptop, and made rack-to-rack connections to EXpedite the PRocessing of Experiments for Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack 4. The LSG was then successfully commissioned by ground teams. The LSG is a sealed work area that accommodates life science and technology investigations in a “workbench” type environment. Due to its larger size design, two crewmembers can work in the LSG simultaneously. 
Meteor:  The crew removed and replaced the hard drive in the Meteor laptop. The Meteor payload is a visible spectroscopy instrument used to observe meteors in Earth orbit. Meteor uses image analysis to provide information on the physical and chemical properties of the meteoroid dust, such as size, density, and chemical composition. The study of the meteoroid dust on orbit provides information about the parent comets and asteroids. 
Veggie-03:  Veggie-03 plants were checked for growth progression and watered as necessary.  The Vegetable Production System (Veggie) is a deployable plant growth unit capable of producing salad-type crops to provide the crew with a palatable, nutritious, and safe source of fresh food and a tool to support relaxation and recreation.
Northrop Grumman 10 (NG-10) Cygnus On-board Training:  Today, the crew performed a second training session utilizing the Robotics Onboard Trainer (ROBoT). ROBoT is an on-orbit version of the ground-based Dynamics Skills Trainer (DST) that simulates robotics operations with graphical feedback. NG-10 Antares 230 Rocket is on track to launch on Saturday, November 17 at 3:01AM CT.  Cygnus capture is planned for Monday, November 19 at 4:20AM CT.
