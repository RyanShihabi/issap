ISS On-Orbit Status 08/14/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Sunday – Crew off-duty.  Ahead: Week 22 of Increment 27/28. 
  
This morning at ~6:46am EDT, the ISS (specifically its FGB “Zarya” module) completed 73,000 orbits of the Earth, having covered a distance of 3.09 billion kilometers (1.92 billion st.miles) in about 4650 days.   [The 19,300-kg/42,600-lbs Zarya (“Dawn”) was launched on a Russian/Khrunichev Proton from Baikonur almost 13 years ago, on 11/20/1998, as the first element of the multi-national space station.]
 
As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, CDR Borisenko checked out the SM (Service Module) PSS caution &amp; warning panel.
 
Borisenko also inspected the newly activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, checking for proper fan operation by testing the air flow from the ventilators BO A04 &amp; BO A05 and verifying that both LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are lit.     [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).] 
 
In the Node-3 Cupola, FE-5 Furukawa deactivated the JAXA SSHDTV (Super Sensitive High-Definition Television) after it had been recording Perseid Meteor Shower occurrences for the past 3 days.
 
FE-3 Garan used the two hand-held CSA-O<sub>2</sub> (Compound Specific Analyzer-Oxygen) units from the Lab P4 rack location, #1043 &amp; #1048, to take the periodic O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) check in SM (Service Module) and COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) at mid-module, prior to today’s Progress oxygen repress.     [O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure values, battery ticks of each monitor and GMT time of activity were then reported to MCC-Houston.  The CSA-O<sub>2</sub> devices are used to help track O<sub>2</sub> concentration while the MCA (Major Constituents Analyzer) is down.]
 
With the Russian Elektron oxygen generator currently inactive, depending on Ron’s CSA-O<sub>2</sub> measurements, FE-4 Volkov was to initiate another refresh of the ISS interior with an O<sub>2 </sub>repress from Progress 43P tankage on Go-ahead from TsUP-Moscow.
 
Sergei also conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.  This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.      [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
At ~11:00am, Andrey, Sasha &amp; Sergei supported two Russian PAO TV events, downlinking messages of greetings to (1) educators of the Republic of Tatarstan, and (2) visitors posting questions on the Roskosmos website.     [(1) On 8/22, Almetievsk (Republic of Tatarstan) will be hosting the August meeting of Tatarstan educators where they are going to discuss their issues and goals for the next academic year. This forum will be attended by Russian Federation Minister of Education &amp; Science A.A. Fursenko, Republic of Tatarstan President R.N. Minnihanov, ministry and agency executives, administration heads, corporate CEOs, managers of Tatarstan regional municipal education departments, honored educators from Russia and the Republic of Tatarstan. This event will be attended by over 3500 people.  (2)  Alexey Platonov, 34, from Moscow, asked on the Roskosmos website, “Good day, or maybe night (I don’t know which side of the Earth you will be on when you get this message), our dear space conquerors Andrey, Sergey and Alexander!  I would like to ask you this question: As you perform orbital science studies and experiments for the Russian space program, do you also help your foreign colleagues in their experiments? Do they help you?”]
 
CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-4 &amp; FE-5 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sergei at ~6:30am, Andrey at ~8:15am, Sasha at ~10:00am, Ron at ~12:40pm, Satoshi at ~4:30pm EDT.  FE-6 Fossum had his PFC yesterday.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
