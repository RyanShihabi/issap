ISS On-Orbit Status 06/25/12
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Underway:  Week 9 of Increment 31 (six-person crew).
 
After wakeup, Oleg Kononenko performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
The CDR also conducted the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM of a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
FE-5 Kuipers had Day 4 of the pH test and diet log entry for the Pro K pH plus controlled diet menu protocol of his 5<sup>th</sup> (FD180) Pro K Controlled Diet activity with diet logging after the urine pH spot test, for a 5-day period after start of collections.  After recording his diet input today, André began the urine collections for his Nutrition/Repository/Pro K 24-hour protocol and prepared the equipment for the associated blood sampling tomorrow (6/26).       [For the Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery) protocol, there are five in-flight sessions (FD15, FD30, FD60, FD120, FD180) of samplings, to be shared with the NUTRITION w/Repository protocol, each one with five days of diet &amp; urine pH logging and photography on the last day.  The crewmember prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.  Urine collections are spread over 24 hrs; samples go into the MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) within 30 min after collection.  Blood samples, on the last day, are centrifuged in the RC (Refrigerated Centrifuge) and placed in MELFI at -80 degC.  There is an 8-hr fasting requirement prior to the blood draw (i.e., no food or drink, but water ingestion is encouraged).  MELFI constraints:  Maximum MELFI Dewar open time: 60 sec; at least 45 min between MELFI dewar door openings.  Background on pH: In chemistry, pH (Potential Hydrogen) is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a watery solution.  Pure water is neutral, with a pH close to 7.0 at 25 degC.  Solutions with a pH less than 7 are “acidic” and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are “basic” or “alkaline”.  pH measurements are important in medicine, biology, chemistry, agriculture, forestry, food science, environmental science, oceanography, civil engineers and many others.]
 
In the SM, FE-1 Padalka collected the “three-days-prior-to-landing” KAV condensate water sample from the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor (Water Recovery System) upstream of the FGS gas/liquid mixture filter/separator and the BKO water purification (multifiltration) unit.    [Sampler &amp; separator removal and sample transfer are scheduled tomorrow and disposed of flush water.]
 
Kononenko, Kuipers &amp; Pettit joined for the regular 30-min fit check of their Kentavr anti-G suits for their return to Earth on Soyuz 29S, followed by a 10 min teleconference with Kentavr specialists.      [The “Centaur” garment (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Chibis" lower body negative pressure suit) is a protective anti-G suit ensemble to facilitate the return of a long-duration crewmember into the Earth gravity.  Consisting of shorts, gaiters, underpants, jersey and socks, it acts as countermeasure for circulatory disturbance, prevents crewmembers from overloading during descent and increases orthostatic tolerance during post-flight adaptation.  Russian crewmembers are also advised to ingest fluid-electrolyte additives, viz., three sodium chloride tablets during breakfast and after the midday meal, each time with 300 ml of fluid, and two pills during the meal aboard Soyuz before deorbit.] 
 
Afterwards, Oleg continued the current round of periodic preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, today working in the SM for cleaning its numerous Group A ventilator fans &amp; grilles.
 
In the MRM1 Rassvet, FE-2 Revin replaced the SKPF1&amp; SKPF2 dust filters and cleaned the GZhT gas/liquid heat exchanger fan grill.  The old filter cartridges were trashed and the IMS (Inventory Management System) updated.
 
At ~4:15am EDT, Sergei closed the protective shutters of the SM windows to prevent their contamination from the ZUG &amp; ZUO hydraulic connectors during ATV-3 prop line purging (4:18am-4:23am).     [Windows 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 were closed manually, window 9 remotely from laptop.]
 
Revin also continued his work on the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, transferring the KASKAD bioreactor to the KT thermal enclosure, later relocating it to the TBU incubator (+4 degC), taking documentary photography, then disconnecting KT from the RBS power outlet for stowage and photography.  The TBU-V incubator in MRM1 was finally torn down.
 
Gennady Padalka conducted part of the standard windows inspection, today on the windows VL1 in the DC1 Docking Compartment and VL2 in MRM2 Poisk.         [Objective of the inspection, which uses a digital still camera (Nikon D2X w/SB-28DX flash) and voice recorder, is to assess the pane surfaces on RS for any changes (new cavities, scratches, new or expanded old stains or discolorations affecting transparency properties) since the last inspection.  The new assessment will be compared to the earlier observations.  Defects are measured with the parallax method which uses eyeball-sighting with a ruler and a right isosceles triangle to determine the defects' size and position with respect to the window's internal surface (parallax being the apparent change in an object's position resulting from changing the observer's position).]
 
FE-3 Acaba underwent his 2<sup>nd</sup> session with the U.S. PFE (Periodic Fitness Evaluation) protocol as subject, a monthly 1.5-hr. procedure which checks up on BP (blood pressure) &amp; ECG (electrocardiogram) during programmed exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer in the US Lab.  Readings were taken with BP/ECG equipment and the HRM (heart rate monitor) watch with its radio transmitter.  André Kuipers assisted as Operator/CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  The BP/ECG recordings were later transferred from the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) via USB thumb drive to an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for downlink to the ground.        [BP/ECG provides automated noninvasive systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements while also monitoring and displaying accurate heart rates on a continual basis at rest and during exercise.] 
 
Afterwards, Joe supported JAXA in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) with the final checkout of the JEMRMS (JEM Robotic Manipulator System) in preparation for the HTV-3 (H-2 Transfer Vehicle 3) arrival on 7/27.     [Steps included activating the RLT (Robotics Laptop) for MA (Main Arm) operations, starting, configuring &amp; reviewing the DOUG (Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics) application for JRMRMS checkout, then activating CCP (Crew Command Panel), RMS Monitors and transitioning to Brake Mode.  After the checkout, the AL (Airlock) was depressurized in Auto Mode for a subsequent leak check, then repressurized.  Monitors, CCP &amp; RLT were deactivated, switches
reconfigured for ground control operations and DOUG cables removed &amp; transferred.]
 
Later, Acaba worked on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack), preparing it for upcoming payload operations by reviewing procedural material, retrieving &amp; pre-staging hardware for MDCA (Multi-User Droplet Combustion Apparatus) replacement, and setting up the MWA WSA (Maintenance Work Area Work Surface Area).     [The upcoming work involves the complete removal of the MDCA CIA (Chamber Insert Assembly).  On the removed CIA, Joe will replace the MDCA Fuel Reservoir in Location 1 because a different type of fuel is required in this location. Next, he will replace the MDCA Fiber Arm because a Fiber Arm with cross fibers is required for the upcoming MDCA FLEX-2 test points.  Following these replacements, the ground can begin Convective Flow test points for MDCA FLEX-2.]
 
FE-6 Pettit set up the USND (Ultrasound) with video camcorder and MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), placed reference markers on the thigh and calf of his right leg and donned the SPRINT thigh and calf guides and then, with the help of André Kuipers, performed a SPRINT leg scan with remote guidance from ground teams, his 7<sup>th</sup>.        [SPRINT (Integrated Resistance and Aerobic Training Study) evaluates the use of high intensity, low volume exercise training to minimize loss of muscle, bone, and cardiovascular function in ISS crewmembers during long-duration missions.]
 
In the Kibo laboratory, Don had ~1 hr to perform stowage consolidation and relabeling of all stowage lockers for JAXA-allocated stowage.     [JAXA hardware and bags in Kibo were cleaned, since some items needed to be stowed together for future return or maintenance task.  Also, some contents labels still showed Inc-18 stowage info and required updating.] 
 
Later, after the ATV-3 prop purging, FE-6 opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment and activated the ISSAC laptop, so ground images can be captured by ground commanding.        [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
With the KPT-2 TTM battery freshly charged in the morning, Padalka &amp; Revin used the KPT-2 payload suite of BAR science instruments, with Piren-V and TTM-2, for another 2h session of conducting air temperature and humidity monitoring behind FGB panels 422 &amp; 404-405 to fill the mapped database to populate the mapped RS data base.       [KPT-2 monitors problem areas, necessary to predict shell micro-destruction rate and to develop measures to extend station life.  Data are copied to the RSE1 laptop for downlink to Earth via OCA, with photographs, and the activities are supported by ground specialist tagup as required.  Objective of the Russian KPT-2/BAR science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind RS panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  Piren-V is a video-endoscope with pyrosensor, part of the methods &amp; means being used on ISS for detecting tiny leaks in ISS modules which could lead to cabin depressurization.  Besides KPT-2 Piren-V, the payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer / thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU-1) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
Oleg &amp; Gennady had ~1 hr together for Inc-31/Inc-32 handover activities.
 
Sergei Revin performed the periodic service of the RS radiation payload suite “Matryoshka-R” (RBO-3-2), collecting eight Bubble dosimeters (A41, A42, A43, A44, A45, A46, A47, A48) to read their recorded radiation traces in a special Reader.  Afterwards the dosimeters were initialized for new measurements, redeployed at specific locations and photographed.        [The complex Matryoshka payload suite is designed for sophisticated radiation studies.  Note: Matryoshka is the name for the traditional Russian set of nested dolls.] 
 
Later, Sergei broke out and set up the equipment for another session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis, scheduled tomorrow for Oleg, Gennady, André and himself.        [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s /special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).]
 
The CDR took care of the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Oleg also conducted the daily IMS maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
FE-2 conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
Kononenko completed his 5<sup>th</sup> OOHA (On-Orbit Hearing Assessment) test, a 30-minute NASA environmental health systems examination to assess the efficacy of acoustic countermeasures and monitor crew hearing status on-orbit, using a special software application on the SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop.      [The self-administered OOHA test is a variation of conventional audiometric testing, in which the crewmember determines minimum audibility for tones, over a wide range of frequencies (0.25-10 kHz) and sound pressure levels, in each ear.  While wearing custom-made Prophonics earphones and Bose active noise reduction headsets, the crewmember uses special EarQ software on the SSC to determine the lowest sound pressure level at which the tone can still be heard.  The first on-orbit test is required not later than about Flight Day 14 for each new Expedition and is then generally performed once per 45 days thereafter.  Results are then reviewed by medical personnel and compared to pre-flight OOHA data and also to previous on-orbit OOHA results.  Note: There have been temporary shifts in hearing sensitivity documented on some crewmembers, most of which have recovered to pre-mission levels.]
 
The 29S crew, Kononenko, Pettit &amp; Kuipers, had another hour set aside each for personal crew departure preparations which are standard pre-return procedures for crewmembers.
 
Don &amp; Joe had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.    [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
FE-5 performed regular maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device), inspecting and greasing its VIS (Vibration Isolation System) Y- &amp; Z-axes rails &amp; rollers and upper stops.
 
Before today’s T2 exercise sessions, Pettit closed down the T2 software on its laptop for data transfer, then turned off the T2 display.     [After the display shutdown, the T2 rack is power cycled (turned off/on) from the ground, and T2 is then ready for use.  These power cycles allow for the T2 data to be transferred to the Server for downlink.] 
 
Don conducted his session on the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill with the Treadmill Kinematics protocol, setting up the HD camcorder in Node-1, placing tape markers on his body, recording a calibration card in the FOV (Field of View) and then conducting the workout run within a specified speed range.  The video was later downlinked by Don via MPC.       [Purpose of the Kinematics T2 experiment is to collect quantitative data by motion capture from which to assess current exercise prescriptions for participating ISS crewmembers.  Detailed biomechanical analyses of locomotion will be used to determine if biomechanics differ between normal and microgravity environments and to determine how combinations of external loads and exercise speed influence joint loading during in-flight treadmill exercise.  Such biomechanical analyses will aid in understanding potential differences in gait motion and allow for model-based determination of joint &amp; muscle forces during exercise. The data will be used to characterize differences in specific bone and muscle loading during locomotion in the two gravitational conditions.  By understanding these mechanisms, appropriate exercise prescriptions can be developed that address deficiencies.]
 
Before exercising on the ARED, Gennady Padalka set up and checked out the G1 video camera in Node-3 for it to record his workout session and those of the other crewmembers on the machine (except FE-2), meeting the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.  Afterwards, the video footage was stowed by Gennady.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5, FE-6), and VELO bike ergometer with load trainer (FE-2).      [FE-6 is on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Fridays.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  If any day is not completed, Don picks up where he left off, i.e., he would be finishing out the week with his last day of exercise on his off day.  Today’s exercise called for ARED+T2 (Kinematics), with T2 (aerobic/interval), ARED+T2 (resistive+aerobic/continuous) and CEVIS (aerobic/interval) following in the next 3 days.] 
 
At ~3:10pm EDT, Pettit is scheduled for the periodic VHF-1 emergency communications proficiency check over NASA’s VHF (Very High Frequency) stations, today with the VHF site at WHI/White Sands (3:11:42pm-3:18:44pm), for a voice check with Houston/Capcom, MSFC/PAYCOM (Payload Operation &amp; Integration Center Communicator), Moscow/GLAVNI (TsUP Capcom), EUROCOM/Munich and JCOM/Tsukuba in the normal fashion via VHF radio from a handheld microphone and any of the USOS ATUs (Audio Terminal Units).        [Purpose of the test is to verify signal reception and link integrity, improve crew proficiency, and ensure minimum required link margin during emergency (no TDRS) and special events (such as a Soyuz relocation).]
 
Tasks listed for Kononenko, Revin &amp; Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
 
JAXA Marangoni Experiment:   Tonight, JAXA will perform the first Marangoni experiment with a liquid bridge. At 5:30pm-2:00am, the crew should pay scrupulous attention to not to generate disturbances since a liquid bridge is very sensitive to g-jitter.
 
Conjunction Advisory:   Flight Controllers are tracking a conjunction with Object 32766 (Pegasus Rocket Body) with TCA (Time of Closest Approach) on 6/28, 5:28am EDT.      [This object is tracked well and has ballistic properties about the same as ISS which means it will respond to atmospheric perturbations in a similar manner - we should not expect to see large changes as we would expect with some debris.  Flight Control will continue to collect data on this event and provide updates per nominal procedures.]
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
