53 Soyuz (53S) Launch: 53S launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome this morning with Anton Shkaplerov, Scott Tingle, and Norishige Kanai.  Docking to the Mini Research Module-1 (MRM-1) module is scheduled for 02:42 AM CST on December 19 with hatch opening at ~4:15 AM CST. 
SpaceX (SpX)-13 Capture and Berthing: SpX-13 rendezvous and capture were successfully completed today at 11:02 AM CST using the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). The crew monitored Dragon’s approach from the Cupola Robotic Workstation. During capture the Latch End Effector (LEE) snare cable tension went above the expected value, and before resuming nominal operation the Robotics Ground Controllers commanded the LEE mechanism to reduce this tension to the expected range. Dragon was berthed at 7:30 AM CST by ground controllers.  Vestibule outfitting, vehicle ingress and removal of the center stack began following capture.
