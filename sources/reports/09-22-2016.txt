Story Time From Space: FE-6 completed the video recording that was started yesterday that demonstrates how a balance scale can be used to exhibit balance in microgravity.  Story Time From Space combines science literacy outreach with simple demonstrations recorded aboard the ISS. Crew members read five science, technology, engineering and mathematics-related children’s books in orbit, and complete simple science concept experiments. Crew members videotape themselves reading the books and completing demonstrations. Video and data collected during the demonstrations are downlinked to the ground and posted in a video library with accompanying educational materials. 
Water Monitoring Suite – Microbial Monitoring System (WMS-MMS): FE-6 performed two MMS runs today.  Both runs were obtained from the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (TOCA) water analysis sample bag, and analysis will be performed on ISS unfiltered water.  The first utilized a low DNA concentration pouch, the second the high DNA concentration pouch. The WMS is a set of hardware that monitors microbes, silica and organic material in the water supply on the ISS. The hardware ensures crew members can test and monitor the safety of their water supplies on future space missions, especially on long-duration missions to Mars, asteroids or other destinations where Earth-based testing would be difficult or impossible. 
Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Urine Hydraulic Components Remove & Replace (R&R): The crew performed preventive maintenance to R&R the urine valve block, urine lines, urine pressure sensors and WHC flush water tank empty pressure sensor.
Ocular Ultrasounds:  FE-5 and FE-6 assisted each other in performing routine medical eye imaging ultrasound.  The ultrasound images will be used to identify changes in globe morphology and document optic nerve sheath diameter, optic nerve sheath tortuosity, globe axial measurements, and choroidal engorgement.
