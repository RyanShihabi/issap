Space Headaches:  Peake completed his Weekly Space Headaches questionnaire today. Headaches can be a common complaint during spaceflight. The Space Headaches experiment will provide information that may help in the development of methods to alleviate associated symptoms and improvement the well-being and performance of crew members in space.
 
Space Acceleration Measurement System Sensor (SAMS)-II: Kopra moved the SAMS Sensor Enclosure from US Lab to the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). SAMS-II is an ongoing study of the small forces (vibrations and accelerations) on the ISS resulting from the operation of hardware, crew activities, dockings, and maneuvering. Results generalize the types of vibrations affecting vibration-sensitive experiments. Investigators seek to better understand the vibration environment on the ISS.
 
Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS): Kopra disconnected and stowed hardware used for the BASS investigation. BASS examined the burning and extinction characteristics of a wide variety of fuel samples in microgravity and is used to guide strategies for extinguishing accidental fires in microgravity. Its results contribute to the combustion computational models used in the design of fire detection and suppression systems in microgravity and on Earth.
 
Urine Processing Assembly (UPA) Status: Upon further investigation it was discovered that Quick Disconnect (QD)26 connected to the Pressure Control and Pump Assembly (PCPA) was not fully mated. The crew mated the QD, the pressure dropped and UPA was taken to Standby. A process cycle was initiated followed by a recurrence of DA belt slippage. The DA transitioned to Shutdown. The UPA will be allowed to cool down prioir to another attempt.
ISS Reboost With 61 Progress (61P): A reboost is planned tonight at 10:15 PM CST using 61P thrusters. The reboost is to set up conditions for 46S 4-orbit rendezvous on March 19.
