Aniso Tubule Experiment Operations:  Today Flight Engineer (FE)-6 Wakata retrieved the Aniso Tublule sample from the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) door where he had put it earlier this week, watered it, and placed it on the Multi-Purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR) fluorescent microscope for 48 hours of observation.  He placed the remainder of the sample from this third Aniso Tubule run into a +4 degrees dewar of a Minus Eighty Degree Celsius Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI).  The Aniso Tubule experiment investigates the roles of cortical microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins in gravity-induced growth modification of plant stems.
Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) Fill:  As part of routine maintenance, Hopkins performed manual fill of the Flush Water Tank utilizing the Hydraulic Interface Control Panel.
Express Rack 2 Active Rack Isolation System (ARIS) Hardware Removal and Rack Modification:  Wakata and FE-5 Mastracchio removed ARIS hardware from Express Rack 2 and modified the rack with K-BARs (Knee brace Bolt Action Replacement) and standard pivot pins. Completion of the rack modification allows the rack to be rotated down more easily.
Internal Audio Controller (IAC) Transition:  Overnight, the USOS Audio Subsystem experienced a Fault Detection, Isolation, and Recovery (FDIR) software induced transition from IAC2 to IAC1.  In addition, the Audio Subsystem continues to experience Passive Built in Test (PBIT) faults associated with Fiber Optic Channel B on numerous audio components. Attempts to clear the PBIT faults have not been successful. Flight Controllers will continue their troubleshooting efforts over the weekend.  The system is currently operating nominally on its redundant Fiber Optic Channel “A”.
