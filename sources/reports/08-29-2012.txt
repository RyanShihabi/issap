ISS On-Orbit Status 08/29/12
<a name="_GoBack"></a> 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.
  
After wakeup and breakfast, CDR Padalka performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Upon wakeup, FE-5 Williams &amp; FE-6 Hoshide conducted their post-sleep session of the Reaction Self-Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self-Test on the ISS) protocol, currently performed daily, the 18<sup>th</sup> time for both.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
FE-2 Sergei Revin serviced the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment, extracting the top of the bioreactor (#6) from the TBU-V incubator (+29 degC), shaking it with “moderately strong” movements for 2 minutes without taking it out of the case and inserting it again in TBU-V.      [Started on 8/23, this activity is being carried out for 21 days, once in the morning and once in the evening.]
 
Padalka, Malenchenko &amp; Revin completed the periodic pre-breakfast session of the Russian biomedical routine assessment PZEh-MO-7/Calf Volume Measurement.  Afterwards, Gennady, Yuri &amp; Sergei were joined by Joe Acaba, Sunita Williams &amp; Akihiko Hoshide in completing the PZEh-MO-8/Body Mass Measurement using the IMT mass measurement device, set up (and later cleaned up and stowed away) by Revin.        [For determining body mass in zero-G, where things are weightless but not massless, the Russian IMT "scales" for MO-8 measure the inertial forces that arise during the oscillatory motion of a mass driven by two helical metering springs with known spring constants.  By measuring the time period of each oscillation of the unknown mass (the crewmember) and comparing it to the period of a known mass, the crewmember’s mass is calculated by the computer and displayed. MO-7 Calf measurements (left leg only) are taken with the IZOG device, a custom-sewn fabric cuff that fits over the calf, using the knee and lower foot as fixed reference pints, to provide a rough index of deconditioning in zero-G and effectiveness of countermeasures.]
 
Afterwards, Revin conducted his 4<sup>th</sup> session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.       [Padalka stood by to assist Sergei in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit plus taking documentary photography.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
Yuri Malenchenko configured the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his 2<sup>nd</sup>, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure.  The experiment was then closed out and the test data were downlinked via OCA.       [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
Sergei conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
FE-4 took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance from the discretionary “time permitting” task list, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
Yuri also conducted the periodic 2-hr IMS-based inventory/audit of all medical kits in the RS including removing/replacing medications as required and checking on remaining food supplements (salt, Vitamin C, etc.).  Removed kits were disposed of in Progress 48P which had delivered fresh medical supplies.
 
Williams, Hoshide &amp; Acaba conducted another one-hour procedures review of tomorrow’s EVA-18 by Suni &amp; Aki, going through uplinked updated material, then tagged up with spacewalk planners at MCC-Houston for detailed discussions.     [Spacewalkers Suni &amp; Aki will egress the A/L (Airlock) hatch at ~8:15am EDT, for an outside duration of ~6h 30m (i.e., ingress ~2:45pm).  EVA-18 objectives are:
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Connect &amp; route two power cables (#651, #413) for the yet-to-arrive Russian MLM (Multipurpose Laboratory Module) between the FGB &amp; US Segment (future Russian EVA will complete the cable layouts and provide US power to MLM &amp; SM via all 4 MBSUs [Main Bus Switching Units], instead of current configuration where only two are used to power SM),
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Remove the failed MBSU1 and replace it with the spare MBSU, 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Install failed MBSU1 in stbd ESP-1 FSE (External Stowage Platform 1 Flight Support Equipment),
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Remove failed SSRMS Boom B CLPA (Camera, Light, Pan/Tilt Assembly) and replace with spare CLPA.
Get-aheads (time permitting) are: 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Install PMA-2 MMOD/thermal cover, 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Remove &amp; replace MBS (Mobile Base System) mast CLPA, 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Replace JEF VE (JEM Exposed Facility Vision Equipment) fwd camera+light, 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Troubleshoot FGB PDGF (Power &amp; Data Grapple Fixture), and 
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>Reconfigure EVA tools (WIF/Worksite Interface Fixture Extender).]
 
Williams &amp; Hoshide worked in the A/L E-LK (Equipment Lock), completing final preparations of the compartment, the two EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units) and their ancillary hardware to support tomorrow’s excursion.
 
The spacewalkers also had an extra hour set aside to assemble and configure EVA tools &amp; equipment including PGTs (Pistol Grip Tools), two EVA cameras (28mm &amp; 10.5mm lenses), tethers &amp; fish-stringers, Orlan Pille radiation dosimeters transferred from the RS (Russian Segment) earlier by Yuri Malenchenko, water-filled DIBs (disposable in-suit drinking bags) etc.
 
For further preparation, Aki retrieved the hatch contingency tool kit from PMA-1 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 1) and stowed it for immediate readiness with the PBA (Portable Breathing Apparatus) units in the “Quest” A/L (loc. 101).
 
Gennady Padalka meanwhile performed a 5-hr IFM (Inflight Maintenance) on the Russian SEP (EPS/(Electrical Power System) in the SM behind panels 226 &amp; 227, removing &amp; replacing the 800A battery #4 along with its PTAB-1M current converter and BUPT-1M PTAB current control unit with new spares.  The old parts were prepared for disposal on Progress 48P.       [The battery’s ZRU charge/discharge unit #4 was deactivated by TsUP/Moscow beforehand and reactivated later.  Each of the eight 800A 28 Volt batteries in the SM (the FGB has six) has its own ZRU charge/discharge unit, which tracks 49 battery parameters and is designed to increase the operating life of the battery by setting up charging &amp; discharging modes.  Each ZRU is comprised of one battery current converter (PTAB), one PTAB current control unit (BUPT-1M), and three charge/discharge current integrators (MIRT-3).  Before connecting the new BUPT, TsUP turned off the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and VD-SU control mode.  BITS2-12 was later turned back on in order for ground checkout of the new current controller.]
 
Sergei Revin took the periodic documentary photographs of the running educational experiment OBR-1-2/Fizika-Obrazovaniye, currently featuring the “Physics-Phase” (FAZA) demo, initiated on 8/14.      [Obrazovaniye (Education) is a suite of three educational demonstrations of physics in micro-G, viz., OBR-1-1/”Fizika-LT” (Motion), OBR-1-2/”Fizika-Faza” (Phase) and OBR-1-3/”Fizika-Otolit”.  The current “FAZA” demo studies a complete gas-liquid phase separation of fine dispersion particles in micro-G with diffusion and surface tension of the fluid.  The experiment is conducted over 7-10 days, documented with photography once a day.]
 
Later, FE-2 collected the periodic (monthly) air samples for return to Earth, using a Russian AK-1M absorber in the SM for air, plus IPD-CO Draeger tubes, on a cartridge belt with a pump, to check the SM cabin air for CO (Carbon Monoxide).
 
Preparatory to the MBSU1 R&amp;R during tomorrow’s EVA, Joe Acaba today installed the SPDA (Secondary Power Distribution Assembly) jumper in the Lab (powered from the portside payload rack), which will transfer critical loads from MBSU1 to MBSU-4, following yesterday’s installation of the Lab truss contingency jumper cable (connected to the starboard payload rack power outlet).     [The SPDA jumper will be removed again on Friday and the truss contingency cable on Saturday.  For the latter’s installation &amp; de-installation, the ITCS (Internal Thermal Control System) Loop A, the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module) and some other loads have to be taken down temporarily.]
 
Acaba also retrieved a spare RPCM (Remote Power Controller Module) and tools for the upcoming replacement of the LA1B-A RPCM.
 
Revin &amp; Malenchenko completed another collection session each for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Sergei’s 7<sup>th</sup> time, Yuri’s 3<sup>rd</sup> time.       [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Malenchenko conducted the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS hatchways.    [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)–RO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)–RO, PkhO–DC1, PkhO–FGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO–FGB GA, and FGB GA–Node-1.]
 
Using the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter), Hoshide downlinked the video footage recorded by him &amp; Suni of the latest JAXA CM (Commercial Mission) activity on 8/27.  The camcorder was then stowed.
 
MPC was also employed by Suni to downlink the footage recorded from yesterday’s EPO (Education Program Operation) demo of radiation research for the new Exploration Design Challenge.
 
Yuri set up the hardware for the new Russian experiment TEKh-52 “Vizir” (Viewfinder) and activated it for a test run with subsequent data downlink and ground specialist tagup.      [For today’s tests, Yuri used easily identifiable earth targets for obtaining images which will then be processed by the ground for equipment alignment and precision characterization.  Vizir uses the SKPF-U hardware, a photo image coordinate reference system using ultrasound sensors, a NIKON D3X photo camera with SIGMA AF 600mm (f/4) for detailed photography, a NIKON D3X with AF300-800mm lens for general target views, and the RSK1 laptop with new software (Vers. 3.4), installed on 8/13.]
 
Williams performed the periodic maintenance of the ARED advanced resistive exercise machine of evacuating its cylinder flywheels to reestablish proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.
 
FE-5 also had a time slot/placeholder reserved each for making entries in their electronic Journals on the personal SSC.   [Required are three journaling sessions per week.]
 
Before Presleep, Acaba turns on the MPC and starts the Ku-band data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, Joe turns MPC routing off again.        [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
At ~5:20am, Akihiko Hoshide conducted the weekly JAXA crew conference via phone with staff at SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center) at Tsukuba, Japan.
 
At ~7:50am, Joe had his regular weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.  Aki &amp; Suni underwent their pre-EVA PMC checkups at 11:40am &amp; 2:30pm, resp. (audio), and CDR, FE-4 &amp; FE-2 conducted PECs (Private Exercise Conferences), Sergei at ~4:30am, Yuri at ~4:40am, Gennady at ~4:50am EDT (audio).
 
The crew worked out on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).      [FE-6 &amp; FE-5 are on the special experimental SPRINT protocol which diverts from the regular 2.5 hrs per day exercise regime and introduces special daily sessions involving resistive and aerobic (interval &amp; continuous) exercise, followed by a USND (Ultrasound) leg muscle self scan in COL.  No exercise is being timelined for Friday.  If any day is not completed, Suni &amp; Aki pick up where they left off, i.e., they would be finishing out the week with the last day of exercise on her off day.  Suni’s protocol for today had ARED/CEVIS, with EVA-18 and T2 (4 min, int.) for the next 2 days.  Aki’s protocol showed T2 (4 min, int.) and EVA-18 tomorrow.]
 
Before exercising on the ARED, Revin set up and checked out the G1 video camera for it to record his workout session on the machine, meeting the regular 30-day requirement for biomechanical evaluation of the on-orbit crewmembers, and evaluation of the hardware status.  Afterwards, Aki stowed the video footage.
 
Tasks listed for Revin, Malenchenko &amp; Padalka on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>More preparation &amp; downlinking of reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb), and
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>A detailed &amp; general view photo session with TEKh-52 Vizir of the flooding which occurred overnight on 8/21-22 at the Black Sea;   [the disaster zone includes the towns Novomikhalovsky, Lermontovo and Tenginka, the Shapsukho &amp; Nechepsukho river valleys and the adjacent mountain region.  Novomikhalovsky is located on the Tuapse-Novorossiisk Highway, 33 km from Tuapse and 14 km from Dzubgi. The town is situated in the Nechepsukho river valley and its tributary Psebe, where Nechepsukho is falling into Mikhalovsky Bay in the Black Sea. As a result of torrential rain the Nechepsukho River flooded.  600 houses, a hospital and a school were in the disaster zone. Four people died, 1500 were affected, including 275 children.  Municipal infrastructures need to be restored. Lermontovo is located on the shores of Tenginsky Bay of the Black Sea, at the inflow of Shapsukho River. The valley of that river is approx. 40 km in length, 5 km to the east of Dzubgi on the Tuapse-Novorosskiisk highway and 55 km from Tuapse. The Tenginka village is located 4 km upriver], and
<?if !supportLists?>·        <?endif?>A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.
