ISS On-Orbit Status 09/13/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.  Sunday --- off-duty day.  Ahead: Week 16 of Increment 20
 
  At wake-up, Bob Thirsk supported ongoing JAXA micro-G assessments by tapping a portside seat track in the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) several times with his fist to provide intentional excitation to the MMA.    [Bob’s sleep station is in the JPM.  Three sets of data measurement are planned in the current week 23 (9/11-9/15), each lasting 24 hours. The first set of data collection is scheduled today. The second set will be scheduled on 9/13 and the third one on 9/14.  Comparing the data between the U.S. SAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System) and MMA is important for ground analysis. Therefore, after begin of micro-G data measurement by SAMS and MMA, in order for the ground to accurately compare the data collection, Bob was to provide an intentional vibration near the JPM CQ (Crew Quarters).]
 
  Nicole Stott closed out the second day of her first session with the NASA/JSC experiment NUTRITION w/Repository, finishing 24-hr urine collections &amp; sample placing in MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Her next NUTRITION w/Repository activity is the FD30 session.    [The NUTRITION project is the most comprehensive in-flight study done by NASA to date of human physiologic changes during long-duration space flight.  It includes measures of bone metabolism, oxidative damage, nutritional assessments, and hormonal changes, expanding the previous Clinical Nutritional Assessment profile (MR016L) testing in three ways: Addition of in-flight blood &amp; urine collection (made possible by supercold MELFI dewars), normative markers of nutritional assessment, and a return session plus 30-day (R+30) session to allow evaluation of post-flight nutrition and implications for rehabilitation.]
 
  In the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), FE-4 Thirsk worked with FE-3 Romanenko in retrieving and taking the readings of eight RaDI-N SBDs (Radiation Dosimetry inside ISS / Space Bubble Detectors) set up on 9/6 for the second RaDI-N payload session (which measures neutron flux) near the TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter, for comparison).     [Since the SBDs are also part of the Russian RBO-3-2 Matryoshka payload, Roman provided his experience and help with their retrieval and placement in the Matryoshka Reader.  Measured dose rates for ~7 days were all below 100 mrem.  Note: TEPC was moved from COL to SM (Service Module) yesterday.]
 
  Romanenko performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM, including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.       [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Roman also checked up on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP-Moscow.
 
  All crewmembers had their weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Gennady at ~6:35am, Roman at ~8:10am, Frank at ~9:40am, Nicole at ~11:55am, Mike at ~1:30pm, Bob at ~3:25pm EDT.
 
  The crew performed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-4, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-2, FE-3), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-2, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (CDR).
