Crew-8 Port Relocation: Today, the Crew Dragon Endeavor was successfully relocated from Node 2 Forward to Node 2 Zenith. This relocation was completed in preparation for the arrival of the Boeing Starliner CFT mission, which is planned to launch on May 7th GMT and dock on May 8th GMT.
Payloads:
Metal-3D: The crew configured the appropriate switches and vent lines to support later Metal-3D science activities. Once science activities begin, Metal-3D will be used to attempt several prints using stainless steel as the print material. More information on this investigation can be found here.
Standard Measures: The crew completed pre-sleep questionnaires using the EveryWear app on their iPad.Â  More information on this investigation can be found here.
Window Observational Research Facility (WORF): The crew assisted with loading the Common Laptop Software (CLS) version 16 onto the WORF laptop. WORF provides a facility for Earth science remote sensing instruments using the Destiny science window in the U.S. Laboratory. The Destiny window has the highest quality optics ever flown on a human-occupied spacecraft.
Systems:
CFT Emergency Ammonia Hardware Relocate: The crew gathered and relocated an Ammonia Measurement Kit, Emergency Mask Stowage Bag, and two Ammonia Cartridge Bags from the RS to the Node 2 Forward Endcone. This was completed in preparation for the arrival of Boeing CFT to ensure the CFT crew has readily available access to the emergency equipment.
