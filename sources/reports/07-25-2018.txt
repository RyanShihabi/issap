Rodent Research-7 (RR-7):  Today the crew completed the second of two days of rodent operations for the RR-7 investigation today. Crewmembers performed bone densitometer scans, blood draws, fecal pellet collections, and sampling operations.  Following these operations, the crew performed clean-up activities in the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) to prepare the facility for upcoming science.  RR-7 examines how the space environment affects the community of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract of mice (also known as the microbiota). It also looks at microgravity’s effect on multiple physiological systems known to be effected by the microbiota, including the gastrointestinal, immune, metabolic, circadian, and sleep systems. These studies should help explain mechanisms underlying interactions between these systems and the role of the microbiota in these interactions.
Exposed Experiment Handrail Attachment Mechanism (ExHAM) #1 Robotics Operations:  Last night the robotic specialists in Tsukuba used the Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEMRMS) with the Small Fine Arm (SFA) to remove the Handhold Experiment Platform (HXP) from the JEM Airlock Slide Table and install it on the JEM Exposed Facility handrail.
