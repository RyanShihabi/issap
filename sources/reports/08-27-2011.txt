ISS On-Orbit Status 08/27/11 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. Saturday – Crew off-duty day. As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, CDR Borisenko performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution & Warning panel. The six crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).  As part of today’s Uborka, FE-5 Furukawa took documentary photographs of the RGSH AORG (Return Grid Sensor Housing add-on screens) at COL D0 before and after going over them with the vacuum cleaner (to be compared with pictures taken during previous cleaning to establish the quantity of debris captured during the week).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.] As part of the Uborka house cleaning, FE-1 Samokutyayev completed regular maintenance inspection & cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM, with documentary photography, and the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s & FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on its total operating time & “On” durations for reporting to TsUP-Moscow. FE-4 Volkov completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control & Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO & KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV & EDV on RP flow regulator.] At ~9:00am EDT, the crew held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events. Later today, FE-3 Garan supports MCC-Houston engineers in ground testing of the MPC (Multi-Protocol Converter) by downlinking a live HD camcorder video picture, leaving it on for ~2.5 hrs. Andrey Borisenko completed the daily routine inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse, checking for proper fan operation by testing the air flow from the ventilators BO A04 & BO A05 and verifying that both LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) are lit, then watering the root modules KM A32 & A24 to the roper humidity level.          [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]  For today’s VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activities, Satoshi Furukawa had selected JAXA EPO (Educational Program Operation) Reports, i.e., to write two short reports showing ordinary life in space which, it is expected, will attract children and the general public's attention for future human space exploration.           [JAXA EPO Report 07 is intended for the magazine THE NIKKEI WEEKLY-4, Report 08 for THE MAINICHI Newspapers-04.] At ~7:55am EDT, Andrey, Sasha & Sergei supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking messages of greetings and well-wishing to three events:  (1) To the participants of the “Star Blue Light” TV program & gala concert on 9/8, (2) to the participants of the 24th Planetary Congress in Moscow on 9/5-9/9, and (3) to TV-WISH for the town of Friazino on the occasion of its 60th anniversary.       [On 9/8, the Russian Space Federation along with the ASFP (Association of Space Flight Participants) is organizing an anniversary “Star Blue Light” TV-program dedicated to the 50th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin’s flight.  Cosmonauts, astronauts, managers & veterans of the Russian Space Industry, Business Community and Military will participate.-  The ASFP organizes annual Planetary Congresses which are conducted in the countries whose citizen flew in space.  This year, the Congress is held in Moscow, on 9/5-9/9 under the theme “He urged all of us to fly in space”.  This year around 120 astronauts & cosmonauts will take part in the Congress – and the sessions will take place in the main auditorium of the “Space” hotel, as well as Bauman Technical University and Moscow State University of Geodesic and Cartographic Studies. The participants of the Congress will be meeting with school children, college students, and general public.-  The city of Friazino near Moscow is celebrating its 60th anniversary in  2011.  On 12/29/2003, the President of Russia issued a presidential decree to grant Friazino the status of Science City.] The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation & stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-1, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4). Elektron Update:    The Russian Elektron O2 generator was successfully activated last Wednesday (8/24) in 32 amp mode and is running nominally.       [Elektron was scheduled to be down-moded after the departure of 3 crewmembers in 26S but that will probably change now]. PMA-2 Stowage Update:    By leaving the PMA-2 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 2) pressurized after the final Shuttle undocking, 27 CTBEs (Cargo Transfer Bag Equivalents) of available stowage space was gained for USOS cargo.   A total of 24 CTBEs worth of cargo were stored in the volume this week by Ron and Satoshi. Progress 44P Replanning:     Ground teams at MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow are busy replanning on-orbit operations after the loss of the Progress 44P resupply ship on 8/24.  Prime method for tracking consumables on board will be the new BCR/RFID (Bar Code Reader / Radio Frequency ID) scanner system (which is to be checked out first).  With a slip of Soyuz 26S departure next week very likely, work schedules are being redefined to make use of the additional US crewmember (Garan), the two Russian crew members (Borisenko, Samokutyayev) and activities planned originally for Increment 29.  SM propellant tanks are topped off right now from Progress 42P.  Prime reboost & DAM (Debris Avoidance Maneuver) would be done with SM main engines, but DC-1 could also be used.  Having the SM aft end open (no Progress docked) appears of no concern, except perhaps for a slight increase in MMOD (Micrometeorite/Orbital Debris) risk.
