ISS On-Orbit Status 12/12/10
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Sunday – Crew rest day.   Ahead: Week 3 of Increment 26.
 
FE-1 Kaleri conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Alex will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-2 Skripochka completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
FE-2 also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
CDR Kelly completed the regular bi-monthly reboots of the OCA Router &amp; FS SSC (File Server Station Support Computer) laptops (the latter required to mitigate the problem of iPV and OSTPV not opening up procedures due to a memory leak in the “Tomcat” software).  After a period of no less than 10 min later, the CDR also rebooted the two ISS network servers (SERVER1 &amp; 2).
 
While waiting for the SERVER reboots, Scott moved to the Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) to switch on the PROX (Proximity Communication System) to support JAXA ground ops.
 
CDR &amp; FE-2 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Oleg at ~9:10am, Scott at ~12:00pm EST.
 
Jobs listed for Kaleri &amp; Skripochka today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for general views of glaciers and icebergs at Prince Edward island, Crozet Island, Kerguelen Island, Herd Island, icebergs in the area of Bouvetøya island along the far most ice limit, and Patagonia Southern Ice Field Glaciers,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~15-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining NIKON D3 photos with Nikkor 80-200 mm lens and the SONY HD video camcorder on oceanic color bloom patterns in the waters of South-Eastern Pacific., then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,</li></ul> 
Scott Kelly’s discretionary “job jar” task list for today called for –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">The periodic R&amp;R (removal &amp; replacement) of the EDV-U container in the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">The periodic ISS Ops Product Survey by US crews.    [This evaluation should help MCC-Houston/MOD and the entire ISS Ops community across all IPs (International Partners) to better integrate the ops products used onboard on a daily basis (such as the Daily Summary, Stowage Notes, and Procedures).  The standards described in the survey are not NASA-only but are also supposed to be followed by all USOS control centers (Houston, POIC, COL-CC, and SSIPC).]</li></ul> 
The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-2), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR), and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
 
Bone Calcium Loss:   Tonight Scott Kelly starts the overnight fast for another dosing with the Bisphosphonates Alendronate pill protocol tomorrow morning.     [Only plain water is allowed for ~10 hrs prior to dosing.  The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.]
