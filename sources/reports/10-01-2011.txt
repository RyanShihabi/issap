ISS On-Orbit Status 10/01/11
<h1>All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Saturday – Crew off duty.</h1><h1 style="margin-left:.5in">Today 53 years ago (1958) NASA became operational after its establishment by the National Aeronautics and Space Act on July 29, 1958, replacing its predecessor, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics).</h1>FE-4 Sergei Volkov performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
Also during the morning Inspection, the CDR conducted the routine checkup of the circuit breakers &amp; fuses in the DC1 Docking Compartment.      [The monthly checkup in DC1, MRM1 &amp; MRM2 looks at AZS circuit breakers on the BVP Amp Switch Panel (they should all be On) and the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) of 14 fuses in fuse panels BPP-30 &amp; BPP-36.  MRM2 &amp; MRM1 were derived from the DC1 concept and are very similar to it.]
 
CDR Fossum serviced the running BCAT-5 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-5) experiment, checking camera operations during the day and changing the camera battery in the morning and before sleeptime (change required after 8 hrs).  As of yesterday, the BCAT camera flash has issues.  The pictures are not useful and will need to be repeated.  A cable needs to be found and a diagnosis of the camera problems completed.        [The new experiment session is with a Harvard University phase separation sample using a different setup than for the recent crystal samples 9 &amp; 10, mainly requiring an SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop with EarthKAM timing software, power cables and camera USB cable.  For illumination, the Mini-MagLite and Flash batteries do not need to be changed yet, but the camera will need a freshly charged battery.  After Mike started the run on 9/21 by mixing the sample (#4) for phase separation and taking test photos, the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) software on the SSC-13 laptop began taking pictures of Sample 4 for 13 days at different intervals throughout the run.  This requires camera battery changes twice a day and image check with a battery change once per day.  BCAT-5 is operating in the JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) because some time ago the crew deemed the US Lab too crowded for running it.]
 
Fossum, Volkov &amp; Furukawa joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).        ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of Uborka house cleaning, Volkov completed regular weekly maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles in the SM (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) and the BMP Harmful Contaminants Removal System grille in the SM.  Before the cleaning, all fan screens were photographed for ground inspection.
 
FE-5 Furukawa turned on MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) routing and started the playback to the ground of stored video from yesterday’s JAXA EPO (Educational Payload Operation), i.e., the LEGO Bricks Trundle Wheel demo, shutting MPC routing down about 2 hrs later.
 
Also for the JAXA EPO program, Satoshi prepared Report Nr. 11, i.e., writing another short report showing ordinary life in space which, as is expected, will attract children and the general public's attention for future human space exploration.       [JAXA EPO Report 11 is intended for the THE NIKKEI-06 issue, with the topic ("Natural phenomenon").]
 
In the ESA COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Furukawa affixed updated labels at the fireports of an HRF (Human Research Facility) power converter and of the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device) payload.
 
Sergei performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.        [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
After ground-commanded overnight MDCA (Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus) payload test operations on the CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) in the Lab (at S3), Mike Fossum installed the three PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) lock-down alignment guides on the rack to protect its ARIS (Active Rack Isolation System) from external loading (dynamic disturbances).
 
At ~6:10am EDT, Sergei Volkov had his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
At ~8:25am EDT, the three crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
At ~8:55am, Fossum &amp; Furukawa conducted a teleconference with MCC-H “PLUTO” flight controllers to discuss the upcoming R&amp;R (Remove &amp; Replace) of the ISL (Integrated Station LAN) network router in Node-2, scheduled on Monday (10/3) for Satoshi.        [Preparations are being made on SSC (Station Support Computer) laptops 7, 12 &amp; 15 to ensure that the crew continues to have the necessary ops products during the activities for the day.  The  Node-2 activities will involve physical R&amp;R of the ISL Router, relocation of SSC-9 &amp; SSC-11 to Node-2 for ISL Router configuration, connecting SSC-9 &amp; SSC-11 by Satoshi, configuring the new ISL Router by ground controllers, disconnecting the two SSC laptops and returning them to their nominal locations, again by FE-5.]
 
Tasks listed for Sergei Volkov on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Continuing the preparation &amp; downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens, aiming for the volcanoes Popocatepetl, Huascaran and Cordon-Kaul, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Another ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop.</li></ul> 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-4, FE-5) and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5).
