United States On-orbit Segment (USOS) Crew Day Off / SpaceX Unberth Delay:  Today was a USOS Crew day off, resulting from a delay to unberth SpaceX-4 Dragon.  Due to forecasts of high seas at the time of splashdown, SpaceX-4 unberth and landing has been delayed until this coming Saturday, October 25th.  Dragon loading and hatch closure activities are being replanned to support the new unberth date.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations:  Robotic Flight Controllers powered up the MSS and utilized the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) in order to grapple the Dragon Flight Releasable Grapple Fixture (FRGF).  Today’s SSRMS maneuver was performed in preparation for Saturday’s Dragon unberth and release.  MSS performance was nominal.
