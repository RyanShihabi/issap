Post-EVA Operations: Flight Engineer (FE)-5 Mastracchio and FE-3 Hopkins performed nominal post-EVA maintenance on the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) suits.  In addition, samples from the Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garments (LCVG) were transferred into bags to be returned to the ground for analysis.  These samples will support the EMU 3011 water in the vent loop root cause investigation.  The EMU water tanks were refilled and the cooling loops were scrubbed for EMUs 3005, 3011, 3010 and 3015.
External Thermal Control System (ETCS) Loop A Re-integration Status:  All of the Interface Heat Exchangers (IFHXs) were reintegrated onto Loop A yesterday and heat rejection capability has been restored.
RS EVA 37 Preparations: Preparations continue nominally for the RS EVA.  Today, the crew closed the hatches to 53P.  The hatches to 52P were closed last Sunday.  All of the US EVA equipment that will be used during the RS EVA 37 were transferred to the Russian crew yesterday and today.  RS EVA 37 is scheduled for tomorrow, December 27th.
Mobile Servicing System (MSS) Operations: The Robotics Ground Controllers restored the MSS to a nominal power configuration after restoration of ETCS Loop A.  They also reduced the rigidization load in the Payload/ORU Accommodation (POA) carriage.  This load reduction will mitigate long-term wear on the POA snare cables while it’s holding the failed Pump Module (PM).
