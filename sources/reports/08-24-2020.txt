ISS HAM: The crew participated in an ISS HAM contact with Information and Technologies Branch, Department of Education-Queensland Government, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.  Some of the questions asked included if the crew ever has any arguments, what it’s like to go on a spacewalk for the first time, and what brought Chris Cassidy from being a Navy SEAL to NASA and spaceflight.  ISS Ham Radio provides opportunities to engage and educate students, teachers, parents and other members of the community in science, technology, engineering and math by providing a means to communicate between astronauts and the ground HAM radio units.

USOS Isolation Operations: The crew remained isolated in the Russian Segment (SM/ MRM2/ Soyuz/ Progress) today. The crew closed several module hatches on GMT 234 to allow the ground team to monitor pressures throughout the weekend. The IMMT opted to extend the leak isolation period to Tuesday morning. Items deferred on today’s timeline will be performed tomorrow after the morning daily planning conference (mDPC). The Environmental Control and Life Support (ECLS) community has been tracking an increase in nominal atmosphere leakage since October 2019. The motivation for finding the leak is to reduce the amount of consumables required to maintain the ISS pressure.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Glove Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment (TMG) Repair & Replace (R&R) Developmental Test Objective (DTO): Today the crew performed an R&R of the EMU glove by removing the TMG in the glove and installing a new one. The DTO is part of an effort to determine whether a glove TMG should be R&R’ed on-orbit. Since TMG damage during EVAs is the most common reason gloves are declared no-go, successful completion will save on mass, cost, glove processing, and logistics. A post-flight inspection/verification will be performed following today’s on-orbit R&R.
