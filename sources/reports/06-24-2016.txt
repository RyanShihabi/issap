Multi-Omics: The crew checked the remaining Fructooligosaccharide (FOS) packages and stowed the Fructooligo Bag for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Multi-Omics investigation. The Multi-Omics analysis of human microbial-metabolic cross-talk in the space ecosystem evaluates the impacts of space environment and prebiotics on astronauts’ immune function by combining the data obtained from the measurements of changes in the gut microbiological composition, metabolites profiles, and the immune system.
Expedite the Processing of Experiments to Space Station (EXPRESS) Rack-3 Laptop Computer (ELC) Operations: The EXPRESS Laptop Release 10 disk was removed from the EXPRESS Rack-3 Laptop and installed in the EXPRESS Rack-5 Laptop in preparation for upcoming European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) maintenance activities.
Packed Bed Reactor Experiment (PBRE) Hardware Stow: Following completion of 4 weeks of PBRE operations, the crew spent the majority of his day de-configuring and stowing the PBRE hardware. The PBRE was used to study the behavior of gases and liquids when they flow simultaneously through a column filled with fixed porous media. The porous media or “packing” can be made of different shapes and materials and are used widely in chemical engineering as a means to enhance the contact between two immiscible fluid phases (e.g., liquid-gas, water-oil, etc.). Packed columns can serve as reactors, scrubbers, strippers, etc. in systems where efficient interphase contact is desired, both on Earth and in space. The next operations are planned for this December. 
ISS Maneuver to Solar Attitude: Yesterday the ISS performed a CMG attitude maneuver to a slightly biased attitude that allows the Solar payload on Columbus to maintain visibility of the sun.  ISS will stay in the Solar attitude until June 27.
