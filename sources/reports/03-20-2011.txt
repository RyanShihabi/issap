ISS On-Orbit Status 03/20/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Sunday –  Ahead:  Week 2 of Increment 27.
 
Upon wake-up, CDR Kondratyev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
Later, Dmitri conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.     [This includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
The CDR also performed the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
In Node-3, FE-6 Coleman configured the WRS2 (Water Recovery System 2) setup to the condensate collection tank at Lab bay D5 in preparation for WPA (Water Processor Assembly) maintenance scheduled for Tuesday, 3/22, with preparatory activities by Cady and the ground tomorrow.     [The WRS2 waste water connection and Lab D5 connection share the same cap.]
 
For his chosen Voluntary Weekend Science project today, FE-5 Nespoli retrieved the ESA ERB-2 (Erasmus Recording Binocular 2) from the EDR (European Drawer Rack) in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), inserted the freshly charged batteries and conducted the planned Fly-Through Filming program, starting in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and proceeding through Node-2, US Lab, Node-3 with Cupola to COL.  ERB-2 was then reconnected to EDR on a multi-use bracket.      [ERB-2 is a stereoscopic (three-dimensional) video camera for taking imagery of the environment onboard the ISS to create an accurate map of its interior including views of the Earth as seen through the windows and some of the crew’s daily environment.  ERB-2 is the second generation of the stereoscopic camera family from the Erasmus Centre at ESTEC which started with the ERB. ERB-2 has an improved resolution of 1280 x 720 pixel (HD 720p), thereby achieving a compatible resolution with current commercial HDTV standards.  With the ability to perform live broadcast of stereo films and to downlink files of recorded video sessions using the station’s HRDL (High Rate Data Link) via the EDR, ERB-2 takes advantage of high-definition optics and advanced electronics to provide a vastly improved 3D video effect for mapping the Station. The almost-like-real 3D images from ERB-2 take the viewers inside the ISS as if they were really there.  These images can also be used in mission planning and to support operations inside the Station.  Today’s activity should have produced about 30 minutes of footage in total.  Care is taken not to film private (such as medical), personal, proprietary or otherwise embargoed items or info.]
 
Kondratyev had ~15 min to transfer his latest video recording to SSC (Station Support Computer) laptop for downlinking to TsUP-Moscow.      [Dmitri Kondratyev’s Videoblog project, recorded by Dima at his convenience, began on 1/8, with frequent downlinks via OCA (not to exceed 300 Mb),] 
 
The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-6), TVIS treadmill (CDR), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (FE-5).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
Jobs listed for Kondratyev today on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list were –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another ~30-min. run of the GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with the NIKON D3X digital camera photography with Sigma AF 300-800mm telelens   [uplinked targets included Lipetsk, Yuri Gagarin’s landing site (45.99 E, 51.26 N), Aral Sea, Novorossiysk, the Laganakskoe Plateau, Krasnaya Polyana, the Volga River delta, and the Etna volcano,]</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for Russia's EKON Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X camera with the RSK-1 laptop, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~15-min. photography session for the DZZ-13 “Seiner” ocean observation program, obtaining NIKON D3 photos with Nikkor 80-200 mm lens and the SONY HD video camcorder on oceanic color bloom patterns in the waters of Central Eastern Atlantic, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop,</li></ul> 
No CEO  (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
