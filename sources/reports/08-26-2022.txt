AstroPi: The AstroPi photography checkout activity was continued with the removal of the 6 mm camera lens and the installation of the 12 mm camera lens. In this checkout, ground teams are assessing night-time photography capabilities of the AstroPi system with both lenses. Two augmented Raspberry Pi computers (called AstroPis) were flown to the ISS and are both equipped with the mighty Sense Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) which measures the environment inside the ISS, detects how the station moves through space, and picks up the Earth’s magnetic field. Each AstroPi is also equipped with different types of cameras: one has an infrared (IR) camera, and the other has a standard visible spectrum camera.
Systems:
Space Station Computer (SSC) Swap: Today, the crew moved SSC 12 from Dragon to LAB and moved SSC 20 from LAB to Dragon. SSCs are swapped regularly to ensure that International Procedures Viewer (IPV) backups are applied to SSCs remaining in Dragon for emergency situations. SSCs are laptops associated with non-command activities onboard the ISS. 
EVA Battery Operations Terminal Charge Initiation: The crew initiated a charge of the Lithium-Ion Battery using the EVA Battery Operations Terminal. The Rechargeable EVA Battery Assembly (REBA) Lithium-Ion Batteries are being recharged for use during Russian EVA 54A.
