ISS On-Orbit Status 10/01/09
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Off-duty day for the crew and shifted work/sleep cycle to accommodate the Soyuz 20S arrival:  Wakeup – 2:00am this morning, sleep – 4:30pm (one hour earlier).  Next wakeup – 1:00am EDT.  Soyuz docking: ~4:37am EDT.
 
 Soyuz TMA-16 (20S), with ISS-21 FE-1 Maxim Suraev, ISS-21 FE-3 Jeff Williams &amp; SFP/VC-17 Guy Laliberté, continues to catch up with the ISS for the docking tomorrow morning at ~4:37am EDT at the SM aft port.  All systems are nominal.  (Flight plan, see below).
 
 FE-5 Frank De Winne is on Day 5 of Session 2 of the SOLO (Sodium Loading in Microgravity) experiment, i.e., last day of the high-salt diet block.  Besides the daily diet monitoring/logging, today’s activities also involved taking measurements of body mass (BMM) with the SLAMMD (Space Linear Acceleration Mass Measurement Device).     [SOLO runs in two blocks of six days each.  During the Session 1 block, FE-5 followed a special low-salt diet, during the current Session 2 a high-salt diet.  For both diets, specially prepared meals are provided onboard.  All three daily meals are logged on sheets stowed in the PCBA Consumable Kit in the MELFI along with control solution and cartridges for the PCBA.  SOLO, an ESA/German experiment from the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine in Cologne/Germany, investigates the mechanisms of fluid and salt retention in the body during long-duration space flight.   Background:  The hypothesis of an increased urine flow as the main cause for body mass decrease has been questioned in several recently flown missions.  Data from the US SLS1/2 missions as well as the European/Russian Euromir `94 &amp; MIR 97 missions show that urine flow and total body fluid remain unchanged when isocaloric energy intake is achieved.  However, in two astronauts during these missions the renin-angiotensin system was considerably activated while plasma ANP concentrations were decreased.  Calculation of daily sodium balances during a 15-day experiment of the MIR 97 mission (by subtracting sodium excretion from sodium intake) showed an astonishing result: the astronaut retained on average 50 mmol sodium daily in space compared to balanced sodium in the control experiment.]
 
 The SLAMMD hardware was also used today by FE-1 Barratt, FE-2 Stott &amp; FE-4 Thirsk for their own BMM (Body Mass Measurement).  Afterwards, Bob powered off, dismantled and stowed the SLAMMD hardware.     [SLAMMD, performed first on Expedition 12 in December 2005, provides an accurate means of determining the on-orbit mass of humans spanning the range from the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile Japanese female to the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile American male.  The procedure, in accordance with Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Law of Motion, finds the mass by dividing force, generated by two springs inside the SLAMMD drawer, by acceleration measured with a precise optical instrument that detects the position versus time trajectory of the SLAMMD guide arm and a micro controller which collects the raw data and provides the precise timing.  The final computation is done via portable laptop computer with SLAMMD unique software.  To calculate their mass, crewmembers wrap their legs around a leg support assembly, align the stomach against a belly pad and either rest the head or chin on a head rest.  For calibration, an 18-lbs. mass is used at different lengths from the pivot point, to simulate different mass values.  Crew mass range is from 90 to 240 lbs.]
 
 Mike Barratt charged video camcorder batteries for tomorrow’s scheduled “Foam Stability” experiment.   [A total of 8 camcorder batteries were charged, two at a time, in the dual Canon Lithium-Ion Battery Charger.] 
 
 Later, the FE-1 terminated his third (&amp; last) session with the JAXA experiment “Biological Rhythms” after completing the 24-hr. run, doffing the electrodes of the DWH (Digital Walk Holter) for ECG (Electrocardiogram) recording, then saving the Holter ECG data on the MLT (MMA {Microgravity Measurement Apparatus} Laptop Terminal).
 
 FE-2 Stott retrieved &amp; stowed the four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies deployed by Bob Thirsk on 9/29 in the Lab (at P3, below CEVIS) and SM (Service Module, at the most forward handrail, on panel 307), to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.    [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow.]
 
 CDR Padalka &amp; FE-3 Romanenko continued the checkout of the Russian “Istochnik-M” (source, spring) telemetry reception &amp; recording (SPR TMI) system in the SM (Service Module), which enables the ISS to receive telemetry from Soyuz spacecraft and record it on the Istochnik-M telemetry system.    [Today, the BR-9TsU telemetry system on the Soyuz TMA-14/18S was turned on, and the FSH3 spectrum analyzer was used to measure the input signal from the SM antenna.  The equipment, including the Istochnik TM station, power amplifiers, power supply, USB software sticks and cables, will capture Soyuz data through the amateur (ham) radio antenna, and transfer it to a laptop display where the crew will be able to immediately tell if a good separation of modules occurred during Soyuz 18S descent operations].
 
 The FE-3 removed the BNP Portable Repress Tank (#15) from the DC1 Docking Compartment in preparation of its relocation to the Soyuz TMA-16/20P Orbital Module after its docking.
 
 In Node-2, FE-4 Thirsk supported troubleshooting of a failed GLA RPC 6 (General Luminaire Assembly / Remote Power Controller 6) by observing ground-commanded attempts to close the open RPC.
 
 Afterwards, Bob performed Part 2 of the regular USOS (US Orbital Segment) hatch seal inspection started yesterday, using<a name="OLE_LINK54"></a> the vacuum cleaner/brush plus other tools on the hatches at Node 2 (Aft, Port &amp; Forward), Node 2 (Starboard &amp; Port), COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory, Port), JPM (JEM Pressurized Module, Starboard &amp; Zenith), and JLP (JEM Logistics Pressurized Segment, Nadir).
 
 FE-5 De Winne completed the periodic (once monthly) reboot of all active US PCS (Portable Computer System), recording battery state of charge, and also shut down the JPM, COL and HTV (H-II Transfer Vehicle) PCS laptops.
 
 Nicole Stott connected the two Readers of the LOCAD-PTS (Lab-on-a-Chip Application Development-Portable Test System) payload one at a time to the MLC (Microgravity Science Glovebox Laptop) via RS-232 data cable, turned on the MLC and downlinked the Reader-stored data to the ground.    [After the ground confirmed receipt of the data, the data on each Reader were erased.]
 
 The FE-2 also completed the weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week.      [The current card (20-0055T) lists 79 CWCs (~1,883.3 L total) for the four types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (66 CWCs with 1,497.9 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 285.0 L for flushing only due to Wautersia bacteria &amp; 176.2 L in 4 clean bags for contingency use, 2. potable water (8 CWCs with 323.1 L, of which 194.8 L (5 bags) are currently off-limit pending ground analysis results), the remainder good for contingency use, 3. condensate water (3 CWCs with 5 L), 4. waste/EMU dump and other (2 CWCs with 57.3 L).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
 In the COL, Frank De Winne removed all 8 ECs (Experiment Containers) from Rotor A &amp; B of the experiment WAICO (Waving &amp; Coiling of Arabidopsis Roots at Different g-levels) in the BLB (Biolab).
 
 Mike Barratt accessed the WRS2 (Water Recovery System 2) for the periodic backfill of the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) with the QD (Quick Disconnect) hose, which was then stowed and the RFTA activity closed out.
 
 At ~10:10am, Frank will powered up the SM's amateur radio equipment (Kenwood VHF transceiver with manual frequency selection, headset, &amp; power supply) and at ~10:15am conducted a ham radio session with students at the Pavilhão do Conhecimento of the Ciência Viva School in Lisbon, Portugal.
 
 At ~2:10pm, the ISS crew is scheduled for their regular weekly tagup with the Lead Flight Director at JSC/MCC-H via S-band/audio.    [S/G-2 (Space-to-Ground 2) phone patch via SSC (Station Support Computer).]
 
 The FE-3 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-1, FE-4), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1, FE-2, FE-4, FE-5), and VELO cycle ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-3).    [ARED is showing lower loads than expected.  The exerciser is still functional, and engineers will determine if there is a good seal on the force cylinder so that the expected loading can be obtained.]
 
 Later, Thirsk transferred the exercise data files to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
 Before exercising on the TVIS treadmill, Nicole Stott instrumented her treadmill harness with data collection transducers in support of an SDTO (Station Development Test Objective), then activated the hardware for the exercise run.  Afterwards, Nicole downloaded the harness data and filled out a survey questionnaire to complete the SDTO.    [This activity was also performed yesterday by Bob Thirsk.]

 CEO (Crew Earth Observation) photo targets uplinked for today were St. Paul Rocks islets, Brazil (Beagle Site. This group of small islands and rocks is also known as the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago.  The islands are of particular interest to geologists as they expose rocks associated with the Earth's mantle above sea level.  Looking to the left of track for the islands – the crew should have been able to photograph all of them in a mapping pass), Tenoumer Impact Crater, Mauritania (weather was expected to be clear over the Tenoumer impact crater.  Looking slightly to the right of track for the crater; it is located between two large linear dune fields, and appears as a well-defined ring of outcrops against the surrounding desert), and Lake Travis, TX (Lake Travis is the longest [97 km] of the seven Highland Lakes on the Colorado River in central Texas.  Looking to the left of track for the Lake, which is located immediately to the northwest of Austin, TX.  Overlapping frames of the Lake and its shorelines were requested).
 
 CEO photography can be studied at this “Gateway” website:
 <a href="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov">http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov</a> (as of 9/1/08, this database contained 770,668 views of the Earth from space, with 324,812 from the ISS alone).
