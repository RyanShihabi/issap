ISS On-Orbit Status 04/14/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   FD10 (Flight Day 10) of STS-131/19A. Crew sleep shifting in effect – see below.     &gt;&gt;&gt;Today 29 years ago, STS-1/Columbia, the first orbital Space Shuttle flight, returned to Earth, crewed by John Young and Bob Crippen.&lt;&lt;&lt;
 
 At wake-up (11:21pm last night), FE-6 Creamer &amp; FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson continued their current week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s fourth, Tracy’s first, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor his/her sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmember wears a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Creamer also completed another session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is performed twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  FE-1 Skvortsov terminated battery charging for the KPT-2 Kelvin-video and started the process on the battery of the TTM-2 experiment.
 
 Later, Skvortsov &amp; CDR Kotov used the KPT-2 payload for a 2.5-hr session with the Russian BAR experiment (#23/24), taking background environmental parameters in the RS (Russian Segment) in areas sampled on 3/4 by Oleg and found to have high microflora growth indications on the surface of the pressurized shell.  CDR used the AU-1 Ultrasound Analyzer, UT2-03 Leak Indicator and Iva-6A Thermal Hygrometer to identify potential condensation areas.  Afterwards, data were downloaded to the RSE1 laptop, log tables filled out for OCA downlink and the equipment restowed.  FE-3 Kornienko later initiated recharge on the Kelvin battery before sleeptime.      [The Iva-6A, TTM-2 and Kelvin-Video probes took air &amp; dew point temperatures in SM PkhO (Service Module Transfer Compartment) sampling areas and behind Panels 217 &amp; 218.  Objective of the Russian KPT-12/EXPERT science payload is to measure environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, air flow rate) and module shell surface temperatures behind SM panels and other areas susceptible to possible micro-destruction (corrosion), before and after insolation (day vs. night).  The payload uses a remote infrared thermometer (Kelvin-Video), a thermohygrometer (Iva-6A), a heat-loss thermoanemometer/thermometer (TTM-2) and an ultrasound analyzer (AU) to determine environmental data in specific locations and at specific times.  Activities include documentary photography with the NIKON D2X camera and flash.]
 
 Oleg Kotov set up pumping equipment and initiated water transfer from the BV1 Rodnik storage tank of Progress M-04M/36P to the SM, then terminated the transfer and started the usual bladder compression and leak check to get it ready for urine transfer.  36P is docked at the SM aft end.    [Each of the spherical Rodnik tanks BV1 &amp; BV2 consists of a hard shell with a soft membrane (bladder) composed of elastic fluoroplastic.  The bladder is used to expel water from the tank by compressed air pumped into the tank volume surrounding the membrane and is leak-tested before urine transfers, i.e., with empty tanks, the bladders are expanded against the tank walls and checked for hermeticity.]
 
 FE-2 Caldwell-Dyson again transferred the VCA-1 (Video Camera Assembly 1) camcorder from the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) to the Node-2, mounting it on the zenith “ceiling” for monitoring stowage &amp; closeout activities in the MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module)/Node-2 area.   [Afterwards, Tracy returned it to the COL at the end of the crew day and installed on its seat track at the Port Endcone, aft side.]
 
 Later, the FE-2 undertook the periodic (monthly) deployment of four passive FMK (Formaldehyde Monitoring Kit) sampling assemblies in the Lab (at bay P3, below CEVIS) and SM (at the most forward handrail, on panel 307) for two days, to catch any atmospheric formaldehyde on a collector substrate for subsequent analysis on the ground.     [Two monitors each are usually attached side by side, preferably in an orientation with their faces perpendicular to the direction of air flow].
 
 Working with FE-6 Creamer &amp; MS1 Mastracchio, Tracy restowed EVA tools used during the three recent spacewalks by Rick &amp; Clay Anderson.    [The crew has been made aware that there may be a fourth EVA before Shuttle undocking if needed for fixing the current problem with the NTA GPRV (Nitrogen Tank Assembly Gas Pressure Regulating Valve) at the new S1 ATA (Ammonia Tank Assembly.  (See below and yesterday’s ISS On-Orbit Status).]
 
 Afterwards, Tracy set up the US SLM (Sound Level Measurement) instrument and tool measurements of the noise level in the MPLM Leonardo, starting at ~9:00am EDT, then transferred the acoustic data for downlink to the ground.
 
 Working in Node-3 on the WRS-2 (Water Recovery System) Rack 2, FE-5 Noguchi performed the planned changeout of the RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly).  The old RFTA will be returned to Earth.     .    [When finished, the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) RFTA depress hose was installed between the FCPA (Fluids Control Pump Assembly) and RFTA in such a way that the RFTA could be back-filled while bypassing the internal filters.]
 
 In preparation for tomorrow’s MPLM unberthing, Soichi installed the CBM CPA (Common Berthing Mechanism Controller Panel Assembly) at the Node-2 nadir port.    [This is required so MCC-Houston can perform Node-2 nadir CBM preps for demate tonight during crew sleep.}
 
 Soichi also retrieved the Ziploc bags with samples of the JAXA NANOSKELETON experiment from MELFI 1 (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS 1, Dewar 1, Tray B, Section 1-2), wrapped them in a bag and attached it at the front panel of the MELFI rack for warming up to ambient temperature, before stowage for return to Earth.    [NANOSKELETON is one of the micro-G experiments conducted by JAXA for industrial application.  In the experiment, the TiO<sub>2</sub> (titanium oxide) “nanoskeleton” is synthesized with a mixture of CTAB surfactant solution and TiOSO<sub>4</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution under isothermal conditions (40 degC), to quantitatively investigate the effects of gravity during a chemical reaction process.  The experiment uses oil (TMB) to enlarge the pore size of the honeycomb structure; therefore, this experiment will attempt to clarify the effects of gravity such as the flotation of oil and convective flow, by evaluating the retrieved samples.  Experiment output on orbit consists of the temperature samples plus images.]
 
 In preparation for the new JAXA experiment MYCO (Mycological Evaluation of Crew Exposure to ISS Ambient Air), Soichi Noguchi distributed drinking water (100 mL) from PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) to participating crewmembers (FE-6 Creamer, PLT Dutton, MS1 Mastracchio, MS4 Yamazaki &amp; himself) along with a MYCO Kit for use first thing tomorrow morning, then reviewed procedural requirements with the crew.     [MYCO evaluates the risk of microorganisms via inhalation and adhesion to the skin to determine which fungi act as allergens on the ISS.  MYCO samples are to be collected from the nasal cavity, the pharynx and the skin of crew during preflight, in flight and postflight focusing particularly on fungi which act as strong allergens in our living environment.  Before sample collection, crewmembers are not to eat or drink anything except water, nor wash their face, brush their teeth, or gargle after you wake up to avoid science loss.]
 
 Timothy Creamer worked on the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), integrating the EDV-U urine container put aside yesterday by Noguchi with the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly).
 
 Later, TJ “scavenged” the last four GLA (General Luminaire Assembly) lighting fixtures (#0375, #0373, #0374, #0377) from the MPLM, to be used as spares on ISS.
 
 FE-6 also conducted the periodic status checks and necessary maintenance of the CGBA-5 (Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 5) payload.
 
 Alex did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Misha completed the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 The three Russian station residents, Alex, Misha &amp; Oleg, joined up for another 1-hr crew handover period in the RS (Russian Segment).
 
 Skvortsov, Kornienko &amp; Caldwell-Dyson again had free time to themselves for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
 At ~7:06am EDT, the 13 ISS/Shuttle occupants joined for the customary crew photo.
 
 At ~7:26am, the Exp-23 &amp; STS-131 crewmembers held the traditional Joint Crew News Conference with U.S. media (~16 min.), Russian media in Moscow (10 min.) and Japanese media in Tokyo (10 min.).    [No Europeans on board.]
 
 At ~1:55pm, TJ Creamer had his periodic PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Oleg at ~11:11am, Misha at ~11:46am, Alex at ~12:31pm, Tracy at ~12:46pm EDT.
 
 The crew completed today’s physical workout regime on the CEVIS cycle ergometer (FE-6), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-1, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-2, FE-3, FE-5) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-1, FE-3).  
 
 Tracy Caldwell-Dyson set up the video equipment to cover her workouts on the T2 &amp; ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) machines for real-time (live) biomechanical evaluation by ground specialists, and later tore it down for stowage.
 
 Mission 19A Extension:   Due to the failure of the NTA GPRV (Nitrogen Tank Assembly Gas Pressure Regulating Valve), which is essential to proper ETCS Loop A (External Thermal Control System) function, an extension of the 19A docked period by one day is being considered, to allow an additional spacewalk by the Shuttle crew rather than a later Stage EVA by ISS crew (STS-132/UL4 EVAs are full of non-deferrable content).  GPRV troubleshooting continues, but if there is no joy, the EVA might be conducted either on 4/17 (Saturday), yet to be decided on.  There is an NTA spare on the ESP-3 (External Stowage Platform-3) on the S3 zenith outboard PAS (Payload Attach System), outboard face, nadir position.   Background: Ground teams are unable to open the NTA GPRV, which is integral with the new ATA.  The NTA supplies pressure to the ATA, which in turn feeds the ETCS Loop A.  Loop A is currently isolated from the ATA and is operating nominally.  Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is supplied to the ETCS via the ATA when there are volume changes (voids) in the system due to varying thermal conditions.
