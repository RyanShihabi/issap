Resist Tubule: Commander (CDR) Swanson retrieved the Resist Tubule Measurement Experiment Unit B from inside the Cell Biology Experiment Facility (CBEF) micro-gravity Incubator Unit (IU) and inserted the samples into the Clean Bench (CB) microscope for observation. Resist Tubule clarifies the mechanisms of gravity resistance. Gravity resistance is a principal gravity response in plants, and plays an important role in the transition of plant ancestors from an aquatic environment to a terrestrial environment (about 450 million years ago), and in the consequent establishment of land plants. This present study clarifies the mechanisms of gravity resistance, in particular the processes from signal transformation and transduction, to response.
Materials Science Laboratory (MSL) Sample Cartridge Assembly (SCA) Exchange: Swanson installed a new cartridge for the Solidification along an Eutectic Path in Ternary Alloys (SETA) experiment. Ground teams will process the sample via ground commanding. SETA will study the effect of different processing velocities on the microstructure evolution; the influence of elimination of gravity component on the force balance and the influence and behavior of foreign particles added to the alloy.
Very High Frequency (VHF) Emergency Communication Checkout: Today Swanson conducted a successful VHF comm check through Dryden.  The comm check through White Sands was not successful due to a low elevation angle.
Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS) Operations for Camera/Light/PTU Assembly (CLPA) Remove and Replace R&R: Ground controllers continue preparations for the CLPA R&R operations. Today, the Robot Micro Conical Tool (RMCT) was taken out of its holster and the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) was unstowed. Tomorrow, ground controllers will use the SPDM to remove the SSRMS Boom CLPA and install it in the Mobile Berthing System (MBS) Mast.  Next week, a new CLPA will be installed in the SSRMS Boom location.
