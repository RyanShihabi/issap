ISS On-Orbit Status 04/08/09
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below. 
 
 Yest posadka!  (We have Landing!)   Welcome back home, Michael Fincke, Yuri Lonchakov and Charles Simonyi!  After 178 days 14 min in space (176 docked to ISS), Soyuz TMA-13/17S, carrying two-thirds of the Expedition 18 crew plus the US SFP, landed successfully this morning at ~3:15am EDT in the steppes of southern Kazakhstan, with the crew in excellent condition.  [The 17S undocking sequence was initiated on 4/7 with the command to open the Soyuz hooks at 11:52pm EDT. 17S separated from the ISS FGB nadir port at 11:55pm using the docking system springs.  Three minutes after initial separation an automatic separation burn was performed by the Soyuz spacecraft.  A 4 min 21 sec de-orbit burn was initiated this morning at 2:24am EDT.   During descent, the tri-module separation was nominal, and the 17S vehicle guidance system operated well.  Russian SAR (Search &amp; Rescue) helicopters sighted the parachute descent of the capsule and reached the crew immediately after touchdown.  The crewmembers were reported to be in excellent health.  They were flown to Karaganda to participate in the landing ceremony, and then boarded the GCTC (Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center) plane for Moscow. ]  
 
 After yesterday’s long post-nap workday (12:00pm – 3:45am this morning), the remaining ISS-19 crewmembers CDR Padalka, FE-1 Barratt &amp; FE-2 Wakata are enjoying a really long (22h15m) sleep &amp; rest period, from 3:45am – 2:00am tomorrow morning.   The station sleep/wake cycle will then be back on the standard 2:00am-5:30pm EDT period.
 
 CEO (Crew Earth Observations) photo targets uplinked for today were Mumbai, India Aerosol (as ISS approached India, the crew was to look forward and right towards the coastline for likely smog haze drifting out to sea.  Overlapping oblique shots, ending if possible with visible [i.e. identifiable] points on the ground, are helpful.  Smog hazes from major cities can remain as large coherent plumes for hundreds, even thousands of km from source areas), and Cairo, Egypt (the crew was to shoot overlapping images, at nadir and slightly left, to document the growth of this major city which is expanding eastward toward the Suez Canal).
