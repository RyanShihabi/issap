ISS On-Orbit Status 03/30/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     
 
Upon wake-up, CDR Kondratyev performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
Next, Kondratyev completed his 5<sup>th</sup> session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.      [For the session, Dima donned the electrode cap, prepared his head for the electrodes, and applied electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
Later in the day, Dmitri also completed another data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was his 10<sup>th</sup> run.     [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
FE-5 Nespoli began the major work of prepacking cargo for STS-134/ULF6, spending the first block of 3.5 hrs on this task.     [The next block of time will be next week.  An estimated 11 hrs are required to complete ULFD6 prepacking.  Most items are being packed in CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bags); some of them are uniquely packed.  Prepack staging location is in Node-2.  In order to prepack some items, the crew first has to remove their replacements from the ATV2 (Automated Transfer Vehicle) or, in two cases, the item will come from “Johannes Kepler”.] 
 
FE-6 Coleman continued her 4<sup>th</sup> 24-hr NUTRITION/Repository urine sample collections, with samples storing in MELFI, to be concluded tomorrow morning.  Her associated generic blood draw is also scheduled tomorrow, where Nespoli will assist with the phlebotomy as operator.     [Generic blood &amp; urine procedures are used which allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they must verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.  Urine samples go into MELFI within 30 minutes after collection.  Every individual urine/blood sample tube must be labeled with time of void and Crew ID.  Barcodes can be called down, placed in crew notes or the barcode reader can be used.  For the blood draw, there is a prior 8-hr fasting requirement, i.e., no food or drink, but water consumption is highly encouraged to ensure proper hydration.  Exercise should not be conducted during the 8 hrs prior to the blood draw.]
 
Coleman checked the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, verifying whether the device’s grounding strap is securely fastened and shows no damage.      [T2 was powered off by the ground last night due to an issue discovered on a T2 PAU (Power Avionics Unit) that was returned on ULF5, with evidence of arcing on one of the circuit boards. T2 was to be powered on again once the ground strap is reported OK.]
 
Afterwards, Cady worked in the JAXA JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) on the R&amp;R (removal &amp; replacement) of an electronic data transmission device, the LEHX (Layer 2 Ethernet Hub &amp; Multiplexer) 1553B, after reviewing task instructions and tagging up with ground specialists at SSIPC (Space Station Integration &amp; Promotion Center)/Tsukuba at ~4:35am EDT.
 
Later, Cady relocated the PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop and its power/data cabling, used during the HTV unberthing, from Cupola back to COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory). 
 
FE-5 Nespoli performed periodic maintenance on the ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) by evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition &amp; sensor calibration.
 
Nespoli also serviced the running BXF (Boiling eXperiment Facility) experiment in the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) by removing &amp; stowing the tapes from both analog recorders &amp; both digital recorders, labeling &amp; installing new tapes, and resetting the tape counters.  For the MABE (Microheater Array Boiling Experiment) part of the payload, Paolo verified that the Hi-8 recorders are in Short Play Mode.       [Replacement of the suspect SAMS TSH (Space Acceleration Measurement System Triaxial Sensor Head) power cable #3 with a new one (#1) has not solved solve the problem with the TSH, which indicates that the TSH itself is the issue.  BXF NPBX (Nucleate Pool Boiling Experiment) has been activated but requires SAMS for its science.  MABE does not require SAMS.  The ground is investigating the possibility of moving another SAMS TSH closer to the WV (Work Volume).]
 
Working on the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), Cady reconfigured the toilet system for feeding the internal EDV-U container, and reported the flush counter.
 
Afterwards, FE-6 assembled a new EDV-U from can &amp; lid components for use in the WHC after the current one is filled.
 
Activities performed by Dmitri Kondratyev included –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Setting up the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM (Service Module) window #9 for another sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), synchronized with the coaxially mounted NIKON D2X camera for taking snapshots, and later downloaded the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.  The equipment was then torn down and stowed away.    [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Servicing the running experiment TEKh-22 “Identifikatsiya” (Identification) in MRM1 (Mini Research Module 1) Rassvet, downloading the latest batch of structural dynamic data collected by the IMU-Ts microaccelerometer to the RSE1 A31p laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground via OCA.  [IMU-Ts is a part of the MRM1 SBI onboard measurement system, installed in PGO behind panel 104.],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Performing periodic maintenance work on the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor in the SM.    [Dima first replaced the VU sediment trap insert and BKO FGS gas-liquid mixture filter, then removed &amp; replaced the BRPK-2 Membrane Separator and installed an MFR Filter on Line 3 of SRVK-K2M (to increase separator life time), and afterwards also changed out the BKO Purification Column Assembly with a new spare.  The old units were discarded and the IMS (Inventory Management System) updated] and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo1">Conducting the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]</li></ul> 
FE-5 Nespoli completed another periodic relocation of the TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly, the primary radiation measurement tool in the ISS, moving it from US Lab (loc. O3) to the SM, panel 327, utilizing the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) power outlet 5.
 
Paolo also undertook another ~30 min Shuttle RPM (R-bar Pitch Maneuver) photography training session, using a NIKON D2Xs digital still camera with 800mm for taking practice shots of Earth ground features from SM windows #6 or #8.       [The practice session dealt with switching between auto &amp; manual focus and using manual override when in autofocus with which Paolo had some issue during Discovery/ULF5 arrival.  Autofocus is preferred for the RPM because it not only produces sharper images, but also allows for focus to be achieved quicker, resulting in a higher quantity of images.  The RPM drill prepares crewmembers for the bottom-side mapping of the Orbiter at their arrival at the ISS, currently STS-134/Endeavour/ULF6, to be launched 4/19.  During the RPM at ~600 ft from the station, the “shooters” have only ~90 seconds for taking high-resolution digital photographs of all tile areas and door seals on Discovery, to be downlinked for launch debris assessment.  Thus, time available for the shooting will be very limited, requiring great coordination between the two headset-equipped photographers and the Shuttle pilot.]
 
In the US A/L, Nespoli accessed the stowage area behind a panel on the AR (Avionics Rack (loc. F1) to retrieve a spare IRU (In-flight Refill Unit), also known as FPU (Fluid Pumping Unit), for return to Earth on ULF6.      [For access, Paolo had to remove and temporarily stow an EMU (Extravehicular Mobility Unit) and the EDDA (EMU Don/Doff Assembly), open the middle panel and take out the IRU, then reinstall panel, EDDA and EMU.]
 
Also working in the A/L, Cady Coleman –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Initiated the maintenance discharge process on the first batch of EVA batteries in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly), i.e., two EHIP (EVA Helmet Interchangeable Portable) light batteries,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Swapped EMUs 3005 &amp; 3011 between the Aft EDDA and the CL (Crewlock),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Swapped helmets between EMU 3010 &amp; 3011 before attaching them to the HUT (Hard Upper Torso), i.e. helmet #1074 on 3010, #1082 on 3011),</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Cycled the PPRV (Positive Pressure Relief Valve) on EMU 3011, a periodic maintenance task,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">“Degassed” 4 PWRs (Payload Water Reservoirs, #1005, #1026, #1007, #1025) as required, i.e., manually removed gas bubbles (by self-centrifugation) to minimize the amount of air introduced into the EMU, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2">Performed partial “dump &amp; fill” maintenance for the feedwater tanks of EMUs 3010 &amp; 3011 to satisfy maintenance requirements for on-orbit stowage (using the contents of PWR #1025, plus PWR #1027 for spare if required). </li></ul> 
At ~11:05am, Coleman had her weekly PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
At ~10:25am EDT, Paolo &amp; Cady supported an ESA PAO TV event at the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne. Germany to discuss the ESA Mission X Fitness Challenge “Train like an Astronaut”, with winning teams from several European venues in attendance.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the ARED advanced resistive exerciser (FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (CDR).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Dead Sea, Israel (looking to the left of track for the Dead Sea.  Overlapping frames of the Sea and its shorelines were requested, in support of authentic research being performed by the Charleston, IL Middle School Core E student team.  The team is participating in the NASA-funded Expedition Earth and Beyond project), Niamey, Niger (looking to the right of track for the capital city of Niger.  The city is located on a plateau bisected by the Niger River.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural area were requested), and San Salvador, El Salvador (ISS had a nadir-viewing pass over the capital city of El Salvador.  The city is located between the San Salvador volcano to the west and Lake Illopango [also of volcanic origin] to the east.  Overlapping mapping frames of the urban and surrounding rural areas were requested).
