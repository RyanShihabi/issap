ISS On-Orbit Status 05/16/09
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Saturday – light-duty day for the ISS crew.
 
  The crew performed the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough station cleaning.    ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the FE's sleep station with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
  As part of the house cleaning, Padalka conducted regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning on fan screens in the FGB (TsV2), DC1 (V3), and SM (VPkhO, VPrK, FS5, FS6 &amp; FS9), plus dust filter replacement in the FGB.
 
  Gennady also performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.   [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
  Additionally, the CDR did the periodic maintenance of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems in the SM &amp; FGB by cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting the POTOK in automatic mode.
 
  Mike performed the daily procedure of flushing the PWD (Potable Water Dispenser) ambient line with ~50mL of water (into a towel/Ziploc bag).  PWD water is currently cleared only for hygienic use, pending Russian approval.  
 
  The FE-1 also conducted the daily status check on the BCAT-4 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test 4) science payload, running by itself since 5/12 on Sample 5.    [The status check, conducted on the last image taken by the DCS 760 digital still camera which is controlled by EarthKAM software on an A31p laptop, is to verify proper image focus and camera alignment.  The SSC (Station Support Computer) is taking photography of the phase separation occurring in the BCAT Sample 3, with the photo flash going off every half hour.]
 
  For today’s VolSci (Voluntary Science) program, Wakata &amp; Barratt reviewed procedures, then activated the MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) and conducted another session with the SPICE (Smoke Point In Co-flow Experiment) payload, performed in the MSG and controlled by its A31p laptop with SPICE microdrives.  The activities were photographed and video-recorded.    [SPICE determines the point at which gas-jet flames (similar to a Butane-lighter flame) begin to emit soot (dark carbonaceous particulate formed inside the flame) in microgravity.  Studying a soot-emitting flame is important in understanding the ability of fires to spread and in control of soot in practical combustion systems space.  For each test point, the crewmembers adjusted the fuel flow rate until the flame was at the smoke point.  Science data are collected by still images and downlinked video.]
 
  Gennady performed the frequent status check on the Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") experiment, verifying proper operation of the BU Control Unit and MIS-LADA Module fans (testing their air flow by hand).    [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants under spaceflight conditions in the LADA-15 greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP).]
 
  At ~9:10am EDT, the crew conducted their regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-Houston and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners) via S-band/audio, reviewing the monthly calendar, upcoming activities, and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
  At ~4:10pm, Mike Barratt has his weekly PFC (Private Family Conference) scheduled, via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop).
 
  The crew completed their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the TVIS treadmill (CDR) and ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-2) and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (CDR, FE-1, FE-2).
 
  Afterwards, Koichi downloaded the exercise data file to the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) for downlink, including the daily wristband HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) data of the workouts on ARED, followed by their erasure on the HRM storage medium (done six times a week).
 
  Gennady had four job items on his discretionary “as time permits” task list for today:-  
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Packing &amp;      stowing a BVN air heater fan and two VD (vozduchovodiy,      air ducts) in the FGB,</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Conducting the      periodic audit/inventory of RS (Russian Segment) medical kits (which total      about 35),</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Setting      up the St. George Ribbons (lentochek) delivered on      Progress 33P on an interior panel so that they are visible during TV      conferences [the traditional patriotic “St.      George’s Ribbons” event observes the 64<sup>th</sup>      Anniversary of the WW2 victory in August], and</li> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Another session for      Russia's Environmental Safety Agency (EKON), making observations and      taking KPT-3 aerial photography of environmental conditions on earth using      the Nikon D2X with the SIGMA 300-800mm telephoto lens.</li> </ul>
