66 Progress (66P) Launch: 66P launched successfully from Baikonur, Kazakhstan on Tuesday at 11:23 pm CST with nominal ascent. Docking is scheduled for Friday, February 24th at 2:36 am CST.
SpaceX (SpX)-10 Capture: This morning’s rendezvous was aborted as a result of a bad ISS state vector being uplinked to the Dragon vehicle.  The SpaceX team is in the process of analyzing the cause of this bad state vector and how to prevent this in the future.  The ISS and SpaceX teams are preparing to perform a re-rendezvous tomorrow, February 23rd.  Capture is tentatively planned for 11:00 GMT (5:00 am CST). 
Crew Day:  As a result of the aborted SpX-10 capture, ground teams have elected to make today an off-duty day for the USOS crew.  As part of their off duty time today the crew performed their routine weekend housekeeping activities, since Saturday will now be a crew work day. 
Fluids Integrated Rack (FIR) White Light Cable Swap: The crew performed a swap of the White Light Fiber Optic (F/O) moving the cable from one light source to the other. The light from the FIR White Light Lamps is transmitted through the cables to the Light Microscopy Module (LMM) microscope to provide lighting to the experiment sample. LMM Biophysics 1 (The Effect of Macromolecular Transport of Microgravity Protein Crystallization) launched on SpX-10. When installed, investigators will use the results from LMM Biophysics 1 to examine the movement of single protein molecules in microgravity. By studying the crystals of a higher quality that can be grown in microgravity, scientists will be able to better understand their structure and how they work.
