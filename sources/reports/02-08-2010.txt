ISS On-Orbit Status 02/08/10
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Underway: Week 11 of Increment 22.
 
 Sleep shift in effect:  The crew’s workday began last evening at 5:39pm and ended this morning at 9:10am EST (see time table at bottom).
 
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>STS-130/Endeavour (ISS-20A) lifted off successfully on time at 4:14am EST after a one-day slip due to inclement RTLS weather, with all systems performing nominally, for rendezvous with ISS on Wednesday (2/11), set to dock at approximately 12:06am EST.  We are off to another great mission!   (And you had to be there to marvel at this gorgeous blastoff – the last night launch of the Shuttle Program!  Four Shuttle missions remain…  [The Orbiter is carrying the six-member crew of Commander George Zamka, Pilot Terry Virts, and Mission Specialists Kay Hire (MS1), Steve Robinson (MS2), Nicholas Patrick (MS3) and Bob Behnken (MS4).  STS-130 is the 130<sup>th</sup> space shuttle flight in history, the first Shuttle mission in 2010, the 24<sup>th</sup> flight for Endeavour, and the 32<sup>nd</sup> Shuttle flight to the ISS.  Primary payload for Endeavour are Node 3 “Tranquility” and the Cupola, a robotic control station with six windows around its sides and a seventh in the center, that will provide a panoramic view of Earth, celestial objects and visiting spacecrafts.  Cupola will be detached from the front port of Node 3 on FD8 (Flight Day 8) and relocated to Node 3 nadir.  There will be three spacewalks, each of about 6.5 hours in length, to be conducted on FD5, FD7 &amp; FD10, all by Behnken &amp; Patrick.  Mission duration is 13 days, and Endeavour will undock on FD12 and land on FD14. </li></ul> 
 At wake-up, FE-4 Kotov began his day with the regular daily checkup of the aerosol filters at the Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator.    [The filters were installed by Suraev on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).  Photographs are to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 CDR Williams &amp; FE-6 Creamer started another week-long session of the experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), TJ’s second, donning their Actiwatches, from which to log data to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.    [To monitor the crewmembers’ sleep/wake patterns and light exposure, the crewmembers sometimes wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by them as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition and use the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Oleg Kotov broke out &amp; set up the hardware for the Russian MBI-21 PNEVMOKARD experiment, then conducted the 1h15m session, his second, which forbids moving or talking during data recording.  The experiment is controlled from the RSE-med A31p laptop, equipped with new software, and uses the TENZOPLUS sphygmomanometer to measure arterial blood pressure, with Suraev taking documentary photography.  The experiment, supported by ground specialist tagup, was then closed out and the test data downlinked via OCA.      [PNEVMOKARD (Pneumocard) attempts to obtain new scientific information to refine the understanding about the mechanisms used by the cardiorespiratory system and the whole body organism to spaceflight conditions.  By recording (on PCMCIA cards) the crewmember’s electrocardiogram, impedance cardiogram, low-frequency phonocardiogram (seismocardiogram), pneumotachogram (using nose temperature sensors), and finger photoplethismogram, the experiment supports integrated studies of (1) the cardiovascular system and its adaptation mechanisms in various phases of a long-duration mission, (2) the synchronization of heart activity and breathing factors, as well as the cardiorespiratory system control processes based on the variability rate of physiological parameters, and (3) the interconnection between the cardiorespiratory system during a long-duration mission and the tolerance of orthostatic &amp; physical activities at the beginning of readaptation for predicting possible reactions of the crewmembers organism during the their return to ground.]
 
 FE-1 Suraev continued the integration of the newly arrived Progress M-04M/36P into the station systems by installing the LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry system and its ROM/read-only memory unit (PZU TA765B) in the spacecraft, both kept in storage from an earlier Progress.
 
 Afterwards, Maxim replaced/updated RODF (Russian Operations Data File) books with new procedural material delivered on 36P.    [The updates, separate sheets and cards, involve the books on Medical Experiments, Technical Experiments, BTKh, SOZh Life Support Systems, SOGS Atmosphere Revitalization System, RSU Manual Controls, and Progress 36P Cargo Transfer Ops (RPR).]  
 
 Suraev &amp; Kotov spent several hours with transferring excessed equipment and trash to Progress M-03/35P for stowage prior to its separation and burn-up on 4/27.
 
 The FE-1 had ~1.5h for setting up, photo/video recording and conducting the newly arrived BTKh-43 KONSTANTA experiment with the Rekomb-K bioreactor.    [BTKh-43 studies potential effects of spaceflight factors and their nature on the activity of a model enzyme relative to a specific substrate.  Bioreactors are specialized hardware for growing, cells, tissues, and microorganisms.]
 
 FE-5 Noguchi conducted a functional checkout and verification of MSG (Microgravity Science Glovebox) pressure sensors, using a laptop terminal to collect data, with the delta-P sensors first switched from sensor 1 to sensor 2 and then back to 1, with ground commanding between setting changes.  Laptop and MSG were then shut down.      [The MSG facility was activated quickly with no water flow on POIC (Payload Operations Integration Center) Go.  This Sensor Functional Verification is part of an annual verification test of the MSG facility.  It tests the temperature sensors and air handling unit systems. The test is composed of two main parts: Part 1 is the Loss of Cooling Test and Part 2 is the Air Handling Unit Test.]
 
 Maxim performed maintenance on the TVIS (Treadmill with Vibration Isolation &amp; Stabilization), primarily inspecting the condition of the SLDs (Subject Loading Devices) in contingency configuration, SLD cables for fraying and SPDs (Subject Positioning Devices), lubricating as required, plus recording time &amp; date values.
 
 In the SM, the FE-4 did the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Maxim took care of the daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).
 
 FE-6 Creamer had ~1hr to go looking for and locating a missing piece of spare Russian piping (truboprovod) for the WHC (Waste &amp; Hygiene Compartment), to be installed between the Russian-furnished MNR-NS pump separator and DKiV Pre-Treat Dispenser &amp; Water Pump (also called “Dose Pump”), a regularly scheduled part of 180-day preventive maintenance.    [The item had been manifested on 34P and also on 35P.]
 
 Creamer then worked on locating and configuring equipment associated with the PanOptic experiment, which requires application of eye drops causing eye dilation for subsequent ophthalmic examination.    [The TJ was also asked to verify that the Logitech software is still loaded on the PanOptic Hard drive.]
 
 TJ also performed the periodic maintenance &amp; visual inspection of the ARED (advanced resistive exercise device) rails &amp; rollers, greasing the Y- and Z-axis rails &amp; rollers and evacuating its cylinder flywheels to maintain proper vacuum condition and sensor calibration.
 
 FE-5 Noguchi cleaned up in the Kibo JPL (JEM Pressurized Module), consolidating JEM Payload and System items plus relocating Jettison Stowage Bags.
 
 Soichi also initiated (later terminated) another 5-hr sampling run (the 67<sup>th</sup>) with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health System Gas Chromatograph/Differential Mobility Spectrometer).  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC-12 laptop.    [The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware.]
 
 In the Lab, the CDR removed &amp; replaced the MCA (Major Constituency Analyzer) in the AR (Atmosphere Revitalization) rack, using a new spare from CTB (Cargo Transfer Bag) #1152, a ~3h40m task.
 
 Williams then re-downloaded the ICV HM 2 (Integrated Cardiovascular Holter Monitor 2) data of his recent single ICV session from an HM2 HiFi CF Card to the HRF PC1 (Human Research Facility Portable Computer 1) and powered down the laptop.
 
 In the Kibo laboratory, Noguchi prepared the JEMRMS (Robotic Manipulator System) Accumulators from their stowage location in the DMS1 (Data Management System 1) Rack and packed them for return on 20A.
 
 Tasks completed meanwhile by TJ Creamer included –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Replacement of the GDS (Gas Delivery System) bottle in GDS Tank-4 on the HRF Rack 2 with a new bottle,</li><li>Unstowing the SWAB (Surface Water &amp; Air Biocharacterization) experiment kit and collecting two water samples (for the 7<sup>th</sup> time), then stowing the samples in a bag-to-bag transfer after letting the Hot sample cool down, and</li><li>Working on CWC-Is (Iodinated Contingency Water Containers) #1015 &amp; #2009 to remove air bubbles (by centrifugation at ~15 RPM).</li></ul> 
 Working in the JAXA JPM, TJ first removed stowage items from the front of the ZSR (Zero-G Storage Rack) and the ROBoT equipment to allow the rack’s removal, then transferred the ZSR with Soichi to the Lab (loc. D4) and reinstalled ROBoT.
 
 Soichi had ~30 min set aside for another JAXA EPO (Educational Payload Operation), EPO-4/Paper Craft Making (the third), for which he printed out printed folding patterns and then made traditional Japanese Origami figures.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-1 FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6).
 
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Sleep shifting started with the Progress docking on 2/4.  On 2/6, crew wake shifted earlier, to 5:40pm EST.  20A Undock will drive Crew Wake one and a half hours earlier to 4:09pm by FD12.  This shift is accomplished by moving Crew Sleep 30 min earlier on FDs 6-10, and then again on FD11 and FD12.  Wake/Sleep table:</li></ul>
