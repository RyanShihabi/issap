ISS On-Orbit Status 09/05/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Labor Day (US Holiday)  -  Crew off-duty day.    Underway:  Week 25 of Increment 28.   
 
As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, CDR Borisenko performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel.
 
Also during Morning Inspection, FE-1 Samokutyayev did the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
FE-5 Furukawa &amp; FE-6 Fossum undertook their 13<sup>th</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.        [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
FE-4 Volkov performed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and ensured proper watering of the KM A32 &amp; A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)],
 
Furukawa opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Satoshi will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use
 
Samokutyayev started downloading GFI-7 Molniya-GAMMA data from the RSK-1 laptop to a PC HDD (Hard Disk Drive) slated for return to the ground.  About an hour later, Sasha terminated the copying process.       [The GFI-17 “Molniya” FOTON-GAMMA experiment, mounted externally since the Russian EVA-28, investigates atmospheric gamma-ray bursts and optical radiation in conditions of thunderstorm activity.]
 
Andrey Borisenko completed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
FE-5 performed another session of the psychological POMS (Profile of Mood States) experiment, completing his questionnaire for downlink to ground specialist.
 
Later, Satoshi set up the G1 HD (High Definition) camcorder and started downlinking test data for checking out the ISPR A5 HRDL (International Standard Payload Rack A5 / High-Rate Data Line) connection after the recent (9/2) APS ORU (Automated Payload Switch Orbit Replaceable Unit) replacements by Ron &amp; Mike.  G1 &amp; MPC (Multi Protocol Converter) were deactivated again ~10 min later.
 
Volkov configured the Russian DZZ-12 RUSALKA (“Mermaid”) hardware at SM window #9 for another sun-glint observation session, using the hand-held spectrometer (without use of the TIUS three-stage rate sensor), and later downloaded the data to laptop RS1 for subsequent downlink via OCA.      [RUSALKA is a micro spectrometer for collecting detailed information on observed spectral radiance in the near IR (Infrared) waveband for measurement of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth atmosphere.]
 
Before sleeptime, Sergei will start battery charging for the Russian GFI-8 "Uragan" (hurricane) earth-imaging program with FSS science hardware for another run tomorrow.     [The FSS (Fotospektralnaya sistema) system consists of an image recording module with lens and a spectroradiometer module with an electronics module.  FSS includes the ME Electronics Module &amp; MRI Image Recording Module.]
 
At ~3:50am EDT, Andrey, Sasha &amp; Sergei supported two Russian PAO TV events, downlinking addresses of greetings to (1) the 24<sup>th</sup> Planetary Congress of the SFPA (Space Flight Participant Association), to be held in Moscow from 9/5-9/9, and (2) the Domodedovo 2011 Ham Radio festival, taking place 9/15-9/18 in the Moskvich (Muscovite) recreation facility in the Domodedovo city district, Moscow region, supported by the district administration with the participation of Russia’s DOSAAF (Volunteer Association In Support Of <a href="http://www.multitran.ru/c/m.exe?t=4684136_1_2">Army, Air Force And Navy</a>) and sponsored by the Russian Armature Radio Union, including ham radio operators from the CIS (<a href="http://www.multitran.ru/c/m.exe?t=652218_1_2">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>), Asia, Europe, and America.
 
At ~4:40am, Borisenko, Samokutyayev &amp; Garan tagged up with their technical support team at TsUP-Moscow to review &amp; discuss procedures for Soyuz emergency descent.
 
Before “Presleep” period tonight, Ron turns on the MPC and starts the data flow of video recorded during the day to the ground, with POIC (Payload Operations &amp; Integration Center) routing the onboard HRDL (High-Rate Data Link).  After about an hour, MPC will be turned off again.      [This is a routine operation which regularly transmits HD onboard video (live or tape playback) to the ground on a daily basis before sleeptime.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (CDR, FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-1, FE-3, FE-4, FE-5, FE-6), and T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6).
 
A task listed for Andrey, Sergei &amp; Sasha on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” job for today continued to be the preparation &amp; downlinking of more reportages (written text, photos, videos) for the Roskosmos website to promote Russia’s manned space program (max. file size 500 Mb).
 
No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today.
