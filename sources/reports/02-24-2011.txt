ISS On-Orbit Status 02/24/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Godspeed, Discovery! 
 
ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” docked successfully at the SM (Service Module) aft port at 10:59am EST.  ATV hooks were closed at 11:06am, SM hooks at 11:09am.  Congratulations, ESA!       [At ~5:53am, the 20.7-ton unmanned ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) maneuvered from a holding position 39 km behind and 5 km below the ISS, set up a direct link with the Station and conducted a 4-hour staged approach with several stops at reference points for checks.  At a distance of 249 m, the ATV computers autonomously computed its own position through relative GPS (Global Positioning System) data, comparing with GPS data received from ISS and in close range using VDM (Videometer) lasers pointed at LRRs (Laser Retroreflectors) on the SM for distance &amp; orientation determination relative to its target.  Final approach was at a relative velocity of 7 cm/s and with an accuracy of better than 10 cm.  The cargo transport, which remains docked for the next four months, is delivering 1,600 kg of dry cargo, including food, clothes and equipment; 4534 kg of ISS reboost/attitude control propellants, 850 kg of ISS refuel propellant to be transferred, and 100 kg gaseous oxygen.    Note:  Prior to the start of closing maneuvers, ATV-CC (Control Center/Toulouse) experienced a problem with one of its console tools which resulted in loss of ability to independently verify correct onboard boost computation, as required to monitor two Flight Rules.  After discussion, these FRs were waived since the vehicle remained safe without these checks being performed, and in the knowledge that the NASA VVO (Visiting Vehicle Officer) console tools can perform a similar check to provide a level of confidence in the onboard boost computations.  Later, the Russian Simvol display in the SM failed while ATV was at the S3 station keeping point.  TsUP-Moscow performed troubleshooting and recovered Simvol.  This caused an approximately 15 minute delay in ATV leaving S3.  As for the ATV itself: all systems performed flawlessly during the docking.]
 
In preparation for the docking –
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Nespoli powered down the amateur/ham radio equipment in the SM to prevent RF interference with the cargo ship  [it was turned back on later in the day],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">FE-5 also configured the SM STTS communications panel 2 for the docking, taking out the RSA-2 channel to prevent possible echo/feedback,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Coleman closed the shutters of the US Lab, Node-3/Cupola and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) to protect them against thruster effluents  [reopened before sleep time],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Skripochka activated &amp; verified proper operation of the Russian TEKh-15/DAKON-M IZGIB (“Bend”) experiment in the SM for taking structural dynamics data during the ATV2 berthing    [afterwards, FE-2 downlinked the data to the ground and shut off DAKON.  IZGIB has the objective to help update mathematical models of the ISS gravitation environment, using accelerometers of the Russian SBI Onboard Measurement System, the GIVUS high-accuracy angular rate vector gyrometer of the SUDN Motion Control &amp; Navigation System and other accelerometers for unattended measurement of micro-accelerations at science hardware accommodation locations - (1) in operation of onboard equipment having rotating parts (gyrodynes, fans), (2) when establishing and keeping various ISS attitude modes, and (3) when performing crew egresses into space and physical exercises],</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Oleg also activated &amp; tested the Ku-band video “scheme” for transferring &amp; downlinking streaming video via the MPEG-2 (Moving Pictures Expert Group 2) encoder, after Paolo had activated the A31p laptop in the FGB for the video conversion to US NTSC format,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Kaleri &amp; Nespoli configured the PCE (Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL) in the SM for the docking [involving the MBRL AFU (Antenna Feeder Unit) and ATV PU Hand Controller], and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">Monitored the approach &amp; docking.</li></ul> 
After the docking, Kaleri disconnected &amp; removed the ATV PU Hand Controller unit with its power cable, covered the ATV connectors and stowed PU in the FGB.
 
Nespoli reconfigured the SM STTS comm panels for nominal stage operations.
 
Later in the day, Skripochka supported the ground-commanded re-activation of the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator (~1:05pm) by monitoring the external temperature of its secondary purification unit (BD) for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.      [Elektron had been shut down for the docking.  The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]
 
FE-4 Kondratyev conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Dmitri will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
After CDR Kelly broke out and set up the appropriate equipment, FE-6 Coleman acted as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) for his first session with the periodic 30-min US PHS (Periodic Health Status)/Without Blood Labs exam.  The CDR then logged the data and stowed the equipment.  A subjective evaluation was part of the test.      [The assessment used the AMP (Ambulatory Medical Pack), stethoscope, oral disposable thermometer and ABPC (Automatic Blood Pressure Cuff) from the ALSP (Advanced Life Support Pack).  All data were then logged on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) and the hardware stowed.  The PHS exam is guided by special IFEP (In-Flight Examination Program) software on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer) laptop.]
 
In preparation for the arrival of STS-133/Discovery on the ULF5 mission next Saturday (2/26), Scott &amp; Cady –
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Removed the OA2 panel in the A/L as a get-ahead for the Shuttle-fed O<sub>2</sub> setup for EVA campout/prebreathe on FD6,
<?if !supportLists?>·         <?endif?>Configured THC IMV (Temperature &amp; Humidity Control /Intermodular Ventilation) diffusers in the Lab to optimize air mixing in the Lab for CO<sub>2</sub> removal, with the additional station occupants on board,
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Installed the Node-2 air duct for increased Shuttle ventilation,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Temporarily relocated the SSC-5 (Station Support Computer 5) laptop to the Node-3 Cupola to provide additional robotics viewing during ULF5,</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Relocated the CUP PCS (Portable Computer System) laptop to Node-3 to support ULF5, and</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2">Readied two BPSMUs (Battery Powered Speaker Microphone Units, #5244, #5245) for use by the Shuttle crew during the docked phase with the Orbiter [using two A31p laptops in the Lab, one BMPSU was placed at the Lab RWS (Robotic Workstation), the other near the Node-2 nadir hatch for PMM operations.  The long dual drag-through cables will be plugged in at a drag-through QD assembly at the PMA-2, with one half assigned to the station, the other to the Shuttle.]</li></ul> 
Scott Kelly retrieved a ~1 L water sample from the WRS WPA PWD (Water Recovery System / Water Processor Assembly / Potable Water Dispenser) Auxiliary Port.
 
Condensate water specimens were also collected by Skripochka, drawing “ULF-5” samples from the BRP SRV-K Warm, SRV-K Hot and SVO-ZV taps.
 
Dmitri Kondratyev continued the current round of monthly preventive maintenance of RS (Russian Segment) ventilation systems, inspecting the GZhT gas-liquid heat exchanger surfaces and grilles of the two air conditioners (SKV1 &amp; SKV2) for foreign objects or dust accumulation, photographing them and then cleaning them with vacuum cleaner and wipes.    [SKV2 is operating.] 
 
Afterwards, Dmitri checked &amp; reset the RSK2 laptop, a T61p model with USB Converter/Adapter for the Russian KPT-14 SHADOW-BEACON (Tenj-Mayak) experiment, connected to the Kenwood D700 ”Sputnik” amateur/ham radio.      [With the T61p-USB driver installed, RSK2 settings need to be reset after every laptop restart (since settings disappear at each reset).]
 
FE-4 Kondratyev performed major maintenance work on the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor in the SM.      [Dima first replaced the VU sediment trap insert and BKO FGS gas-liquid mixture filter, then removed &amp; replaced the BRPK-2 Membrane Separator and installed an MFR Filter on Line 3 of SRVK-K2M (to increase separator life time), and afterwards also changed out the BKO Purification Column Assembly with a new spare.  The old units were discarded and the IMS (Inventory Management System) updated.]
 
Cady Coleman completed another periodic relocation of the TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter) detector assembly, the primary radiation measurement tool in the ISS, moving it from Node-3 (loc. F3) to the US Lab (loc. O3), utilizing UOP2 (Utility Outlet Panel 2).
 
Working on the ELT (Experiment Laptop Terminal) in Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), FE-6 downloaded and saved the ECG (electrocardiogram) data recorded for the last 24 hrs from her 2<sup>nd</sup> session (of 3 total) with the JAXA biomedical experiment BIORHYTHMS, for which she yesterday had donned the DWH (Digital Walk Holter) electrodes for ECG recording.
 
In COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), Cady readied the PPFS (Portable Pulmonary Function System) hardware including MBS (Mixing Bag System), and then conducted her 3<sup>rd</sup> session with the VO<sub>2</sub>max assessment, integrated with Thermolab.  After downloading the data to a PCS laptop, Cady powered down, cleaned up and fully stowed all equipment.       [The experiment VO<sub>2</sub>max uses the PPFS, CEVIS ergometer cycle, PFS (Pulmonary Function System) gas cylinders and mixing bag system, plus multiple other pieces of hardware to measure oxygen uptake, cardiac output, and more.  The exercise protocol consists of a 2-min rest period, then three 5-min stages at workloads eliciting 25%, 50% &amp; 75% of aerobic capacity as measured pre-flight, followed by a 25-watt increase in workload every minute until the crewmember reaches maximum exercise capacity.  At that point, CEVIS workload increase is stopped, and a 5-min cool down period follows at the 25% load.  Rebreathing measurements are initiated by the subject during the last minute of each stage.  Constraints are: no food 2 hrs prior to exercise start, no caffeine 8 hrs prior to exercise, and must be well hydrated.]
 
CDR Kelly repeated yesterday’s routine maintenance on the CSA-CP (Compound Specific Analyzer-Combustion Products) prime unit (#1058) by replacing its battery with a new one, then zero-calibrating all units.    [Yesterday’s replacement had erroneously been done with a used battery.  CSA-CP is a passive cabin atmosphere monitor that provides quick response capability during a combustion event (fire). Its collected data are stored on a logger. Following zero calibration, the prime unit was re-deployed at the SM Central Post.]
 
Kelly also retrieved the two CSA-O<sub>2</sub> instruments (CSA-Oxygen, #1041, #1045) from the Soyuz TMA-01M/24S and calibrated them in the Lab for their weekly checkout, taking readings, then turning them off again and returning them to 24S.     [The oxygen sensors in the CSA-O<sub>2</sub>s (and CSA-CPs/CSA-Combustion Products) have exceeded their shelf life due to resupply delays.  The weekly calibration checks permit continued use of these units until new ones arrive on ULF-5.]
 
In the Kibo JPM, Scott moved the two EMUs (Extravehicular Mobility Units) #3010 &amp; # 3011 from their current location at A7 to the front of rack bay F7 (without blocking fire ports).      [The other two EMUs, #3009 &amp; #3005, can remain at A7.]
 
In the US Airlock, the CDR terminated the maintenance recharge on the EMU batteries in the BSA (Battery Stowage Assembly (BSA).
 
Kelly also performed another weekly 10-min. CWC (Contingency Water Container) inventory as part of the on-going WRM (Water Recovery &amp; Management) assessment of onboard water supplies.  Updated “cue cards” based on the crew’s water calldowns are sent up every other week for recording changes.        [The current card (26-0045I) lists 113 CWCs (2,302.6 L total) for the five types of water identified on board: 1. technical water (18 CWCs with 716.5 L, for Elektron electrolysis, incl. 388.5 L in 10 bags containing Wautersia bacteria, 134.2 L in 3 clean bags for contingency use, 170.8 L in 4 bags for transfer into EDV-RP containers via US/RSA-B hose, and 23.0 L in 1 bag for flushing only;  2. potable water (no CWCs);  3. iodinated water (83 CWCs with 1,537.3 L for reserve, of which 271.9 L in 15 CWCs are listed as “expired”;  4. condensate water (22.9 L in 2 bags, with 6.3 L in 1 bag to be used only for OGA, plus 8 empty bags); and  5. waste/EMU dump and other (25.9 L in 2 CWCs from hose/pump flush).  Wautersia bacteria are typical water-borne microorganisms that have been seen previously in ISS water sources.  These isolates pose no threat to human health.]
 
After the recent conclusion of his latest (8<sup>th</sup>) session with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), Scott Kelly downloaded the data from his A/W (Actiwatch) via the A/W Reader to the HRF (Human Research Facility 1) laptop and initialized the A/W, then decabled &amp; stowed the hardware and powered off the PC.
 
FE-2 conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.      [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Oleg &amp; Dmitri both had about an hour set aside for more cargo unloading and transfer from Progress M-09M/41P, docked at DC1 nadir.
 
Oleg also spent ~1hr on shooting more newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7 #2 high-definition camcorder as part of the ongoing effort to create a photo &amp; video imagery database on the flight of ISS-25/26 (“Flight Chronicles”), focusing on payload scenes.     [Footage subjects generally include life on the station, personal hygiene, food intake, playing with water, enjoying weightlessness, exercise, moving about, station interior, Earth surface, space clothing, cosmonaut at work, station cleaning, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.]
 
Kelly, Coleman &amp; Nespoli filled out their weekly FFQs (Food Frequency Questionnaires) on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer).      [On the FFQs, NASA astronauts keep a personalized log of their nutritional intake over time on special MEC software.  Recorded are the amounts consumed during the past week of such food items as beverages, cereals, grains, eggs, breads, snacks, sweets, fruit, beans, soup, vegetables, dairy, fish, meat, chicken, sauces &amp; spreads, and vitamins.  The FFQ is performed once a week to estimate nutrient intake from the previous week and to give recommendations to ground specialists that help maintain optimal crew health.  Weekly estimation has been verified to be reliable enough that nutrients do not need to be tracked daily.]
 
At ~3:30am EST, Nespoli conducted a tagup with the ESA staff at Col-CC at Oberpfaffenhofen/Germany.    [This conference is scheduled once every week, between ISS crewmembers and Col-CC via S/G2 (Space-to-Ground 2) audio.]
 
At ~10:20am, Scott &amp; Cady had their regular IMS stowage conference with Houston stowage specialists.
 
The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (CDR, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), and ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-5, FE-6).        [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but is done regularly after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
ATV Reboost:    Tomorrow morning at 5:33am EST, a one-burn ISS test reboost with ATV2 “Johannes Kepler” OCS (Orbit Correction System) thrusters will be conducted for a duration of 198 sec and a delta-V of 0.5 m/s.  Purpose of the reboost is to test the ATV OCS thrusters as well as set up phasing for 24S landing and 26S launch.
 
CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uplinked for today were Colombo, Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka’s largest city of nearly 6 million is located on the southwest coast of this island nation.  ISS had a mid-afternoon pass with fair weather expected as it approached from the SW.  As it neared the south coast of the island, the crew was to look just left of track for this port city located south of the large coastal lagoon Negombo), Nyiragongo Volcano, Republic of Congo (a temporary, seasonal break in the weather of this usually cloudy Equatorial region offers a rare photography opportunity for this target located in the East Africa Rift region.  ISS had a mid-afternoon, nadir pass in fair weather with an approach from the SW.   Nyiragongo is a large stratovolcano with a prominent summit crater.  The most recent activity includes production of minor ash and steam plumes.  Overlapping mapping frames of the volcano summit and flanks are requested.  Another active volcano, Nyamuragira, is located immediately to the NM and is recognizable by its dark lava flows.  If visible, overlapping frames of this topographically lower shield volcano were also requested), and Panama City, Panama (the capital city of Panama with its population of about 1 million is located on the southern coast of the nation just east of the Pacific entrance to the Panama Canal.  It is the dry season in Central America and ISS had a nadir pass for this target under fair skies in mid-afternoon light.  The crew approached the Isthmus of Panama from the SW off the open Pacific).
