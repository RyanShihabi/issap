ISS On-Orbit Status 11/20/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sunday.  Ahead:  Week 1 of Increment 30 (three-person crew).        &gt;&gt;&gt;Today 12 years ago (1998), the 20-ton FGB “Zarya” (Sunrise), the first module of the ISS, was launched at Baikonur/Kazakhstan on a three-stage Proton.  The US-financed “Funktsionalnyi-Grusovoi Blok” was built by KhSC (Khrunichev State Research &amp; Production Space Center) from their original Almaz program under subcontract to Boeing.&lt;&lt;&lt; 
 
Crew Wake/Sleep cycle shift:   To accommodate Soyuz 27S undock tomorrow evening at 6:00pm EST, crew wake/sleep cycle changes go into effect, featuring a late turn-in today and tomorrow, plus a free day Tuesday:
WAKE (EST)    SLEEP (EST)
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l5 level1 lfo1">Today (11/20)                           1:00am             6:00pm</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l5 level1 lfo1">Tomorrow (Monday, 11/21)       6:30am             1:00am (11/22)</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l5 level1 lfo1">Tuesday (11/22)                       Free Day          ~4:30pm</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l5 level1 lfo1">Wednesday (11/23)                   1:00am             4:30pm (regular)</li></ul> 
After wakeup, FE-4 Volkov performed the routine inspection of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel as part of regular Daily Morning Inspection.
 
First thing in Postsleep, prior to eating, drinking &amp; brushing teeth, CDR Fossum, FE-3 Burbank &amp; FE-5 Furukawa today conducted the dry saliva sample collections on the INTEGRATED IMMUNE protocol.  Later in the day, Mike, Dan &amp; Satoshi also completed the IMMUNE blood sample draws, with Dan assisting Satoshi as Operator and vice versa, plus Satoshi assisting Mike.  Following the blood draws, the full blood tubes were temp stowed in the blood collection kit until tomorrow when they will be packed together with the saliva samples on the Soyuz for return to ground.            [INTEGRATED IMMUNE (Validating Procedures for Monitoring Crew member Immune Function) samples &amp; analyzes participant’s blood, urine, and saliva before, during and after flight for changes related to functions like bone metabolism, oxidative damage and immune function to develop and validate an immune monitoring strategy consistent with operational flight requirements and constraints.  The strategy uses both long and short duration crewmembers as study subjects. The saliva is collected in two forms, dry and liquid.  The dry samples are collected at intervals during the collection day using a specialized book that contains filter paper.  The liquid saliva collections require that the crewmembers soak a piece of cotton inside their mouths and place it in a salivette bag; there are four of the liquid collections during docked operations.  The on-orbit blood samples are collected right before undocking and returned to the ground so that analysis can occur with 48 hours of the sampling.  This allows assays that quantify the function of different types of white blood cells and other active components of the immune system.  Samples are secured in the MELFI (Minus-Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS).  Also included are entries in a fluid/medications intact log, and a stress-test questionnaire to be filled out by the subject at begin and end.  Urine is collected during a 24-hour period, conventionally divided into two twelve-hour phases: morning-evening and evening-morning.]
 
After wake-up, Fossum &amp; Furukawa completed their final post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.       [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
Also early in Postsleep, CDR &amp; FE-5 undertook their 23<sup>rd</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures session, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started for them last night.  This is usually done on Mondays.        [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
FE-1 Shkaplerov terminated his first experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
FE-2 Ivanishin completed the periodic maintenance of the active Russian BMP Harmful Impurities Removal System, starting the “bake-out” cycle to vacuum on absorbent bed #2 of the regenerable dual-channel filtration system.  Anatoly will terminate the process at ~4:05pm EST.  Bed #1 regeneration was performed yesterday.  (Done last: 10/24 &amp; 10/25).       [Regeneration of each of the two cartridges takes about 12 hours and is conducted only during crew awake periods. The BMP’s regeneration cycle is normally done every 20 days.]
 
Dan Burbank performed the daily service of the BCAT-6 (Binary Colloidal Alloy Test-6)-Phase Separation experiment, checking the running BCAT-6 payload for camera &amp; flashlight battery charge.  The Nikon D2Xs camera with EarthKAM software running with the Intervalometer on SSC-18 (Station Support Computer 18) is taking automated flash photography of Sample 3.      [After starting on 11/10, the camera is operating for a total of 7 days, taking one photo every 2 hrs.  Camera battery change and Intervalometer restart is done three times a day.  Objective of BCAT-6 Phase Separation: to gain unique insights into how gas and liquid phases separate and come together in microgravity.  These fundamental studies on the underlying physics of fluids could provide the understanding needed to enable the development of less expensive, longer shelf-life household products, foods, and medicines.]
 
In preparation for tomorrow’s Soyuz undocking, Sergey Volkov worked in the TMA-02M spacecraft’s Orbital Module (BO), disconnecting &amp; taking out the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit, for stowage and recycling in a future vehicle.
 
Also for the undocking, Sergey set up the Motorola Iridium-9505A satellite phone of the Soyuz TMA-02M/27S (#702, docked at MRM1) for recharging, assisted by Anton Shkaplerov.  Later, they terminated the process, stowed the phone in the 27S Descent Module and closed out.   (Done last time: 10/11).          [After retrieving the phone from its location in the spacecraft Descent Module (SA, spuskayemyy apparat), the crewmembers initiated the recharge of the lithium-ion battery, monitoring the process every 10-15 minutes as it took place.  Upon completion, the phone was returned inside their SSSP Iridium kits and stowed back in the SA’s ODF (operational data files) container.  The satphone accompanies returning ISS crews on Soyuz reentry &amp; landing for contingency communications with SAR (Search-and-Rescue) personnel after touchdown (e.g., after an “undershoot” ballistic reentry, as happened during the 15S return).  The Russian-developed procedure for the monthly recharging has been approved jointly by safety officials.  During the procedure, the phone is left in its fire-protective fluoroplastic bag with open flap.  The Iridium 9505A satphone uses the Iridium constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites to relay the landed Soyuz capsule's GPS (Global Positioning System) coordinates to helicopter-borne recovery crews.  The older Iridium-9505 phones were first put on board Soyuz in August 2003.  The newer 9505A phone, currently in use, delivers 30 hours of standby time and three hours of talk, up from 20 and two hours, respectively, on the older units.]
 
FE-5 Furukawa had several more hours reserved to continue updating the EMER-1 and EMER-2 books with new SODF (Station Operation Data File) procedures printed out yesterday.        [There are 6 EMER-1 books (SM, each Soyuz, Lab, FGB, Node-2) and 3 EMER-2 books (SM, FGB, Lab).  They are updated regularly with changing station configuration and crew size.]
 
Shkaplerov undertook his first session with the Russian behavioral assessment TIPOLOGIA (MBI-20), setting up the workstation, connecting equipment, suiting up and launching the program on the RSK1 laptop.         [Ivanishin stood by to assist Anton in donning the electrode cap, preparing the head for the electrodes and applying electrode gel from the Neurolab-RM2 kit.  Data were recorded on a PCMCIA memory card and downlinked via OCA comm.  MBI-20 studies typological features of operator activity of the ISS crews in long-term space flight phases, with the subject using a cap with EEG (electroencephalogram) electrodes.  The experiment, which records EEGs, consists of the Lüscher test, “adaptive biological control” training, and the games Minesweeper and Tetris.  The Lüscher color diagnostic is a psychological test which measures a person's psychophysical state, his/her ability to withstand stress, to perform and to communicate.  It is believed to help uncover the cause of psychological stress, which can lead to physical symptoms.  An EEG measures and records the electrical activity of the brain.]
 
Volkov used the standard ECOSFERA equipment to conduct Stage 2 of the microbial air sampling runs for the MedOps SZM-MO-21 experiment, with the POTOK Air Purification System temporarily powered down, taking Kit 2 samples from cabin surfaces along with samples from crewmembers for sanitation and disease studies.  The Petri dishes with the samples were then stowed in the KRIOGEM-03 thermostatic container and subsequently packed in Kit #А25 Petri dishes for return in Soyuz 27S, along with Kit A24 of Stage 1 of the MO-21 protocol, done yesterday, including overnight recharge of the Ecosphere battery.      [The equipment, consisting of an air sampler set, a charger and power supply unit, provides samples to help determine microbial contamination of the ISS atmosphere, specifically the total bacterial and fungal microflora counts and microflora composition according to morphologic criteria of microorganism colonies.  Because the Ecosphere battery can only support 10 air samples on one charge, the sample collection was performed in two stages.]
 
In preparation for his return to gravity tomorrow night, Sergey Volkov undertook Part 2 of his 5<sup>th</sup> and final exercise/training session of the Russian MO-5 MedOps protocol of cardiovascular evaluation in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure device (ODNT, US: LBNP) on the VELO bike ergometer, assisted by Anatoly Ivanishin as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Medical telemetry monitoring on the ground was at 5:13am EST.  The activity was then closed out.       [The assessments, lasting one hour each, supported by ground specialist tagup (VHF) and telemetry monitoring from Russian ground sites, uses the Gamma-1 ECG equipment with biomed harness, skin electrodes and a blood pressure and rheoplethysmograph cuff wired to the cycle ergometer's instrumentation panels. The Chibis ODNT provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmembers’ orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after several months in zero-G.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by two cycles of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, set at -25, -30, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each, then -25, -30, and -40 mmHg (Torr) for 10 min. each plus -30mmHg for 5 min. while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
CDR Fossum took the Exp-30 crew, Shkaplerov, Ivanishin &amp; Burbank, through an important 1-hr emergency egress drill, to familiarize them with the location of emergency equipment (including hatches and passageways), focusing particularly on the passage along the emergency evacuation route.        [Safety is of primary concern on board.  Due to the shortened handover period, the execution of this drill was set up in two parts.  In Part 1, the crewmembers performed the prescribed Ammonia Hardware checks for MRM2 and FGB PGO (Cargo Compartment), then switched to the USOS modules PMA-1, Node-1, Node-2, Node-3, Airlock, Lab, PMM, JPM &amp; JLP, followed by a general review and a debriefing.]
 
Again most of the workday was spent on Crew Handover activities between the 27S &amp; 28S crewmembers, to familiarize the new Expedition 29/30 residents with onboard equipment and procedures.
 
Anton, Anatoly &amp; Sergey performed Day 4 service on the 28S-delivered Russian bioengineering experiments.     
[In particular, the Russian Flight Engineers �C
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Transferred the BTKh-35 MEMBRANA experiment to 27S and stowed it,
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Checked out and transferred BIO-1 POLYGENE,
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Moved the BTKh-6,7 ARIL/OChB payload from the KRIOGEM-03 cooler (+4 degC) to 27S,
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Mixed a new sample (#4) of the BTKh-26 KASKAD experiment in the KT thermal enclosure in the GB/Glavboks-S (Glovebox-S), then terminated it and stowed it in 27S,
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Transferred the BTKh-40 BIF to the KRIOGEM-03 cooler (+4 degC), and
<?if !supportLists?>・        <?endif?>Transferred the BTKh-41 BAKTERIOFAG and BTKh-29 Zhenshen-2 (Ginseng-2) kits to 27S for return to Earth, after taking documentary photography (these two were delivered on Progress 45P on 11/2).
 
Main responsibility for loading these payloads on Soyuz was with FE-4 Volkov.
 
In the 27S Descent Module, FE-4 also activated the ASU toilet facility.
 
FE-2 Ivanishin performed the periodic checkout &amp; performance verification of IP-1 airflow sensors in the various RS (Russian Segment) hatchways.      [Inspected IP-1s are in the passageways PrK (SM Transfer Tunnel)�CRO (SM Working Compartment), PkhO (SM Transfer Compartment)�CRO, PkhO�CDC1, PkhO�CFGB PGO, PkhO-MRM2, FGB GA-MRM1, FGB PGO�CFGB GA, and FGB GA�CNode-1.]
 
Furukawa collected the 17 Soyuz 27S-delivered RBO-3 MATRYOSHKA-R PADLE (Passive Area Dosimeters for Lifescience Experiment) radiation dosimeters from the walls of the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) and JPL (JEM Pressurized Logistics Segment) and turned them over to Anatoly &amp; Anton who packed for return to Earth on 27S.
 
At ~3:10am, Ivanishin supported the automated sequencer-commanded reactivation of the Elektron-VM O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator, first performing the usual buffer volume compression, then monitoring the external temperature of its BD secondary purification unit for the first 10 minutes of operations to ensure that there was no overheating.  RCT (Russian Contingency Telemetry) downlinked salient activation data packets via S-band.  Elektron had been turned off by the ground for the 28S docking and ISS reboost.         [The gas analyzer used on the Elektron during nominal operations for detecting hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) in the O<sub>2</sub> line (which could cause dangerous overheating) is not included in the control algorithm until 10 minutes after Elektron startup.]
 
Volkov conducted the MO-22 Sanitary-Epidemiological Status check, part of the Russian MedOps program done on structures and crewmembers usually before Soyuz departures.       [To monitor for microflora, Sergey collected samples from surface areas of interior panels and hardware at numerous locations in the SM, FGB, MRM1, MRM2 and DC1, also from himself, FE-1 Shkaplerov &amp; FE-2 Ivanishin using cotton swabs and special test tubes which were then stowed in 27S for return to the ground.]
 
FE-2 Ivanishin completed his first data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.         [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
Shkaplerov &amp; Ivanishin again had about an hour of free time for general orientation (adaptation, station familiarization &amp; acclimatization) as is standard daily rule for fresh crewmembers for the first two weeks after starting residence, if they choose to take it.
 
With ISS being officially transferred from Exp-29 to Exp-30, Anton &amp; Sergey at ~2:00pm signed two copies of the formal Russian handover protocol document certifying RS handover/acceptance, including the contents of Progress M-13M/45P (#413), currently docked at DC Nadir, MRM1 Rassvet, and MRM2 Poisk.       [The first copy remains on ISS, the second copy will be returned to the ground on Soyuz TMA-27.  “We, the Undersigned, have executed this Protocol to the effect that Volkov Sergey Alexandrovich, responsible for ISS-28/29 RS, handed over, and Shkaplerov Anton Nikolayevich, responsible for ISS 29/30 RS, accepted RS ISS, including special operating features, onboard system or equipment anomalies, equipment stowed for disposal at SM PrK location (per IMS data), Progress 413 items (per IMS data), MRM1, MRM2 equipment (per IMS data).”] 
 
The traditional “Change of Command” ceremony follows later today: it is scheduled at ~3:45pm-4:05pm EST with all six crewmembers, officially marking the transfer of the baton from Increment 29 to Increment 30, with Dan Burbank taking over Command from Mike Fossum.
 
In preparation for undocking, CDR Fossum later configures the Node-2 Port CQ (Crew Quarters) for the next “on-call” crewmember by connecting the Node-2 Port ATU (Audio Terminal Unit) #15 to the CQ ATU, then verifies correct speaker connectivity. 
 
Mike also will power down the amateur/ham radio stations in SM &amp; COL to prevent RF (radio frequency) interference during Soyuz undocking and departure activities.
 
FE-3 &amp; FE-5 had their standard PMCs (Private Medical Conferences) via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video, Satoshi at ~10:50am, Dan at ~12:25pm EST.
 
CDR &amp; FE-3 were scheduled for their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences), via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Dan at ~12:40pm, Mike at ~4:15pm EST.
 
Continuing the obligatory CMS (Countermeasures Systems) overview which is required of each new crewmember prior to the first physical exercised session, Mike Fossum today checked out Dan Burbank’s workouts on the ARED and T2/COLBERT equipment.
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol (abbreviated to 1 hr for the newcomers) on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-3, FE-5), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).
 
27S Descent Timeline Overview:
If everything proceeds nominally, the return to Earth of the “digitized” TMA-02M spacecraft tomorrow evening will proceed along the following approximate event sequence (all times EST):

What the Soyuz TMA-02M/27S crew will experience during their reentry/descent tonight: 
<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">For the reentry, Sergey, Mike &amp; Satoshi will wear the Russian Kentavr anti-G suit under their Sokol suits.    [The Kentavr garment is a protective anti-g suit ensemble to facilitate the return of a long-duration crewmember into the Earth gravity.  Consisting of shorts, gaiters, underpants, jersey and socks, it acts as countermeasure for circulatory disturbance, prevents crewmember from overloading during descent and increases orthostatic tolerance during post-flight adaptation.  Russian crewmembers are also advised to ingest fluid-electrolyte additives, viz., three sodium chloride tablets during breakfast and after the midday meal, each time with 300 ml of fluid, and two pills during the meal aboard Soyuz before deorbit.] </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">Before descent: 
Special attention will be paid to the need for careful donning of the medical belt with sensors and securing tight contact between sensors and body.  ECG electrodes are applied with paste.  Kentavr suits must have snug fit in lower body and calves. 
During preparation for descent, before atmosphere reentry, crewmembers settle down comfortably in the Kazbek couches, fasten the harness belts, securing tight contact between body and the seat liner in the couch.</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">During de-orbit:</li></ul><ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><ul style="margin-top:0in" type="circle"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level2 lfo5">Dust particles starting to sink in the Descent Module (SA) cabin is the first indication of atmosphere reentry and beginning of G-load effect.  From that time on, special attention is required as the loads increase rapidly. </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level2 lfo5">Under G-load effects during atmosphere reentry the crew expects the following experience: 
Sensation of G-load pressure on the body, heaviness of the body, labored breathing and speech. These are normal sensations, and the advice is to "take them coolly".  In case of the feeling of a lump in the throat, this is no cause to "be nervous".  This is frequent and should not be fought.  Best is to "try not to swallow and talk at this moment".  Crew should check vision and, if any disturbances occur, create additional tension of abdominal pressure and leg muscles (strain abdomen by pulling in), in addition to the Kentavr anti-G suit. </li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l3 level2 lfo5">During deployment of pilot parachute (0.62 &amp; 4.5 square meters), drogue chute (16 sq.m.) and main (518 sq.m.) chutes the impact accelerations will be perceived as a "strong jolt".  No reason to become concerned about this but one should be prepared that during the parachutes deployment and change ("rehook") of prime parachute to symmetrical suspension, swinging and spinning motion of the SA occurs, which involves vestibular (middle ear) irritations.</li></ul></ul><ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">It is important to tighten restrain system to fasten pelvis and pectoral arch. 
Vestibular irritation can occur in the form of different referred sensations such as vertigo, hyperhidrosis, postural illusions, general discomfort and nausea.  To prevent vestibular irritation the crew should "limit head movement and eyes movement", as well as fix their sight on a stationary object.</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">Just before the landing (softened by six small rocket engines behind the heat shield): 
Crew will be prepared for the vehicle impact with the ground, with their bodies fixed along the surface of the seat liner in advance and braced for ground impact.  "Special attention should be paid to arm fixation to avoid the elbow and hand squat" (instruction). Landing speed: ~9.9 m/sec.</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l4 level1 lfo4">After landing: 
Crew should not get up quickly from their seats to leave the SA.  They were advised to stay in the couch for several minutes and only then stand up.  In doing that, they should limit head and eyes movement and avoid excessive motions, proceeding slowly.  Their body should not take up earth gravity in the upright position too quickly.</li></ul>
