ISS On-Orbit Status 10/03/10
 
  All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     Sunday – crew rest day.   Ahead: Week 2 of Increment 25
 
  At wake-up, FE-5 Yurchikhin conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [FE-5 again inspects the filters before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
  CDR Wheelock &amp; FE-6 Walker continued their current week-long activity with the post-wakeup experiment SLEEP (Sleep-Wake Actigraphy &amp; Light Exposure during Spaceflight), 5<sup>th</sup> for both of them, transferring data from their Actiwatches to the HRF-1 (Human Research Facility 1) laptop.     [To monitor their sleep/wake patterns and light exposure during a SLKEEP session, crewmembers wear a special Actiwatch device which measures the light levels encountered by him/her as well as their patterns of sleep and activity throughout the Expedition, using the payload software for data logging and filling in questionnaire entries in the experiment’s laptop session file on the HRF-1 laptop.  The log entries are done within 15 minutes of final awakening for seven consecutive days.]
 
 Upon wake-up, the CDR performed a new session with the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.     [The RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift.  The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
  Walker completed Day 4 of her current 4-day session on the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), her 4<sup>th</sup> onboard run, with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.     [Under Pro K, the crewmember measures and logs the pH value of a urine sample, to be collected the same time of day every day for 4 days.  The crewmember also prepares a diet log and then annotates quantities of food packets consumed and supplements taken.]
 
  Doug Wheelock had Day 3 of his new Pro K session, his 4<sup>th</sup> on board.
 
  Shannon started her new 24-hr urine collections of the Generic HRF (Human Research Facility) urine sampling protocol, taking samples several times for MELFI (Minus Eighty Laboratory Freezer for ISS) sample storage.      [Based on crew feedback, new cold stowage hardware, and IPV (International Procedures Viewer) capabilities, the generic blood &amp; urine procedures for the HRP (Human Research Program) payloads were created to allow an individual crewmember to select their payload complement and see specific requirements populated.  Individual crewmembers will select their specific parameter in the procedures to reflect their science complement.  Different crewmembers will have different required tubes and hardware configurations, so they should verify their choice selection before continuing with operations to ensure their specific instruction.]
 
  Yurchikhin performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM (Service Module), including the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow.    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers.]
 
 Fyodor’s servicing activities included the periodic (weekly)  checkup of the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for reporting to TsUP.
 
  At ~5:50am EDT, the Exp-25 crew engaged in a PAO TV downlink for ESA at the annual celebration  of German Re-unification, this year (being the 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary) held in the City of Bremen.  Speaking from the COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) in view of VCA1 (Video Camera Assembly 1), the crewmembers downlinked congratulations and fielded questions from former Astronaut Thomas Reiter.      [The event took place at the Congress Center in Bremen with special support of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), the European Space Agency (ESA) and EADS Astrium.  Present at the event were the President of Federal Republic of Germany, Mr. Christian Wulff, the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Ms. Angela Merkel, and a large group of 1500 distinguished national and international guests.]
 
  CDR &amp; FE-6 have their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Shannon at ~1:10pm, Wheels at ~3:30pm EDT.
 
  The crew worked out on today’s 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation (FE-5), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (CDR, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-6) and VELO bike ergometer with bungee cord load trainer (FE-5).
 
  Jobs listed for Fyodor on the Russian discretionary “time permitting” task list today were –
 <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1">A ~30-min. session for      Russia's EKON      Environmental Safety Agency, making observations and taking KPT-3 aerial      photography of environmental conditions on Earth using the NIKON D3X      camera with the RSK-1      laptop, and</li> </ul> <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc"> <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l1 level1 lfo2">A photography session for      the DZZ-13 “Seiner”      ocean observation program, obtaining NIKON D3 photos with Nikkor 80-200 mm      lens and the SONY HD video camcorder on oceanic water blooms in the      central-eastern Atlantic areas, then copying the images to the RSK-1 laptop.</li> </ul> 
 ATV PCE Test:    Early this morning during crew sleep (~12:02am EDT, from DO2-DO3), ESA/Russia conducted a transmission test of the ATV PCE (Automated Transfer Vehicle Proximity Communications Equipment; Russian: MBRL), checking out its carrier frequency over the ISS external WAS2 antenna from RGS (Russian Ground Site).     [MBRL, in the SM, will be used for the approach &amp; docking of the European ATV-2 “Johannes Kepler”, currently planned to be launched 2/15/2011.]
