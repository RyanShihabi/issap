New Status:
Italian Combustion Experiment for Green Air (ICE GA) Experiment: Cassidy removed the alignment guides from the Combustion Integrated Rack (CIR) to unlock Passive Rack Isolation System (PaRIS) in preparation for the second run of the ICE GA experiment conducted by ground teams. This new ISS experiment investigates the burning characteristics of biologically derived fuels to help develop the use of environmentally-friendly fuels on Earth.
Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Checkout: Cassidy performed a screen test to assess the health of EMUs 3005 and 3010 water separator loops.  Due to the issues experienced with EMU 3011 during USOS EVA #23 when Parmitano’s helmet filled with water, specialists have determined that the EMU water separator loop is functioning outside of specification and allowing excessive amounts of water to enter the ventilation loop.  Preliminary findings reveal no visible water in the ducts.
Multi-purpose Small Payload Rack (MSPR): Following yesterday’s MSPR laptop maintenance, Nyberg set up the work bench and replaced the CO2 sensor and sensor box of the Combustion Chamber, followed by a functionality check. These activities are in preparation for future Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) commercial tasks. The MSPR is designed to accommodate several types of experiments including Aquatic Habitat (AQH), Combustion, and Crystal Growth.
Crew Medical Officer (CMO) On-Board Training (OBT): Cassidy completed his CMO OBT today. This is a Computer Based Training (CBT) module that requires no ground interaction and is performed periodically to maintain proficiency for designated CMOs. Nyberg completed her training session yesterday.
H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV)-4 Cargo Operations: Today, the crew performed 7.5 hours of cargo operations, completing an estimated 12.7 hours of transfer operations.  Stowage specialists estimate approximately 25 hours remain of cargo ops or approximately 69% complete.
