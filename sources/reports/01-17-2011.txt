ISS On-Orbit Status 01/17/11
 
 All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.     U.S. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY.    Underway: Week 9 of Increment 26.
 
 FE-2 Skripochka conducted the regular daily early-morning check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Oleg will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
 Oleg’s morning inspection today included the weekly checkup behind ASU/toilet panel 139 in the SM (Service Module) on a fluid connector (MNR-NS) of the SM-U urine collection system, looking for potential moisture.
 
 At wake-up, FE-4 Kondratyev terminated his 3<sup>rd</sup> experiment session, started last night, for the long-term Russian sleep study MBI-12/Sonokard, taking the recording device from his Sonokard sports shirt pocket and later copying the measurements to the RSE-Med laptop for subsequent downlink to the ground.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.] 
 
 FE-6 Coleman undertook her 5<sup>th</sup> weekly U.S. “Bisphosphonates” biomedical countermeasures experiment, ingesting an Alendronate pill before breakfast.  The required ~10h fast period started last night for her.      [The Bisphosphonates study should determine whether antiresorptive agents (that help reduce bone loss) in conjunction with the routine in-flight exercise program will protect ISS crewmembers from the regional decreases in bone mineral density documented on previous ISS missions.  Two dosing regimens are being tested: (1) an oral dose of 70 mg of Alendronate taken weekly starting 3 weeks prior to flight and then throughout the flight and (2) an intravenous (IV) dose of 4 mg Zoledronic Acid, administered just once approximately 45 days before flight. The rationale for including both Alendronate and Zoledronic Acid is that two dosing options will maximize crew participation, increase the countermeasure options available to flight surgeons, increase scientific opportunities, and minimize the effects of operational and logistical constraints.  The primary measurement objective is to obtain preflight and postflight QCT (Quantitative Computed Tomography) scans of the hip. The QCT scans will provide volumetric bone density information of both cortical and trabecular (spongy) bone regions of the hip.] 
 
 Before breakfast, Coleman also began another round of the periodic personal acoustic measurement protocol.  In Part 1, Cady distributed crew-worn acoustic dosimeters from the SMK (Sound Measurement Kit) to the 25S crew, i.e., Dmitri, Paolo &amp; herself, for a 24 hrs data take.      [Tomorrow, Scott Kelly will download the readings from the dosimeters.]
 
 Assisted by Skripochka, Kaleri spent several hours preparing the Progress M-08M/40P for its undocking on 1/24.  Activities include –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Installing the docking mechanism (StM, Stykovochnovo mekhanizma) between the cargo ship and the DC1 nadir port (done 1/14)    [the StM is the "classic" probe-and-cone type, consisting of an active docking assembly (ASA) with a probe (SSh), which fits into the cone (SK) on the passive docking assembly (PSA) for initial soft dock and subsequent retraction to hard dock.  The ASA is mounted on the Progress' cargo module (GrO), while the PSA sits on the docking ports of the SM, FGB, MRM2 and DC1],</li><li>Uninstalling &amp; removing the LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251MB) of the BITS2-12 onboard measurement telemetry, along with its ROM unit (read-only memory, TA765B) for re-use,</li><li>Activating the spacecraft’s electronics and taking out the ventilation/heating air duct; </li><li>Closing the DC1/40P hatches on TsUP Go (~4:50am EST); </li><li>Removing the QD (quick disconnect) screw clamps (BZV) of the docking &amp; internal transfer mechanism (SSVP) which rigidized the joint  [during clamp removal and leak checking, Russian thrusters were inhibited due to load constraints],</li><li>Starting the standard one-hour leak checking of the SU docking vestibule and fuel/oxidizer transfer line interface between Progress and DC1, and</li><li>Downlinking Kaleri’s formal report on loading completion and the video depicting the close-out activities, for review by ground specialists.</li> </ul> 
 Scott Kelly, Cady Coleman &amp; Paolo Nespoli had ~1h 30m set aside for an OBT (Onboard Training) session with the MSS SSRMS (Mobile Service System / Space Station Remote Manipulator System), performing Robotics proficiency procedures on the ROBoT training tool.     [The training was supported by ground instructor tagup and followed by a teleconference to discuss particulars.]
 
 In preparation of the Orlan suited dry-run tomorrow and the Russian EVA-27 on 1/21, CDR Kelly readied two D2Xs EVA still cameras and worked with FE-2 Skripochka on installing US EHIP (Extravehicular Mobility Helmet Interchangeable Portable) lights and WVS (Wireless Video System) camera on the Russian Orlan-MK spacesuits.
 
 Working in the DC1 Docking Compartment, FE-2 Skripochka &amp; FE-4 Kondratyev –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Installed the portable O<sub>2</sub> tanks (BK-3) and portable air repress bottles (BNP),</li><li>Set up Orlan BRTK “Korona” and BSS (EVA Interface Unit) comm configuration, running voice checks and testing medical parameter acquisition of the BETA-08 ECG (electrocardiograph) harnesses with the “Gamma-1M” med complex from the PKO med exam panel for vital signs &amp; equipment monitoring,</li><li>Installed Orlan attached hardware (OTA) and took photos of the outfitted Orlans for downlink [OTA equipment includes: right-hand swing arm with tool caddy, small trash bag, wire ties, tethers, camera, wrench and cutters],</li><li>Prepared auxiliary NASA equipment to be used in Orlan plus taking photos of the outfitted Orlans for downlink,</li><li>Mounted the Fresnel lens viewing aid in the helmets, and</li><li>Unstowed EVA emergency first-aid medical packs and staged them in the PkhO (Transfer Compartment) and DC1.</li> </ul> 
 Oleg, Dmitri &amp; Paolo had about an hour set aside for reviewing/studying EVA-27 flight procedures.
 
 Kondratyev conducted the periodic (monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new unit from FGB stowage (done last: 12/8).  The old unit was discarded and the IMS (Inventory Management System) updated.     [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
 In addition, FE-4 also completed –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>The periodic inspection of the SRV-K2M Condensate Water Processor’s sediment trap insert (VU) in the SM    [the Russian SRVK-2M converts collected condensate into drinking water and dispenses the reclaimed potable water],</li><li>Periodic routine maintenance in the SM’s ASU toilette facility, changing out replaceable parts with new components, such as a filter insert (F-V), the urine receptacle (MP), the pretreat container (E-K) with its hose and the DKiV pretreat &amp; water dispenser.  All old parts were trashed in Progress, and the IMS was updated,</li><li>The routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM,   [regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator], and</li><li>The daily IMS (Inventory Management System) maintenance, updating/editing its standard “delta file” including stowage locations, for the regular weekly automated export/import to its three databases on the ground (Houston, Moscow, Baikonur).</li> </ul> 
 FE-5 Nespoli worked in COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory), cleaning out cargo (an LCVG/ Liquid Cooling &amp; Ventilation Garment) and restowing it in the US Airlock C/L (Crewlock).
 
 FE-1 Kaleri again had ~1h reserved for shooting more “Chronicle” newsreel footage using the SONY HVR-Z7 #2 high-definition camcorder as part of the ongoing effort to create a photo &amp; video documentary database on the flight of ISS-26 (“Flight Chronicles”) for Telecanal Roskosmos.     [Footage subjects generally include conducting experiments, current activities at the station, repair activities behind panels, exercise, cosmonauts looking out the window at the Earth, Earth surface, station interior, cosmonaut in zero gravity, leisure, life on orbit, personal hygiene, meals, station exterior, comm. passes with the ground, ham radio passes, station cleaning, spacesuits, space hardware, MRM1, MRM2, DC1, FGB, Soyuz &amp; Progress, intermodular passageways, meeting a new crew, crewmember in space, medical experiments, handover activities, crew return preparations, farewell ceremonies, etc.  The photo/video imagery is saved digitally on HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) for return to Earth on Soyuz.]
 
 Scott Kelly broke out and set up the HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) Ultrasound equipment and undertook his first session as subject, with Cady Coleman assisting as CMO (Crew Medical Officer).  Later, FE-6 Coleman also performed the Ultrasound scans on Paolo Nespoli, who then took on the CMO duty for Cady’s first session as subject.     [Objective of the Ultrasound was an eye examination for both subjects.]
 
 Afterwards, Cady –
 <ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt; "> <li>Initiated another sampling run with the EHS GC/DMS (Environmental Health Systems Gas Chromatograph / Differential Mobility Spectrometer); deactivating the system ~5 hrs later    [this was the 10<sup>th</sup> session with the newly replaced GC/DMS unit #1004, after the previous instrument (#1002) was used for approximately 7 runs.  Also known as AQM (Air Quality Monitor), the system is controlled with “Sionex” expert software from the SSC (Station Support Computer)-12 laptop (due to a software glitch, the software needs to be opened, closed, and then reopened in order to ensure good communication between GC/DMS and SSC-12).  The AQM demonstrates COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) technology for identifying volatile organic compounds, similar to the VOA (Volatile Organics Analyzer).  This evaluation will continue over the course of several months as it helps to eventually certify the GC/DMS as nominal CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) hardware],</li><li>Reviewed CFE ICF (Capillary Flow Experiments / Interior Corner Flow) setup &amp; operations procedures in preparation for an upcoming research session with the test setup,</li><li>Reconfigured the PIP (Plug-in Plan) power equipment for the Robotics activities ahead [by moving SSC-20 (Station Support Computer 20) and its power string to another UOP (Utility Outlet Panel) and then deploying a new power string and a spare laptop to replace SSC-20 for use with the ROBoT application],</li><li>Set up the EarthKAM (Earth Knowledge Acquired by Middle School Students) payload components in the Lab WORF (Window Observation Research Facility) rack and activated camera &amp; software when the ground could be seen for camera focusing   [using the new EarthKAM software on SSC-20 which replaces the version used for the DCS 760 camera. This is the first use of the D2Xs Camera by EKAM and the first time that any images will be taken from the WORF. Students around the world are anxiously awaiting use of the higher resolution images], and</li><li>Closed the protective window shutters in Lab, Node-3/Cupola and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module) to protect against RS (Russian Segment) thrusters taking over control temporarily overnight for the Progress 40P propellant line purge (~12:40am EST).</li></ul> 
 Alex Kaleri performed the (roughly) annual functional testing of the two Russian SUDN pilot sighting instruments VP-2 &amp; “Puma” which he installed at SM (Service Module) window #8 for the checkup.     [The Puma Portable Zoom Viewfinder is used to view remote objects and determine their angular position in the SM coordinate system in order to provide geographical reference of observed terrestrial objects, and to determine the target vector in a specified coordinate system.  The 240K Pilot Sight (VP-2) is a collimator-type device for determining the direction to observed reference points relative to the station coordinate for geographical reference of observed terrestrial objects and to determine the direction vector to controlled &amp; uncontrolled objects and measure their angular sizes.]
 
 Kaleri also took documentary photos of the DTG temperature sensor at a BlP Console Logic Unit for the BVN Air Heater Fan in Soyuz TMA-01M/24S (#701, docked at MRM2).
 
 Oleg Skripochka completed another data collection session for the psychological MBI-16 Vzaimodejstvie (“Interactions”) program, accessing and completing the computerized study questionnaire on the RSE-Med laptop and saving the data in an encrypted file.  It was Oleg’s 7<sup>th</sup> run.    [The software has a “mood” questionnaire, a “group &amp; work environment” questionnaire, and a “critical incidents” log.  Results from the study, which is also mirrored by ground control subjects, could help to improve the ability of future crewmembers to interact safely and effectively with each other and with Mission Control, to have a more positive experience in space during multi-cultural, long-duration missions, and to successfully accomplish mission activities.]
 
 Before sleeptime, FE-1 unstowed and set up the equipment for a session with the Russian crew health monitoring program's medical assessment MO-9/Biochemical Urinalysis, to be taken tomorrow by himself &amp; Nespoli.     [MO-9 is conducted every 30 days (and also before and after EVAs) and is one of five nominal Russian medical tests adopted by NASA for U.S. crewmembers for IMG PHS (Integrated Medical Group/Periodic Health Status) evaluation as part of the "PHS/Without Blood Labs" exam, also conducted today.  The analysis uses the sophisticated in-vitro diagnostic apparatus Urolux developed originally by Boehringer (Mannheim/Germany) for the Mir program.  Afterwards, the data are entered in the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer)’s special IFEP software (In-Flight Examination Program).]
 
 Oleg undertook the regular monthly session of the CHeCS (Crew Health Care Systems) emergency medical operations OBT (On-Board Training) drill, a 30-min. exercise to refresh his CMO (Crew Medical Officer) acuity in a number of critical health areas.  The video-based proficiency drill today focused on airway issues.  [The HMS (Health Maintenance Systems) hardware, including ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) equipment, may be used in contingency situations where crew life is at risk.  To maintain proficiency, crewmembers spend one hour per month reviewing HMS and ACLS equipment and procedures via the HMS and ACLS CBT (computer-based training).  The training drill, each crewmember for him/herself, refreshes their memory of the on-orbit stowage and deployment locations, equipment etc. and procedures.] 
 
 Scott performed the monthly maintenance of the T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill, checking its components, pin alignment, rack centering and the snubber jam nut witness marks.      [Witness marks (12 total) are applied to the X-, Y- &amp; Z-axis jam nuts on each (of four) snubber arm; their inspection serves to determine to what degree and which jam nuts are backing off.]
 
 The CDR also removed the 4 alignment guides from CIR (Combustion Integrated Rack) to allow PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System) to be activated before begin of CIR operations requiring a microgravity environment.
 
 Before sleeptime, FE-2 Skripochka will set up the Russian MBI-12 payload and start his 9<sup>th</sup> Sonokard experiment session, using a sports shirt from the Sonokard kit with a special device in the pocket for testing a new method for acquiring physiological data without using direct contact on the skin.  Measurements are recorded on a data card for return to Earth.      [Sonokard objectives are stated to (1) study the feasibility of obtaining the maximum of data through computer processing of records obtained overnight, (2) systematically record the crewmember’s physiological functions during sleep, (3) study the feasibility of obtaining real-time crew health data.  Investigators believe that contactless acquisition of cardiorespiratory data over the night period could serve as a basis for developing efficient criteria for evaluating and predicting adaptive capability of human body in long-duration space flight.]
 
 At ~12:50pm EST, Scott Kelly had his regular PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
 The crewmembers worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise on the TVIS treadmill (FE-1, FE-2, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR, FE-5, FE-6) and VELO ergometer bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1, FE-4).     [T2 snubber arm inspection is no longer needed after every T2 session but must be done after the last T2 session of the day.]
 
 No CEO (Crew Earth Observation) targets uploaded today.
