ISS On-Orbit Status 09/04/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.      Crew off-duty day.   Ahead:  Week 25 of Increment 28.   
 
As part of the regular Daily Morning Inspection, FE-1 Samokutyayev performed the routine checkup of the SM (Service Module) PSS Caution &amp; Warning panel.
 
CDR Borisenko continued Part 2 of the series of the Russian ASN-M Satellite Navigation System, monitoring communications every 2 hrs during work hours between the RSK2 A31p laptop carrying the test program and the three active ASN NPM-1, NPM-3 &amp; NPM-4 navigation electronics modules.  At ~2:00pm EDT, Andrey terminated the test program, closed the data recording application and downlinked its entire contents to the ground via OCA.  Tomorrow, ASN-M will be restored to nominal configuration and the disconnected cables &amp; RSK2 A31p laptop stowed.         [The objective of the test was to confirm that array configurations for ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) docking in negative Solar Beta angles do not create unacceptable multipathing for the ASN RGPS (Relative Global Positioning System).  Part 1 had been tested during positive Betas.  Both TRRJs (Thermal Radiator Rotary Joints) and both SARJs (Solar Alpha Rotary Joints) plus the 1B, 2B, 3A &amp; 4A BGAs (Beta Gimbal Assemblies) were placed in Directed position for this test (i.e., not autotrack).  The test included 4 different array configurations with periods of autotrack in between for power generation recovery.]
 
Samokutyayev performed his 3<sup>rd</sup> preliminary (predvariteljnaya) ODNT orthostatic hemodynamic endurance test run with the Russian Chibis suit in preparation for his return to gravity on 9/16 with Soyuz 26S (along with CDR Borisenko &amp; FE-3 Garan).  Sasha conducted the exercise protocol in the below-the-waist reduced-pressure ODNT device (US: LBNP/Lower Body Negative Pressure) on the T2/COLBERT treadmill, assisted by Andrey Borisenko as CMO (Crew Medical Officer) and supported by ground tagup via VHF at 6:29am-6:53am EDT.  
 
Afterwards, Andrey also underwent the 3<sup>rd</sup> preliminary ODNT run, assisted by Sasha and ground tagup at 8:03am-8:22am.        [The Chibis provides gravity-simulating stress to the body’s cardiovascular/circulatory system for evaluation of the crewmember’s orthostatic tolerance (e.g., the Gauer-Henry reflex) after his long-term stay in zero-G.  Data output includes blood pressure readings.  The preparatory training generally consists of first imbibing 150-200 milliliters of water or juice, followed by one cycle of a sequence of progressive regimes of reduced (“negative”) pressure, today set at -25, -30, -35, and -40 mmHg for five min. each, while shifting from foot to foot at 10-12 steps per minute, while wearing a sphygmomanometer to measure blood pressure and the REG SHKO Rheoencephalogram Biomed Cap.  The body’s circulatory system interprets the pressure differential between upper and lower body as a gravity-like force pulling the blood (and other liquids) down.  Chibis data and biomed cardiovascular readings are recorded.  The Chibis suit (not to be confused with the Russian “Pinguin” suit for spring-loaded body compression, or the "Kentavr" anti-g suit worn during reentry) is similar to the U.S. LBNP facility (not a suit) used for the first time on Skylab in 1973/74, although it appears to accomplish its purpose more quickly.]
 
For today’s VolSci (Voluntary Weekend Science) activities, FE-6 Fossum powered up the ESA ERB-2 Erasmus Recording Binocular 2) in support of file transfers from ERB-2 to the EDR (European Drawer Rack) where ground commanding transferred the video files to the COL DMS MMU (Columbus Orbital Laboratory / Data Management System / Mass Memory Unit) and from there later to the ground.  Activities were time limited for thermal reasons.      [The stereoscopic ERB-2 has produced the first live 3-D video images in the 50-year history of spaceflight aboard the ISS for ESA's Research &amp; Technology Center in the Netherlands.]
 
FE-4 Volkov conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.  This included the weekly collection of the toilet flush (SP) counter and water supply (SVO) readings for calldown to TsUP-Moscow, as well as the weekly checkup on the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air filter unit of the SM’s &amp; FGB’s SOGS air revitalization subsystem, gathering weekly data on total operating time &amp; “On” durations for calldown.      [SOZh servicing includes checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers and replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers].
 
Sergei also performed the daily inspection of the recently activated Russian BIO-5 Rasteniya-2 ("Plants-2") payload with its LADA-01 greenhouse and ensured proper watering of the KM A32 &amp; A24 root modules.        [Rasteniya-2 researches growth and development of plants (currently wheat) under spaceflight conditions in the LADA greenhouse from IBMP (Institute of Bio-Medical Problems, Russian: IMBP)],
 
FE-3 Garan opened the protective window shutters of the Lab WORF (Window Observational Research Facility) for the ISSAC (ISS Agriculture Camera) equipment, so ground images can be captured today by ground commanding.  At sleeptime tonight, Ron will close the shutters again.      [ISSAC takes frequent visible-light &amp; infrared images of vegetated areas on the Earth.  The camera focuses principally on rangelands, grasslands, forests, and wetlands in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  The images may be delivered directly upon request to farmers, ranchers, foresters, natural resource managers and tribal officials to help improve their environmental stewardship of the land.  The images will also be shared with educators for classroom use.]
 
The crew worked out with their regular 2-hr physical exercise protocol on the CEVIS cycle ergometer with vibration isolation (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), TVIS treadmill with vibration isolation &amp; stabilization (FE-1, FE-4), ARED advanced resistive exercise device (FE-3, FE-5, FE-6), T2/COLBERT advanced treadmill (CDR/2x, FE-1), and VELO ergometer bike with load trainer (FE-4).
