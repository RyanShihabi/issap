Actiwatch-Plus: Actiwatch units were doffed from two crewmembers. The Actiwatch-Plus is a waterproof, non-intrusive, sleep-wake activity monitor worn on the wrist of a crewmember and contains a miniature uniaxial accelerometer that produces a signal as the subject moves. The data is stored in non-volatile memory within the Actiwatch until it is downloaded for analysis.

USOS ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) Preparation Operations: The majority of crew operations today were in preparation for the USOS Radio Frequency Groups (RFG) EVA taking place on Wednesday, November 1st. The crew performed activities such as a pre-EVA Health Examination, Robotics WorkStation (RWS) setup, Equipment Lock Preparation, an EVA Cuff Checklist print, and a group EVA Procedure Review & Conference. During the RFG EVA, the crew will retrieve the RFG for ingress and disassembly, as well as Remove and Replace (R&R) the Trundle Bearing Assembly (TBA) on the Port Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ).
Urine Transfer System (UTS) Offload EDV Swap: Today, the crew swapped the EDV in the offload EDV spot of the UTS. The main objective of the UTS is to provide automated control of urine flow from Toilet System and Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC) or from external storage containers into the UPA Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly (WSTA).
