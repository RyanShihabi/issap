ISS On-Orbit Status 04/09/11
 
All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.    Saturday – Crew rest day.
 
Upon wake-up (2:00am EDT), FE-2 Borisenko performed the regular daily check of the aerosol filters at the Russian Elektron O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen) generator which Maxim Suraev had installed on 10/19/09 in gaps between the BZh Liquid Unit and the oxygen outlet pipe (filter FA-K) plus hydrogen outlet pipe (filter FA-V).     [Andrey will inspect the filters again before bedtime tonight, currently a daily requirement per plan, with photographs to be taken if the filter packing is discolored.]
 
FE-3 Garan, FE-5 Nespoli &amp; FE-6 Coleman completed a post-sleep session of the Reaction Self Test (Psychomotor Vigilance Self Test on the ISS) protocol.  It was the 22<sup>nd</sup> for Paolo &amp; Cady, the first for Ron.      [RST is done twice daily (after wakeup &amp; before bedtime) for 3 days prior to the sleep shift, the day(s) of the sleep shift and 5 days following a sleep shift. The experiment consists of a 5-minute reaction time task that allows crewmembers to monitor the daily effects of fatigue on performance while on ISS.  The experiment provides objective feedback on neurobehavioral changes in attention, psychomotor speed, state stability, and impulsivity while on ISS missions, particularly as they relate to changes in circadian rhythms, sleep restrictions, and extended work shifts.]
 
CDR Kondratyev terminated the maintenance discharge on 825M3 Orlan battery pack #1262431133 and removed it from the charge/discharge device.
 
In the newly arrived Soyuz TMA-21/26S, FE-1 Samokutyayev worked in the Orbital Module (BO), installing and connecting the electronic LKT local temperature sensor commutator (TA251M1B) of the BITS2-12 onboard telemetry measurement system and its TA765B/PZU-1M ROM (read-only memory) unit from SM (Service Module) stowage, recycled from an earlier vehicle.
 
Dmitri Kondratyev conducted the periodic (~monthly) maintenance on the temporarily deactivated Russian IK0501 GA (Gas Analyzer) of the SOGS Pressure Control &amp; Atmospheric Monitoring System behind SM panel 449 by replacing its CO<sub>2</sub> filter assembly (BF) with a new unit from FGB stowage (done last: 2/28).  The old unit was discarded and the IMS (Inventory Management System) updated.     [IK0501 is an automated system for measuring CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O in the air, as well as the flow rate of the gas being analyzed.]
 
As generally on Saturdays, the crewmembers joined in conducting the regular weekly three-hour task of thorough cleaning of their home, including COL (Columbus Orbital Laboratory) and Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module).       ["Uborka", usually done on Saturdays, includes removal of food waste products, cleaning of compartments with vacuum cleaner, damp cleaning of the SM (Service Module) dining table, other frequently touched surfaces and surfaces where trash is collected, as well as the sleep stations with a standard cleaning solution; also, fan screens and grilles are cleaned to avoid temperature rises. Special cleaning is also done every 90 days on the HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) bacteria filters in the Lab.]
 
As part of the uborka house cleaning, CDR, FE-1 &amp; FE-2 completed regular maintenance inspection &amp; cleaning of fan screens in the FGB (TsV2) plus Group E fan grilles (VPkhO, FS5, FS6, VP) in the SM and the Russian POTOK-150MK (150 micron) air purification subsystems (UOV) in the SM &amp; FGB, cleaning the pre-filters with a vacuum cleaner with narrow nozzle attachment and later restarting POTOK in automatic mode.
 
FE-6 Coleman continued pumping urine from an EDV-U container into the UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) as required, initiated yesterday.     [For now, the WRS (Water Recovery System) EDV-U remains connected to the WSTA (Wastewater Storage Tank Assembly) via EDV transfer hose and the Russian compressor, powered from the Ku-band power source.  The WSTA should be filled to 70%, with an additional pumping opportunity scheduled tomorrow, if required, in order to allow the planned RFTA (Recycle Filter Tank Assembly) replacement on Monday.]
 
Andrey Borisenko conducted the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS) in the SM.     [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and filling EDV-SV, KOV (for Elektron), EDV-ZV &amp; EDV on RP flow regulator.]
 
Working on the MEC (Medical Equipment Computer), Ron Garan transferred the contents of his designated folder to his CEVIS (Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation) PCMCIA memory card which includes his automated CEVIS protocol. 
 
After yesterday’s obligatory CMS (Countermeasures Systems) exercise overview, to get cleared for CMS Ron today received the hands-on training on the use of the exercise apparatus by observing experienced crewmembers – Paolo Nespoli on ARED &amp; Cady Coleman on CEVIS.
 
Before sleeptime (5:30pm EDT), Paolo will unstow and prepare the equipment for his 4<sup>th </sup>suite of sessions with the medical protocol Pro K (Dietary Intake Can Predict and Protect against Changes in Bone Metabolism during Spaceflight and Recovery), with controlled diet and diet logging after the urine pH spot test.  Paolo will begin the urine sampling for pH value tomorrow, for a 5-day period.
 
FE-1 &amp; FE-2 had their weekly PFCs (Private Family Conferences) via S-band/audio and Ku-band/MS-NetMeeting application (which displays the uplinked ground video on an SSC laptop), Sasha at ~6:00am, Andrey at ~10:30am EDT.
 
At ~1:20pm, Ron Garan had his 2<sup>nd</sup> post-launch PMC (Private Medical Conference), via S- &amp; Ku-band audio/video.
 
At ~5:15am EDT, the three Russian crewmembers conducted a Russian PAO TV interview by Vadim Takmenyov for Central TV and NTV which are working on a big show dedicated to the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first human flight to space, to be aired on April 10.
 
At ~8:45am, Ron, Paolo, Cady, Dima, Andrey &amp; Sasha supported a Russian PAO TV event, downlinking messages of greetings to the participants of the London International Book Fair, answering questions from the viewers of BBC TV Channel.      [On April 11-15, Russia’s Federal Agency for Mass Communications &amp; Printing along with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is hosting in London a show -“Russia is a Guest of Honor at London Book Fair”.  Leading public organizations in the area of literature and publishing, Russian writers, painters, translators, publishers, media managers will be participating in this show.  The organizers of the show agreed with the BBC TV channel that on 4/12, when the whole world is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first human flight to space, TV channel viewers will be asking ISS crew some questions.   “….Hello from the cosmonauts and astronauts aboard the International Space Station to everyone at The London Book Fair.  We hope you’re having fun celebrating Russian literature at the London Book Fair…..”]
 
At ~10:10am, the six crewmembers held the regular WPC (Weekly Planning Conference) with the ground, discussing next week's "Look-Ahead Plan" (prepared jointly by MCC-H and TsUP-Moscow timeline planners), via S-band/audio, reviewing upcoming activities and any concerns about future on-orbit events.
 
At ~11:05am, in a Russian PAO TV event the station crew downlinked answers to questions from residents of the city of Izhevsk, capital of the Russian Republic of Udmurtia – and the city which erected a monument to a dog.      [In a letter to the crew, Izhvesk residents wrote: “Dear space residents of Planet Earth, on behalf of Izhevsk city residents we would like to wish you happy 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the first human flight of Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin to space.  Our city completed preparation for his flight:  Here on March 25, 1961, we were welcoming the return of the last test satellite-craft, on which the dog Zvezdochka (“Sprocket”) flew to space.  Five years ago we built a monument dedicated to the 45<sup>th</sup> anniversary of space flights, where we listed the names of designers, test engineers, medical personnel, those who built the road to space.  For this reason we are celebrating Cosmonautics Day two weeks earlier than everybody else.  To commemorate the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Y. A. Gagarin’s flight we opened Cosmonauts Park in Izhevsk.  Your answers will be heard by Izhevsk residents at the meeting near the monument to Zvezdochka and during folk festival in Cosmonauts Park.]
 
At ~12:10pm, Dmitri Kondratyev, Ron Garan, Alexandr Samokutyayev, Katherine Coleman, Andrey Borisenko &amp; Paolo Nespoli downlinked PAO TV greetings to 3 major Russian events, with portraits of K.E. Tsiolkovsky, S.P., Korolev and Yuri Gagarin in the background:
