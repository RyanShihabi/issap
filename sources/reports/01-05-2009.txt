All ISS systems continue to function nominally, except those noted previously or below.   Underway: Week 11 of Increment 18. 
 
 Before breakfast, FE-2 Magnus began Part 1 (of 5) of the periodic acoustic measurement protocol by deploying crew-worn acoustic dosimeters, to be carried by all crewmembers for 24 hours (with a microphone on the shirt collar).  (Last time done: 11/3-11/4).    [Tonight, after about 15 hours of measurements, dosimeter data will be downloaded and the hardware power-cycled for another data take starting tonight after 8.5-hr. sleep.  At that point, the crew will deploy the dosimeters statically in the station for the duration of the day, record measurements tomorrow noon and stow the instruments.  Acoustic data must be taken twice per Increment, each time for the duration of the 16-hour crew workday.] 
 
 After setting up the video camcorder in the Lab for live ground monitoring, FE-2 Magnus &amp; CDR Fincke spent most of their workday on setting up, installing and outfitting the new FCF CIR (Fluids &amp; Combustions Facility/Combustion Integrated Rack), a week-long task, proceeding through a number of carefully choreographed steps:
 
 <ul><li>Installing the CIR PaRIS (Passive Rack Isolation System),  <li>Rotating the CIR rack down and restraining it, to allow installation of ARIS Center Pins,  <li>Removing the CIR Optics Bench launch bolts,  <li>Completing outfitting the CIR with the PaRIS,  <li>Mating the PaRIS umbilical, then the CIR umbilicals,  <li>Removing four spacer plates from the CIR,  <li>Opening the front end cap of CIR's combustion chamber,  <li>Removing the rack's window strut attachment,  <li>Installing eight chamber windows, Part 1 (A to H),  <li>Closing the chamber front end cap,  <li>Installing more components on the Optics Bench, and  <li>Installing CIR I/O (Input/Output) processor hard drives in the FCF (Fluids &amp; Combustion Facility) to complete MDCA (Multi-user Droplet Combustion Apparatus) outfitting, and  <li>Closing the upper &amp; lower FCF doors.

 [The MDCA is a multi-user facility designed to accommodate different droplet combustion science experiments, using the CIR of the NASA Glenn Research Center's FCF.  The MDCA, in conjunction with the CIR, will allow for cost effective extended access to the microgravity environment, not possible on previous space flights.  The MDCA contains the hardware and software required to conduct unique droplet combustion experiments in space.  It consists of a CIA (Chamber Insert Assembly), an Avionics Package, and a multiple array of diagnostics.] 
 
 FE-1 Lonchakov, assisted by Magnus acting as photo subject, conducted a familiarization tagup with ground specialists on the new Russian experiment OBR-2/Mati-75, then performed the experiment for three cases with recording by videocam.    [OBRAZOVANIE (Education) is a class of educational demonstrations of science in micro-G.  OBR-2/MATI-75 was developed by the students and staff of MATI, K. E. Tsiolkovsky Russian State Technological University, and is dedicated to the 150th Anniversary of the founder of the theoretical space science and 75th Anniversary of MATI.  It is a demonstration of the shape and size recovery (memory) of blanks made from cellular polymeric materials (Poroplast) in microgravity.  Poroplastic pieces have been precompressed on the ground, approximately 10 times to their original size, and preserved in this condition until delivery to the ISS.  When heated to a certain temperature, foamed polymers should recover their original size and shape, and after cooling, they retain and regain their stiffness and strength.  Laminar cellular polymeric-based composites with memory effect belong to the so-called smart technologies and will allow creating on the ground space-saving collapsible light-weight but large-scale space structures to be delivered to the required location, where they, when commanded, and under the impact of certain internal or external factors spontaneously can assume and retain operational shape and size. This cutting-edge technology has significant advantages over emerging technologies for mechanically deployed or inflatable reinforced large-scale structures. This technology can be applied not only in building structures in near-Earth orbits but in deep space or other planets, as well as on the ground.]
 
 The FE-1 gathered and transferred cables for the SUBA/Onboard Equipment Control System from the USOS (US Segment) to the RS (Russian Segment).
 
 Afterwards, Yuri deinstalled the battery of the Holter arterial BP (blood pressure) device of the CARD (cardiology) experiment.
 
 In the JAXA Kibo JPM (JEM Pressurized Module), Magnus installed the ELKT (Experiment Laptop Terminal) for the DomeGene experiment, connecting it with cables to the Saibo Rack.  Documentary imagery was taken with a D2X still camera after the installation.     [DomGene involves the culturing two kinds of amphibian cell lines: an A-6 cell line derived from a kidney and A-8 cell line derived from a liver, which show different types of cell differentiation and morphogenesis. While they are cultured under micro-G, researchers want to observe the shape and state of the cells, plus examine the known and unknown gene expression by DNA array assay using fixed and frozen recovery samples.]
 
 Yuri spent some time recharging batteries for the Russian RS2 laptop.
 
 Afterwards, the FE-1 performed routine service on the Matryoshka-R radiation payload via its Lulin-5 electronics box, checking and adjusting date/time, taking readings and entering time tag.
 
 Lonchakov also completed another collection of the periodic readings of potentially harmful atmospheric contaminants in the SM (Service Module), using the CMS (Countermeasure System), a component of the SKDS GANK-4M Real-Time Harmful Contaminant Gas Analyzer suite, today using preprogrammed microchips to measure for o-Xylol (1,2-Dimethylbenzol, C8H10) and Methyl-Mercaptan (Methanethiol, CH4S).
 
 In the SM, FE-1 Lonchakov performed the routine daily servicing of the SOZh system (Environment Control &amp; Life Support System, ECLSS).    [Regular daily SOZh maintenance consists, among else, of checking the ASU toilet facilities, replacement of the KTO &amp; KBO solid waste containers, replacement of EDV-SV waste water and EDV-U urine containers and performing US condensate processing (transfer from CWC to EDV containers) if condensate is available.] 
 
 Sandy Magnus conducted the weekly and monthly maintenance on the TVIS treadmill, primarily checking the condition of the SPDs (subject positioning devices) and recording time &amp; date values.  The monthly inspection includes a checkup of the Russian and US tie-down harnesses for any damage.
 
 Yuri took photographs of his Russian TVIS harness which is showing some damage, for ground inspection.
 
 The station residents conducted their regular daily 2.5-hr. physical workout program (about half of which is used for setup &amp; post-exercise personal hygiene) on the TVIS treadmill (CDR, FE-1, FE-2), RED resistive exerciser (CDR, FE-2) and VELO bike with bungee cord load trainer (FE-1).
 
 At ~2:30pm EST, the FE-2 is scheduled for a teleconference with structures &amp; mechanics specialists on the ground to discuss current CQ (Crew Quarter) rack status.
 
 Expose-R Update:   The Russian EXPOSE-R installation failure during EVA-21 was probably due to incorrect preparation of some connections during payload preparation. Langmuir Probe data have not been received yet, although hardware appears to be functioning.  Moscow may propose a second EVA at the end of January.
 TOCA, UPA &amp; ARED Update:  Troubleshooting is underway on the ground to bring the TOCA (Total Organic Carbon Analyzer), UPA (Urine Processor Assembly) and ARED (Advanced Resistive Exercise Device) into service later this week.
